the following is a conversation with tucker carlson a highly influential and often controversial political commentator when he was at fox time magazine called him the most powerful conservative in america after fox he has continued to host big impactful interviews and shows on x on the tucker carlson podcast and on tucker carlson dot com i recommend subscribing even if you disagree with his views it is always good to explore diversity of perspectives most recently he interviewed the president of russia vladimir putin we discussed this the topic of russia putin navalny and the war in ukraine at length in this conversation please allow me to say a few words about the very fact that i did this interview i have received a lot of criticism publicly and privately when i announced that i will be talking with tucker for people who think i shouldn't do the conversation with tucker or generally think that there are certain people i should never talk to i'm sorry but i disagree i will talk to everyone as long as they're willing to talk genuinely in long form for two three four more hours i will talk to putin and to zelensky to trump and to biden to tucker and to john stewart aoc obama and many more people with very different views on the world i want to understand people and ideas that's what long form conversations are supposed to be all about now for people who criticize me for not asking tough questions i hear you but again i disagree i do often ask tough questions but i try to do it in a way that doesn't shut down the other person putting them into a defensive state where they give only shallow talking points instead i'm looking always for the expression of genuinely held ideas and the deep roots of those ideas when done well this gives us a chance to really hear out the guest and to begin to understand what and how they think and i trust the intelligence of you the listener to make up your own mind to see through the bullshit to the degree there's bullshit and to see to the heart of the person sometimes i feel at this but i'll continue working my ass off to improve all that said i find that this no tough questions criticism often happens when the guest is a person the listener simply hates and wants to see them grilled into embarrassment called a liar a greedy egomaniac a killer maybe even an evil human being and so on if you are such a listener what you want is drama not wisdom in this case this show is not for you there are many shows you can go to for that with hosts that are way more charismatic and entertaining than i'll ever be if you

is a lex fridman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's tucker carlson what was your first impression when you met vladimir putin for the interview i thought he seemed nervous and i was very surprised by that and i thought he seemed like someone who'd overthought it a little bit who had a plan and and i don't think that's the right way to go into any interview my strong sense having done a lot of them for a long time is that it's better to know what you think to say you know as much as you can honestly so you don't get confused by your own lies and just to be yourself and i thought that he went into it like an overprepared student and and i i kept thinking why is why is he nervous but you know i guess because he thought a lot of people were gonna see it but he was also probably prepared to to give you a full lesson in history as he did well i was totally shocked by that and very annoyed because i thought he was filibustering i thought he i mean i asked him as i usually do the most obvious dumbest question ever which is you know why'd you do this and he had said in a speech that i think is worth reading i don't speak russian so i i haven't heard it in the original but he had said at the moment of the beginning of the war he had given this address to russians in which he explained to the fullest extent we have seen so far why he was doing this and he said in that speech i fear that nato the west the united states the biden administration will preemptively attack us and i thought well that's interesting i mean i i can't evaluate whether that's a fear rooted in reality or or one rooted in paranoia but i thought well that's well that's an answer right there and so i alluded to that in my question and rather than answering it he went off on this long from my perspective kind of tiresome sort of greatest hits of russian history and the implication i thought was well ukraine is ours or eastern ukraine is ours already and i thought he was doing that to avoid answering the question so you know the last thing you want when you're interviewing someone is to get rolled and i didn't wanna be rolled so i a couple of times interrupted him politely i thought but he wasn't having it and then i thought you know what i'm not here to prove that i'm a great interviewer it's kind of not about me i wanna know who this guy is i think a western audience a global audience has a right to know more about the guy and so just let him talk you know because it's not you know i don't feel like my reputation's on the line people have already drawn conclusions about me i suppose to the extent they have i'm not interested really in those conclusions anyway so just let them talk and so i calmed down and just let him talk and in retrospect i thought that was really really interesting you know whether you agree with it or not or whether you think it's relevant to the war in ukraine or not that was his answer and so it's inherently significant well you said he was nervous were you nervous were you afraid this is vladimir putin well i wasn't afraid at all and i wasn't nervous at all did you drink tea beforehand no i did my my normal regimen of nicotine pouches and coffee no i'm not a tea drinker i tried not to eat you know all the sweets they put in front of us which is that that is my weakness is eating crap but you eat a lot of sugar before as you know before an interview and it and it does dull you so i i successfully resisted that but i no i wasn't nervous i wasn't nervous the whole time i was there why would i be you know i'm fifty four my kids are grown i believe in god you know i'm not i'm almost never nervous but no i wasn't nervous i was just interested i mean i couldn't i you know i'm interested in soviet history i studied it in college i've read about it my entire life my dad you know worked in the cold war it was a constant topic of conversation and so to be in the kremlin in a room where stalin made decisions either wartime decisions or decisions about murdering his own population i just i just couldn't get over it you know we're in molotov's old office so for me that was i was just blown away by that i knew i thought i knew a lot about russia it turns out i knew a lot about the soviet period you know the nineteen thirty seven purge trials the famine in ukraine like i knew a fair amount about that but i really knew nothing about contemporary russia less than i thought i did it turned out and but yeah i was just i was just blown away by where we were and that's kind of one of the main drivers at this stage in my life of you know that that's why i do what i do is because i'm interested in stuff and i wanna see as much as i can and try and draw conclusions from it to the extent i can so i was very much caught up in that but no i wasn't nervous i didn't think he was gonna like kill me or something and i'm not particularly afraid of that anyway so not afraid of dying not really no i mean again it's a tie you know it's it's an age and stage in life thing i mean i've i've four children so there were times when they were little where i was terrified of dying because if i died it would have huge consequences but no i mean at this point i don't wanna die i'm really enjoying my life but i've been with the same girl for forty years and i have four children who i'm extremely close to well now five a daughter-in-law and i love them all i'm really close to them i told them i love them every day i i don't i've had a really interesting life what was the goal just linger on that what was the goal for the interview like like how were you thinking about it what would success be like in your head leading into it to bring more information disinformation public yeah that's it i mean i have really strong feelings about what's you know happening not just in ukraine or russia but around the world i think the world is resetting to to the grave disadvantage of the united states i don't think most americans are aware of that at all and so that's my view and i've i've stated it many times because it's sincere but my goal was to have more information brought to the west so people could make their own decisions about whether this is a good idea i mean i just i guess i reject the whole premise of the war in ukraine from the american perspective which is you know a tiny group of dumb people in washington has decided to do this for reasons they won't really explain and you don't have a role in it at all as an american citizen as the person who's paying for it whose children might be drafted to fight it you know to shut up and obey i just i just reject that completely you know i'm a i think i guess i'm a child of a different era i'm a child of participatory democracy to some extent where your opinion as a citizen is not irrelevant and so i i i'm just and i guess the level of lying about it was starting to drive me crazy and i've said and i will say again i am not an expert on the region or really any region other than say western maine i just don't you know i'm not russian and but it was obvious to me that we were being lied to in ways that were just it was crazy the scale of the lies and i'll just give you one example the idea that ukraine would inevitably win this war now victory was never as it never is defined precisely nothing's ever defined precisely which is always to tell that there's deception at the heart of the claim but ukraine's on the verge of winning well i don't know i mean i'm hardly a tactician or a military expert for the fifth time i'm not an expert on russia or ukraine i just look at wikipedia russia has a hundred million more people than ukraine a hundred million it has much deeper industrial capacity war material capacity than all of nato combined for example russia is turning out artillery shells which are you know significant in a ground war at a ratio of seven to one compared to all nato countries combined that's all of europe russia is producing seven times the artillery shells as all of europe combined what that's an amazing fact and it turns out to be a really significant fact in fact the significant fact but if you ask your average person in this country even a fairly well informed person of good faith who's just trying to understand what's going on who's gonna win this war well ukraine's gonna win they're on the right side and they think that because our media who who really just do serve the interest of the us government period they are state media in that sense have told them that for over two years and i i i was in hungary last summer talking to the prime minister viktor orban who's a you know whatever you think of he's a very smart guy very smart guy like smart on a scale that we're not used to in our leaders and i said to him off camera so is ukraine gonna win and he looked at me like i was deranged like or i was congenitally you know deficient are they gonna win no of course they can't win that's tiny compared to russia russia has a wartime economy ukraine doesn't really have an economy no look at the populations he was like looked at me like i was stupid and i said to him you know i think most americans believe that because nbc news and cnn and all the news channels all of them tell them that because it's framed exclusively in moral terms and it's churchill versus hitler and of course churchill's gonna prevail in the end and it's just so dishonest that even it doesn't even matter what i want to happen or what i think ought to happen that's a distortion of what is happening and if i have any job at all which i sort of don't actually at this point but if i do have a job it's to just try to be honest and that's a why there is a more nuanced discussion about what winning might look like you're right a nuanced discussion is not being had but it is possible for ukraine to quote unquote win with the help of united states i i guess that conversation needs to begin by defining terms and the key term is when what does that mean peace a ceasefire who owns which land yes coming to the table with as you call the parent in the united states yes putting leverage on the negotiation to make sure there's a fairness amen well i of course as a and and i should just restate this i am not emotionally involved in this i'm american in every sense and my only interest is in america i'm not leaving ever and so i'm looking at this purely from our perspective what's good for us but i also as a human being as a christian i mean i i hate war and anybody who doesn't hate war shouldn't have power in my opinion so i agree with those that definition vehemently a victory is like not killing an entire generation of your population it's not being completely destroyed to be eaten up by blackrock or whatever comes next for them so yeah we were close to that a year and a half ago and the biden administration dispatched boris johnson the briefly prime minister of the uk to stop it and to say to zelensky who i feel sorry for by the way because he's caught between these forces that are bigger than he is to say no you cannot come to any terms with russia and the result of that has not been a ukrainian victory it's just been more dead ukrainians and a lot of profit for the west it's it's a moral crime in my opinion and i tried to ask boris johnson about it because why wouldn't i after he denounced me as a tool of the kremlin or something and he demanded a million dollars to talk to me wow and this just happened last week and and by the way in writing too i'm not making this up i'm not making this up just for the record you demanded a million dollars for me to talk to me today i did and you paid no i'm of course kidding but and i i said to his guy i said i just interviewed putin who was widely recognized as a bad guy and he did it for free he didn't demand a billion dollars he wasn't in this for profit like are you telling me that boris johnson is sleazier than vladimir putin and of course that is the message and so i i guess these are really it's not just about boris johnson being a sad you know rapacious fraud which he is obviously but it's about like the future of the west and the future of ukraine this country that purportedly we care so much about all these people are dying and like what is the end game it's also deranged that i didn't imagine and don't imagine that i could like add anything very meaningful to the conversation because i'm not a genius okay but i felt like i could at the very least puncture some of the lies and that's an inherent good vladimir putin after the interview said that he wasn't fully satisfied because you weren't aggressive enough you didn't ask sharp enough questions uh-huh first of all what do you think about him saying that i don't even understand it i guess it like i it does seem like the one putin statement that western media take at face value everything else putin says is a lie except his criticism of me which is true but i mean i have no idea what he meant by that i can only tell you what my goal was as i've suggested was not to make it about me i i watched you know he hasn't done any any interviews of any kind for years but the last interview he did with an english speaking reporter western media reporter was like many of the other interviews he'd done with western media reporters mike wallace's son did an interview with him that was of the same variety and it was all about him you know i'm a good person you're a bad person and i just feel like that's the most tiresome fruitless kind of interview it's not about me i i don't think i'm an especially good person i've definitely never claimed to be but people can make their own judgments and again the only judgments that i care about are my wife and children and god so i'm just not interested in proving i'm a good person and i just wanna hear from him and and i had a lot of i mean you should see the i i almost never write questions down but i did in this case because i had months well i had three years to think about it as i was trying to book the interview which i did myself but they were all it was all about internal russian politics and navalny and and i had a lot of i thought really good questions and then at the last second and you make these decisions as you know since you interview people a lot often you make them on the fly and i thought no i wanna talk about the the things that haven't been talked about and that i think matter in a world historic sense and then number one among those of course is the war and what it means for the world and so i stuck to that i mean i could answer i did ask about grishkevich who i felt sorry for and i wanted putin to release him to me and i was offended that he didn't i thought his rationale was absurd we wanna trade him for someone i said well that doesn't that make him a hostage you know which of course it does but other than that i really wanted to keep it to the things that i think matter most you know people can judge whether i did a good job or not but that was my that was that was my decision in the moment what was your gut did you wanna ask some tough questions as follow ups on certain topics i don't know what it would mean to ask a tough question clarifying questions i i suppose they would i guess i just wanted him to talk you know i just wanted to hear his perspective again i've probably asked more asshole questions than like any living american you know i'm as as has been noted correctly i'm a dick by my nature and so i don't i i just feel at this stage of my life i didn't need to prove that i could like vladimir putin answered a question sure for sure you know i think if i had been you know thirty four instead of fifty four i definitely would have done that because i would have thought this is really about me and i need to prove myself no i just there's a war going on that is wrecking the us economy in a way and at a scale people do not understand the us dollar is going away that was of course inevitable ultimately because everything dies including currencies but that death that process of death has been accelerated exponentially by the behavior of the biden administration and the us congress particularly the sanctions and peoples don't understand what the ramifications of that are the ramifications are poverty in the united states okay so i just i just wanted to get to that because i'm coming at this from not a global perspective i'm coming at it from an american perspective so you mentioned navalny mhmm after you left navalny died in prison yes what are your thoughts on just at a high level first about his death well it's awful i mean imagine dying in prison you know i've thought about it a lot i've known a lot of people in prison a lot including some very good friends of mine so i felt instantly sad about it from a geopolitical perspective i don't know any more than that and i i laugh at and sort of resent but mostly find amusing the claims by american politicians who really are the dumbest politicians in the world actually you know this happened and here's what it means and it's like actually as a factual matter we don't know what happened we don't know what happened we have no freaking idea what happened we can say and i did say and i will say again i think i don't think you should put opposition figures in prison i really don't i don't period it happens a lot around the world happens in this country as you know and i'm against all of it but do we know how we died short answer no we don't now if i had to guess i would say killing navalny during the munich security conference in the middle of a debate over sixty billion dollars in ukraine funding maybe the russians are dumb i didn't get that vibe at all you know i just don't i don't see it but maybe you know maybe they killed him i mean they certainly put him in prison which i'm against but here's what i do know is that we don't know and so when chuck schumer stands up and joe biden reads some card in front of him with lines about navalny it's like i'm allowed to laugh at that because it's absurd you don't know there's a lot of interesting ideas about if he was killed who killed him yeah because it could be putin it could be somebody in russia who is not putin yep it could be ukrainians because it would benefit the war they killed dugan's daughter in moscow so yeah that's possible and it could be i mean the united states could also be involved i don't think we kill people in other countries to affect election outcomes oh wait no we do it a lot and have for eighty years and it's shameful i can say that as an american because it's my money in my name yeah i'm really offended by that and i never thought that was true and i spent again i'm much older than you and so i spent my my my worldview was defined by the cold war and very much in the house i lived in in georgetown in washington dc you know that's what we talked about and yeah and the left at the time you know i don't know the wacko mit professor who i never had any respect for who i know you've interviewed etcetera like the hard left was always saying well the united states government is interfering in other elections and i just dismissed that completely out of hand as stupid and actually a slander against my country but it turned out to all be true or or substantially true anyway and that's been a real shock for me in middle age to to understand that but anyway as to navalny look i don't know but we should always proceed on the basis of what we do know which is to say on the basis of truth knowable truth and if you have an entire policy making apparatus that is making the biggest decisions on the face of the planet on the basis of things that are bullshit or lies you're gonna get bad outcomes every time every time and that's that's why we are where we are does it bother you that basically the most famous opposition figure in russia is sitting in prison of course it does of course it bothers me i mean it bothered me when i got there it bothers me now i was sad when he died yeah i mean that's one of the measures of it's one of the basic measures of political freedom are you imprisoning people who oppose you you know are you imprisoning people who pose a physical risk to you i mean there's some subjective decision making involved in these things however big picture yeah yeah do you have opposition leaders in jail it's not a free it's not a politically free society and russia isn't obviously and as i said if a friend of mine from childhood an american actually who's a wonderful person lives in russia with his russian moscow with his russian wife and i had dinner with him he's a very balanced guy totally nonpolitical person and and speaks russian and loves his many russian children and and loves the culture and there's a lot to love the culture that produced tolstoy you know it's not a gas station with nuclear weapons sorry only an a moron would say that it's a very deep culture i don't fully understand it of course but i i admire it who wouldn't but i asked him like what's it like living here and he goes it's you know it's great moscow is a great city indisputably he said you don't wanna get involved in russian politics and i said what he said well you could get hurt you could wind up like navalny if you did but also it's just too complicated you know the the russian mind is not is not exactly the same it's it's a western it's a european city but it's not quite european and the way they think is very very complex very complex it's just it's too complicated just don't get involved and i would just say two things one i'm not i mean like i i don't know but my strong sense is that navalny's death whoever did it probably didn't have a lot to do with the the coming election in russia my sense from talking to putin and the people around him is they're not really focused on that i mean in fact i asked one of his top advisers when's the election and she looked at me completely confused she didn't know the date of the election okay she's like march okay and i asked a bunch of other people just in moscow who's who's putin running against like nobody knew so it's not a real election right in the in the sense that we would recognize at all second i was really struck by so many things in moscow and really bothered by deeply bothered by a lot of things that i saw there but one thing i noticed was the total absence of cult of personality propaganda which i expected to see and have seen around the world jordan for example i don't know if you've been to jordan but go to jordan in every building there are pictures of the king and his extended family and and that's a sign of political insecurity you know you don't create a cult of personality unless you're personally insecure and also unless you're worried about losing your grip on power none of that that's it's interesting and i expected to see a lot of it you know like statues of putin no there are no statues of anybody other than like christian saints so that was like i'm not quite sure i'm just reporting what i saw so yes it's not a in a political sense it's not a free country it's not a democracy in the way that we would understand it or want i don't wanna live there okay because i like to say what i think in fact i make my living doing it but it's not stalinist in a recognizable way and anyone who says it is should go there and tell me how i mean this question about the freedom of the press is underlying the very fact of the interview you're having with him right so you might not need to ask the navalny question but did you feel like are there things i shouldn't say i mean how honest do you want me to be i mean it when i say i felt not one twinge of concern for the eight days that i was there maybe i just didn't and i feel like i've got a pretty strong gut sense of things i rely on it i make all my decisions based on how i feel my instincts and i didn't feel it at all my lawyers before i left and these are people who work for a big law firm this is not bob's law firm this is one of the biggest law firms in the world said you're gonna get arrested if you do this by the us government on sanctions violations and i said well i you know i don't i don't recognize the legitimacy of that actually because i'm american and i've lived here my whole life and that's so outrageous that i'm happy to face that that risk because i i so reject the premise okay i'm an american i should be able to talk to anyone i want to and i i plan to exercise that freedom which i think i was born with i gave them this long long lecture they were like we're just lawyers but that was it was it was a let me put it this way i don't know how much you dealt with lawyers but it costs many thousands of dollars to get a conclusion like that like they sent a whole bunch of their summer associates or whatever they sent they put a lot of people on this question checked a lot of precedent and i think and they sent me a ten page memo on it and their sincere conclusion was do not do this and of course it made me mad so i was lecturing on the phone and i had another call with the head lawyer and he said look a lot will depend on the questions that you ask putin mhmm if you're seen as too nice to him you could get arrested when you come back and i was like you're describing a fascist country okay you're saying that the us government will arrest me if i don't ask the questions they wanna ask is that what you're saying well we just think based on what's happened that that's possible and so i'm just telling you what happened so you were okay being arrested in moscow i didn't think i was arrested in i didn't think back then for a second i mean maybe look i don't speak russian i'd never been there before everything about the culture was brand new to me you know ignorance does protect you sort of when you have no freaking idea what's going on you're not worried about it like this has happened to me many times there's a principle there that extends throughout life so it's completely possible that i was in grave peril and didn't know it because like how would i know it you know i'm like a bumbling english speaker from california but i didn't feel it at all but the lawyers did yeah i mean it scared the crap out of people you're gonna and look and i you have to pay in cash they don't take credit cards because of sanctions and you have to go through all these hoops just procedural hoops to go to russia which i was willing to do because i wanted to interview putin because they told me i couldn't but then there's another fact which is that i was being surveilled by the us government intensely surveilled by the us government and this came out they admitted it the nsa admitted it a couple of years ago that they were up in my signal account and then they leaked it to the new york times they did that again before i left and i know that because two new york times reporters one of whom i actually like a lot said oh you're going and called other people oh he's going to interview putin i hadn't told anybody that like anybody like my wife two producers that's it so they got that from the government then i'm over there and of course i wanna see snowden who i admire and so what i have we have a mutual friend so i got his text and come on over and and snowden does not want publicity at all and so but i really wanted to have dinner with him so we had dinner in my hotel room at the four seasons in moscow and i said i tried to convince him you know i'd love to do an interview shoot it on my iphone you know i'd love to take a picture together and put it on the internet because i just wanna show support mhmm because i think he's been railroaded he he had no interest in living in russia no intention of being in russia the whole thing is alive but anyway whatever all this stuff and he just said respectfully i'd rather not anyone know that we met great the only reason i'm telling you this is because and i didn't tell anybody and i didn't text it to anybody okay except him mhmm semaphore semaphore runs this piece saying report reporting information they got from the us intel agencies leaking against me using my money in my name in a supposedly free country they run this piece saying i'd met with snowden like it was a crime or something so again my interest is in the united states and preserving freedoms here the ones that i grew up with and if you have a media establishment that acts as an auxiliary of or acts as employees of the national security state you don't have a free country and that's where we are and i'm not guessing because i spent my entire life in that world thirty three years i worked in big news companies and so i know how it works i know the people involved in it i could name them ben smith of semaphore among many others and i find that really objectionable not just on principle either in effect in practice i don't wanna live in that kind of country and people are like they externalize all of their anxiety about this i have noticed so it's like russia's not free yeah i know you know neither is you know burkina faso like most countries aren't free actually but we are we're the united states we're different and that's my concern preserving that is my concern and so they get so exercised about what's happening in other parts of the world places they've never been know nothing about it's almost a way of ignoring what's happening in their own country right around them i find it so strange and sad and weird so the nsa was tracking you as do you think cia was who's is people still tracking you look one of the things i did before i went just because of the business i'm in all of us are in and just because we live here you know we all have theories about secure communications channels like signal is secure telegraph isn't or whatsapp is owned by mark zuckerberg you can't trust me okay so i thought you know before i go over here i was getting all this we're having all these conversations my producers and i about this and i decide you know i'm just gonna i'm just gonna actually find out like what's really going on so i talked to two people who would know trust me and that's i it's all i can say and i'm i hate to be like oh i talk to people who would know by kentu here but i i mean it mhmm they would know and both of them said exactly the same thing which is are you joking nothing is secure everything is monitored all the time if if state actors were involved i mean you can keep the you know whatever the malaysian mafia from reading your text probably you cannot keep the big intel services from reading your text it's not possible any of them or listening to your calls so and that was the firm conclusion of people who've been involved in it you know for a long time decades both in both cases so i just thought you know what i don't care i don't care i'm not sending a ton of naked pictures of myself to anybody not a ton just a little i'm fifty four dude probably not too many right but but you so i'm like i'm just so the guys travel with three people i work with who i love who i've been around the world with for many years and i know them really really well and they all got you know separate phones and i'm leaving my other phone back in new york or whatever and i just decided i don't care actually and i resent having to no privacy because privacy is a prerequisite for freedom but i can't change it and so i have the same surveilled cell phone and you know i do switch them out because there it is because if you have too much spyware on your phone this is true it wrecks the battery and no i'm serious it does and we got it was i don't know five or six years ago i went to north korea and my phone started acting crazy and so i talked to someone on the national security council who's who actually who called me about this somehow knew that your phone is being surveilled by the south korean government i was like why the i like the south korean government why would they do that because they want more information they thought i was talking to trump or whatever so but i could tell because all of a sudden the thing would just drain in like forty five minutes so that is that's a downside so you you keep switching phones getting new phones for the battery life that's good yeah i mean i try not to do it you know i'm kind of flinty yankee type in some ways so i don't i don't like to spend a thousand dollars with a freaking apple corporation too often but yeah i do i mean you say it lightly but it's really troublesome that he was a journalist would be tracked well they leaked it to semaphore and they leaked it to the new york times look it's i would even put up well there's nothing i can do so i have to put up with everything okay but i would probably not be actively angry about being surveilled because i'm just so old and i'm i actually do pay my taxes i'm not sleeping with a makeup artist or whatever so i don't care that much the fact that they are leaking against me that the intel services in the united states are actively engaged in us politics and media that's so unacceptable that makes democracy impossible there's no defense of that and yet nbc news ken delaney and the rest will defend it and it's like and and not just on nbc news by the way on the supposedly conservative channels too they will defend it and there's no defending that you can't have democracy if the intel services are tampering in elections and information period so you had no fear you know your lawyer said be careful which questions you asked you said i don't have well the lawyer said no he said very specifically if you know depending on the questions you ask putin mhmm you know you could be arrested or not and i said listen to what you're saying you're saying the us government has like control over my questions and they'll arrest me if i ask the wrong question like how are we better than putin if that's true and by the way that's just what the lawyer said but i i can't overstate one of the biggest law firms in the united states smart lawyers we've used for years so i was i was really shocked by it you said leaders kill leaders lie yeah i don't believe in leaders very much like this whole like oh zelensky is jesus and putin's satan it's like no they're all leaders of countries okay like grow up a little bit you child do you have you ever met a leader like all of the first of all anyone who seeks power is damaged morally in my opinion you shouldn't be seeking power you can't seek power or wealth for its own sake and remain a decent person that's just true so there aren't any like really virtuous billionaires and there aren't any really virtuous world leaders you have grades of virtue some are better than others for sure but i mean in other words zelensky may be better than putin i'm open to that possibility but to claim that one is evil and the other is virtuous it's like you're revealing that you're a child you don't know anything about how the world actually is or what reality is like it's it's it's that's quite a realist perspective but there is a spectrum there is a spectrum absolutely i'm not saying they're all the same they're not and our task is to figure out where on the spectrum they they lie in the leaders task is to confuse us and convince us they're one of the good guys of course but i actually reject even that formulation i don't think it's always about the leaders i mean of course the leaders make the difference a good leader has a healthy country and a bad leader has a decaying country which is something to think about but it's about the ideas and the policies and the practical effect of things so we're very much caught up in the personalities of various leaders not just our political leaders but our business leaders our cultural leaders are they good people do they have the right thoughts it's like no i ask a much more basic question what are the fruits of their behavior and i always make it personal because i think everything is personal does his wife respect him do his children respect him how are they doing is the country he runs thriving or is it falling apart if your life expectancy is going down if your suicide rate is going up if your standard of living is tanking you're not a good leader i don't care what you tell me i don't care what you claim you represent i don't care about the ideas or the systems that you say you embody it's it's it's dogs barking to me how's your life expectancy how's your suicide rate what's drug use like are people having children are are people's children more likely to live in a freer more prosperous society than than you did and their grandparents did like those are the only measures that matter to me the rest is a lie but anyway the point is we just get so obsessed with like the the theater around people or people and we miss the bigger things that are happening and we we allow ourselves to be deceived into thinking that what doesn't matter at all matters that moral victories are all that matters no actually facts on the ground victories matter more than anything i mean you certainly see it in this country black lives matter for example how many black people did that help it hurt a lot of black people but in the end we should be able to measure it you know like what how many black people have died by gunfire in the four years since george floyd died well the number's gone way way up and that was a black lives matter operation defund the police so i think we can say as a factual matter data based matter black lives matter didn't help black people and if it did tell me how well these are important moral victories i'm over that that's just another lie you know long litany of lies so i try to see the rest of the world that way and but more than anything i try to see world events through the lens of an american because i am one and what does this mean for us and it's not even the war it's the sanctions that will forever change the united states our standard of living the way our government operates that more than any single thing in my lifetime screwed the united states levying those sanctions in the way that we did was crazy and that was that for me the main takeaway from my eight days in moscow was not putin he's a leader with whatever there are none of them are that different actually in my pretty extensive experience no it was moscow that blew my mind i was not prepared for that at all and i thought i knew a lot about moscow my dad worked there on and off in the eighties and nineties because he was a us government employee and he was always coming back moscow it's a nightmare and all this stuff no electricity i got there almost exactly two years after sanctions mhmm totally cut off from western financial systems kicked out of swift can't use us dollars no banking no credit cards and that city it just factually it's i'm not endorsing the system not endorsing the whole country i didn't go to lake bacal you know i didn't go to turkmenistan i just went to moscow largest city in europe thirteen million people i drove all around it and that city is way nicer outwardly anyway i don't live there than any city we have by a lot and by nicer let me be specific no graffiti no homeless no people using drugs in the street totally tidy no garbage on the ground and no forest of steel and concrete soul destroying buildings none of the postmodern architecture that oppresses us without without even our knowledge none of that crap it's a truly beautiful city and that's not an endorsement of putin and by the way it didn't make me love putin it made me hate my own leaders because i grew up in a country that had cities kind of like that that were nice cities that were safe and i'd we don't have that anymore and how did that happen did putin do that i don't think putin did that actually i think the people in charge of it the mayors the governors the president they did that and they should be held accountable for it so i think cleanliness and architectural design is not the entirety of the metrics that matter when you measure a city they're the main metrics that matter they're the main metrics that matter the main metrics that matter are cleanliness safety and beauty in my opinion and one of the big lies that we are told in our world is that no something you can't measure that has no actual effect on your life matters most bullshit what matters most to say it again beauty safety cleanliness lots of other things matter too a whole bunch of things matter but if i were to put them in order it's not some like theoretical well actually i don't know if you know that the duma has no power it's a okay i get that freedom of speech matters enormously to me they have less freedom of speech in russia than we do in the united states we are superior to them in that way but you can't tell me that living in a city where you know your six year old daughter can walk to the bus stop and ride on a clean bus or ride in a beautiful subway car that's on time and not get assaulted that doesn't matter no that matters almost more than anything actually and we can have both and like the normal regime defenders and morons jon stewart or whatever he's calling himself they're like woah that's the price of freedom like people shitting on the sidewalk is the price of freedom it's like you can't fool me because i've lived here for fifty four years i know that it's not the price of freedom because i lived in a country that was both free and clean and orderly so that's not a trade off i think i have to make you can't that is the beauty of being a little bit older because you're like no i remember that actually it wasn't what you're saying we didn't have racial segregation in nineteen eighty five it was a really nice country that kind of respected itself i was here and i think with younger people you can tell them that and they're like oh nineteen eighty five you were you know selling slaves in madison square garden it's like no you they weren't you're going to madison square garden and not stepping over a single fentanyl addict it is true there doesn't have to be a trade off between cleanliness and freedom of speech but it is also true that in dictatorships cleanliness is and architectural design is easier to achieve and perfect and often is done so so you can show off look how great our cities are while you're suppressing worse of course i agree with that vehemently this is not a defense of the russian system at all and if i felt that way i would not only move there but i would announce i was moving there i'm not ashamed of my views i never have been and for all the people who are trying to impute secret motives to my words i'm like the one person in america you don't need to do that with if you think i'm a racist ask me and i'll tell you are you a racist no i have a sexist though alright okay anyway no but if i was like a defender of vladimir putin i would just say i'm defending vladimir putin now i'm not i am attacking our leaders and i'm grieving over the low expectations of our people you don't need to put up with this you don't need to put up with foreign invaders stealing from you you know occupying your kid's school your kids can't get an education because people from foreign countries broke our laws and showed up here and they've taken over the school that it's that's not a feature of freedom actually that's the opposite that's what enslavement looks like and so i'm just saying raise your expectations a little bit you can have a clean functional safe country crime is totally optional crime is something our leaders decide to have or not have it's not something that just appears organically i wrote a book about crime thirty years ago i i thought a lot about this you have as much crime as you put up with period and it doesn't make you less free to not tolerate murder in fact it makes you unfree to have a lot of murders and so i just but it makes me sad that people are like well you know i guess this is i i can't like live in new york city anymore because of inflation and filth and illegal aliens and people shooting each other but you know i'm just i'm glad because this is vibrant and strong and free it's like that's not freedom actually at all your point is well taken you can have both but do you regret we had both that's the point we had but i saw it do you regret to a degree using the moscow subway and the grocery store as a mechanism by which to make that point no i mean i thought i i mean look i'm one of the more unself aware people you will ever interview so to ask me you know how will this be perceived oh yeah literally i have no idea and kind of limited interest but i i was so shocked by it i was so shocked by it and and there were two and to the extent i regret anything and am to blame for anything it would be not and i've done this a lot not giving it context not fully explaining why are we doing this mhmm the grocery store i was shocked by the prices and yes i'm familiar with exchange rates but very familiar with exchange rates but those don't and i adjusted them for exchange rates and this is two years into sanctions total isolation from the west so i would expect in fact i did expect until i got there that their supply chains would be crushed how do you get good stuff if you don't have access to western markets and i didn't fully get the answer because i was occupied doing other things when i was there but somehow they have and that's the point and they haven't had the supply chains problems that i predicted in other words sanctions haven't made the country noticeably worse okay so again this is commentary in the united states and our policymakers why are we doing this it's forcing the rest of the world into a block against us called brics they're getting off the us dollar that will mean a lot of dollars are gonna come back here and destroy our economy and impoverish this country so the consequences the stakes are really high they're huge and we're not even hurting russia so like what the hell are we doing one on the subway that subway was built by joseph stalin right before the second world war i'm not endorsing stalin i obviously stalin is stalinism is a thing that i hate and i don't want to come to my country i'm making the obvious point that for over eighty years you've had these frescoes and chandeliers maybe they've been redone or whatever but like somehow the society has been able to not destroy what its ancestors built the things that are worth having and they're a lot and that like why don't we have that and e even on a much more terrestrial plane like why can't i have a subway station like that why can't my children who live in new york city ride the subway a lot of people i know who live in new york city are afraid to ride the subway young women especially that's freedom no again it's slavery and how can if putin can do this why can't we like what it's not in other words i mean this is like so obvious i'm a traitor okay so if i'm calling for american citizens to demand more from their government and higher standards for their own society and remember that just thirty years ago we had a much different and much happier and cleaner and healthier society where everyone wasn't fat with diabetes at forty from poisoned food like how is the i'm not a traitor to my country i'm a defender of my country by the way the people calling me a traitor they're all like you know whatever they're not i i would not say they're people who put america's interest first but just put it mildly there's many elements like you said you don't like stalinism you know you're a student of history central planning is good at building subways in a way that's really nice the thing that accounts for new york subways by the way there's a lot of really positive things about new york subways not cleanliness but the efficiency like the accessibility how how wide it spreads like that now the new york network is incredible it is but moscow for different in different under different metrics results of a capitalist system and you actually said that you don't think us is quite a capitalist system which is an interesting question in itself we have more central planning here than they do in russia no that's not true of course it is you think that's true the climate agenda of course they're telling the us government has in league with a couple of big companies decided to change the way we produce and consume energy there's no popular outcry for that there's never been any mass movement of americans who's like i just i hate my gasoline powered engine no more diesel that has been central planning that is central planning and you see it up and down our economy there's no free market in the united states you get crossways with the government you're done if you're at scale i mean maybe if you've got a barber shop or a liquor store or something but even then you're regulated by politicians and so no we i actually am for free markets i hate monopolies our economy is dominated by monopolies completely dominated in what do you mean google what percentage of search does google have ninety google's a monopoly by any definition and google is just rich enough to continue doing whatever it wants in violation of us law so there's no monopoly in russia as big as google i'm not again defending the russian system i'm calling for a return to our old system which was sensible and moderate and put the needs of americans at least somewhere in the top ten i mean somewhere in the top ten i'm not saying that standard oil was like interested in the welfare of average americans but i am saying that there was a constituency in our political system in the congress for example different presidential candidates like no wait a second what is this doing to people is it good for people or not there's not even a conversation about that it's like shut up and submit to ai and no offense and so i'm just offense taken i'm just i'll i'll write i'll we will get you yeah i went strong i have no idea you'll be the first one to go a white man i just won't even exist anymore so so much to say on that one i bet when you google my picture mhmm twenty years from now it'll be a black chick a hundred percent well i hope she's attractive i hope so too it'd probably be an upgrade so well the the central planning point is really interesting but i i just don't i i don't know where you're coming from there's a capitalist system i mean the united states is one of the most successful capitalist system in the history of of earth so it's just what's the most successful i'm just saying that i think it's it's changed a lot in the last fifteen years and that we need to update our assumptions about what we're seeing sure and that's that's true up and down that's true with everything it's true with your neighbor's children who you haven't seen in three years and they come home from wesleyan and you're like oh you've grown that is true for the world around us as well and most of our assumptions about immigration about our economy about our tax system are completely outdated if you compare them to the current reality and so i'm just for updating my files and i have a big advantage over you because i am middle aged and so i don't you've called yourself old so many times throughout this trust my perceptions of things so i'm constantly trying to be like is that true yeah i should go there you know i should see it and i guess just in the end i trust i trust direct perceptions like i don't trust the internet actually wikipedia is a joke wikipedia could not be more dishonest it's certainly in the political categories or things that i know a lot about occasionally i read an entry written about something that i saw or know the people involved and i'm like well that's a complete liar you left out the most important fact and it's like it's not a reliable guide to reality or history and that will accelerate with ai where history or perception of the past is completely controlled and distorted so i think just getting out there and seeing stuff and seeing that moscow was not what i thought it would be which was a smoldering ruin you know rats in a garbage dump it was nicer than new york what the hell direct data is good but it's challenging for example if if you talk to a lot of people in moscow or in russia and you ask them is there censorship they will usually say yes there is oh yeah of course there is well i agree i mean just to be clear i'm not i have no plans to move to russia i think i would probably be arrested if i moved to russia ed snowden who is you know the most famous sort of openness transparency advocate in the world i would say along with assange doesn't wanna live in russia he's had problems with the putin government he's attacked putin they don't like it i mean i get it i get it i'm just saying what are the lessons for us and the main lesson is we are being lied to like in a way that's bewildering and very upsetting i was mad about it all eight days i was there because i feel like i'm better informed than most people because it's my job to be informed and i'm skeptical of everything and yet i was completely hoodwinked by it i i would just recommend to everyone watching this like you think you know like if you're really interested if you're one of those people and i'm not one but it was like waking up every day and you've got a ukrainian flag on your mailbox or whatever your ukrainian lapel pin or like absurd theater but if you like sincerely care about ukraine or russia or whatever why don't you just hop on a plane for eight hundred bucks and go see it okay no that doesn't occur to anyone to do that and i know it it's time consuming and kind of expensive sort of not really but you benefit so much i mean i could bore you for like eight hours and i know you've had this experience where you think you know what something is or you think you know who someone is and then you have direct experience of that place or person and you realize all your preconceptions were totally wrong they were controlled by somebody else like you know for in fact i won't betray confidences but off the air we're talking about somebody and you said i couldn't believe the person was not at all like what i thought mhmm well that's happened to me in the positive direction in the positive direction by the way for me it's almost always in that direction most people i meet and i've had the great privilege of meeting a lot you know a lot of people over all this time they're way better than you think or they're more complicated or or whatever but the point is a direct experience unmediated by liars there's no substitute for that well on that point direct experience in ukraine so i visited ukraine and witnessed a lot of the same things you witnessed in moscow so first of all beautiful architecture yes and this is a country that's really in war so it's not oh for real like for real where most of the men are either volunteering or fighting in the war and there's actual tanks in the streets that are going into your major city of kyiv and still the supply chains are working yes it's a handful of months after the start of the war everything is working the restaurants are amazing the most of the people are able to do some kind of job like like the life goes on cleanliness like you mentioned i love that security like it's incredible like there's the crime went to zero they they gave out guns to everybody the the texas strategy it does work yeah when you witness it you realize okay there's something to these people there's something to this country that they're not as corrupt as you might hear right you hear that russia is corrupt ukraine is corrupt you're you assume it's just all gonna go to shit well so that's been and i haven't been to ukraine and i've certainly tried and they put me on some kill him immediately list so i can't i've tried to interview zelensky he keeps denouncing me i just want an interview with him he won't unfortunately i would love to do it i hope you do i hope i do too but one of the things that bothers me most i'd love to hear that what you just said about kyiv and but i'm not really surprised one of the things that i'm most ashamed of is the bigotry that i felt towards slavic people also toward muslims i'll just be totally honest because i lived through decades of propaganda from nbc news and cnn where i worked you know about this or that group of people and they're horrible or whatever and then you whine and i kind of believed it and i see it now like we can't even put the word russia at wimbledon because it's so offensive what does the tennis player have to do with it did he invade ukraine i don't think he did you know stealing all these business guys' yachts and denouncing those oligarchs like what do they have to do with it you know whatever here here's my point the idea that like a whole group of people is just evil because of their blood i just don't believe that i think it's immoral to think that and i can just tell you my own experience after eight days there i think it's a really interesting culture slavic culture which is shared by the way by russia and ukraine of course they're they're first cousins at the most distant and i i found them really smart and interesting and informed i didn't a lot of what they're saying i don't understand the way their minds work because i'm american but it wasn't a thin culture it's a thick culture you know and i admire that and i wish i could go to ukraine i would go tomorrow so i think after you did the interview with putin you put a clip i think on tcn where like your sort of analysis afterwards yeah it wasn't much of an analysis no but what stood out to me is you were kinda talking shit about putin a little bit like you were criticizing him why wouldn't i it spoke to the thing that you mentioned which is you you weren't afraid now the question i wanna ask is it'd be pretty badass if you went to the supermarket and made the point you were making but also criticize putin right criticize that there is a lack of freedom of speech and freedom of the press and in the supermarket yes oh oh you mean if i also said that well yeah i mean i of course i think that i'm not so i guess part of it is that i'm a little because i have such a low opinion of the commentariat in the united states and the and the news organizations which really do just work for the us government i mean i really see them as i did izvestia and pravda in the eighties like they're just organs of the government and i think they're contemptible and i think the people who work there are contemptible and i say that as someone who knows them really well personally i think they're disgusting that i i'm a little bit cut off kind of from what people are saying about me because i'm not interested but so i try not to be defensive like see i'm not a tool of putin but the idea that i'd be flacking for putin when you know my relatives fought in the revolutionary war like i'm as american as you could be it's like crazy to me and applebaum calls me a traitor to my okay right it's just like so dumb i but no of course they don't have no country has freedom of speech other than us canada doesn't have it great britain definitely doesn't have it france netherlands these are countries i spent a lot of time in and russia certainly doesn't have it so that's why i don't live there i'm just saying our sanctions don't work that's all i was saying and we don't have to live like animals we can live with dignity even the russians can do it that's kind of what i was saying even the russians under vladimir freaking putin can live like this and no it's not a feature of dictatorship that's the most i think discouraging and most dishonest line by people like jon stewart who really are trying to prepare the population for accepting a lot less he is really a tool of the regime in a sinister way always has been like how dare you expect that what are you a stalinist it's like no i'm an american i'm like a decent person i just wanna be able to walk to the grocery store without being murdered is that too much to shut up that you don't believe in freedom it's really dark if you think about it you know so there is a fundamental way which you wanted americans to expect more you don't have to live like this we don't have to live like this you don't have to accept it you don't and everyone's afraid in this country they're gonna shut down by the tech oligarchs or have the fbi show up at their houses or go to jail and people are legit afraid of that in the united states and my feeling is so like show a little courage like what is it worth to you for your grandchildren to live in a free prosperous country it should be worth more than your comfort that's how i feel we should make clear that you know by many measures you look at the world press freedom index you're right us is not at the top norway norway is us is scores seventy one same as gambia really west africa let me just ask hold on hold on a second hold on a second hold on a second now you're making me laugh ukraine is sixty one and russia is thirty five the lower it is the worse close to china at twenty three and north korea at the very bottom twenty two didn't ukraine put gonzalo lira in jail till he died for criticizing the government how can they have a high press yes that's why they're sixty one but i'm saying i don't know because they're i don't know what the criteria are they're using to arrive at that but i know press freedom when i see it i try to practice it which is saying what you think is true correcting yourself when you've been shown to be wrong as i have many times being as honest as you can be all the time and not being afraid and those are wholly absent in my country wholly absent people are afraid in the news business i would know since i spent my life working there and they're afraid to tell the truth they're under enormous amount of pressure and a lot of them have little kids and mortgages i've been there so i have sympathy but they go along with things like you would you are not allowed if you stand up at any cable channel any cable channel in the united states and say wait a second how did the ukrainian government throw a us citizen into prison until he died for criticizing the ukrainian government and we're paying for that that's what's that's why it's offensive to me we're paying for it that happens all the time around the world of course but this is a us citizen and we're paying the pensions of ukrainian bureaucrats like we we are the ukrainian government at this point and like if you said that on tv on any channel well you you know you'd lose your job for that so like that's not i don't care norway is at the top really norway if i went to norwegian television and said nato blew up nord stream which it did nato blew up nord stream the united states government with the help of other governments blew up committed the largest act of industrial terrorism in history and by the way the largest environmental crime the largest emission of c o two methane could i keep my job now so how is that affecting don't know that i mean the whole point of in norway yes well as the scandinavian i can tell you they would not put up with that in norway for a second it's been deviating for the majority no well but in it's deviating maybe is frowned upon but frowned upon yeah but do you have the freedom to say it if you do deviate that's the question can you keep your job that's one measurement of it yeah yeah it's not the only measurement obviously being thrown into prison is much worse than losing your job i've been fired a number of times for saying what i think by the way and it's fine i've enjoyed it i don't mind being fired it's i've always become a better person after it happened but it is one measurement of freedom if you know if you have the theoretical right to do something but no practical ability to do it do you have the right to do it and the answer is not really actually you mentioned jon stewart the two of you have a bit of a history i don't know if you've seen it but he kind of grilled your supermarket and subway videos have you got any chance to see it i haven't seen it but someone characterized it to me which is why i pivoted against it early in our conversation about how the price of freedom is living in filth and chaos yeah that was essentially it so in two thousand four that's twenty years ago jon stewart appeared on crossfire a show he hosted and that was kind of a memorable moment can you tell the saga of that as you remember it i mean for me you know as i was saying to you before about how it takes a long time to digest and process and understand what happens to you or at least it does for me i didn't understand that as a particularly significant moment while it was happening i just got off a plane from hawaii i mean i was out of it as usual and i was very literal as usual and so from my perspective his criticism of me to the extent i remember it was that i was a partisan well he had two one that crossfire was stupid which it certainly was in fact i'd already given my notice and i was moving on to another company by that point crossfire was was stupid crossfire didn't help crossfire framed everything as republican versus democrat whatever it was not helpful to the public discourse i couldn't agree more and that's why i left so that was part of his critique fair i'm not sure i would have admitted it at the time because i worked there and it's sort of hard to admit you're engaged in an enterprise that's like fundamentally worthless which it was but but his other point was that i was somehow a partisan or a mindless partisan which is definitely not true it is true of him he is a mindless partisan but i am not and i haven't been for i really haven't been since i got back from baghdad at the beginning of the iraq war and i realized that the republican party which i'd voted for you know my whole life to that point and had supported in general was like pushing this really horrible thing that was gonna hurt the united states which in time it it really did the iraq war really hurt the united states and i realized that i had been on the wrong side of that i said so publicly immediately from baghdad i said that to the new york times and i really meant it i mean it now and so to call me partisan you could call me stupid you could call me wrong i certainly have been wrong but partisan well i just didn't think it was a meaningful i mean it's like that's just not true it's the opposite of true so i didn't really take it seriously at all and i and i never thought much of him so i was like whatever some buffoon jumping around on my show grandstanding but i do think it was record and by the way that happened right at the moment that youtube began i think that was one of the first big youtube it was one of the first big youtube videos so it it had a virality that if that's a word it went everywhere in a way that didn't used to happen in cable cable news i mean by that point i had that was twenty years ago as you point out i've been in cable news for nine years so in the before two thousand four we would say something on television and then it would kind of it would be lost like people could claim they heard it but you'd have to go to the i think the university of tennessee at knoxville archives to get it suddenly everything we said would live forever on the internet which is good by the way that's not bad but it was a big change for me and i just couldn't believe how widely that was discussed at the time because i thought he was not a an interesting person i think he's he's obviously a very unhappy person i just didn't take him seriously then and i and i don't now but so anyway that was it it was a smaller thing in my life at the time than other people imagine okay you said a lot of words that will make it sound like you're a bit bitter even if you're not so you you said unhappy person well i partisan person happy guy well he's definitely partisan for sure can you elaborate why you think he's well so i think that and i see this a lot not only on the left but people who believe that whatever political debate they're engaged in is the most important debate in the world and so they bring an emotional intensity to those debates and they're inevitably disappointed because no no eternal question is solved politically so they're kind of on the wrong path right and they're doomed to frustration if they believe that and many do he certainly does that whatever the issue is so you know clarence thomas stop being supreme court justice and the implication is well if someone else's supreme court justice will live in a fair and happy society but that's just not it's a false promise so i think that people who bring that level of intensity to politics are by definition bitter by definition disappointed bitter in the way the disappointed people are and that the real questions are like what happens when you die and how do the people around you feel about you you know those are those are not the only questions in life but they're certainly the most important ones and if we're spending a disproportionate amount of time on who gets elected to some office not that it's irrelevant it is relevant but it's not the eternal question and so i feel like he's not the only kind of bitter silly person in washington or in its in its orbit there are many and a lot of them are republicans so but i just thought it was ironic i mean everything's ironic to me but like being called a russia sympathizer by a guy who calls himself boris you know like it just made me laugh no one else has ever laughed at that boris johnson's real name is not boris as you know he calls himself boris it's his middle name and so like if you call yourself boris you don't really have standing to attack anyone else as a russia defender right that's my i think that's funny no one else as i noted does but but jon stewart like yeah you know if if he there are a lot of things you could say about me but he's much more partisan than i am so to call me a partisan is like what he would probably say that he's not a partisan that he's a comedian who's looking for the humor and the absurdity of the system that's a dumb both sides he's a dead seer he's a very serious person in this i will say this and he shares this quality with a lot of comedians i know a lot of comedians i know a cross section of people just having done this job for a long time and a lot of them are very serious like about their views and they're they have a lot of emotional intensity and he certainly is in that category he's not that's that's like the silliest thing yeah he's a comedian for sure he can be very funny for sure he has talent no doubt about it i've never denied that but he is a he's motivated by by his moral views you know this is right that is wrong and and i just think that's it's a misapplied passion but do you think i'm just a comedian is i don't think any serious person thinks that i mean if you're just a comedian be and and i look i'm i'm not trying to claim i couldn't claim but but i haven't said a lot of dumb things and one of the dumbest things i ever said was when he was on our set lecturing me you know he's he's a moralizer which i also just don't really care for as an aesthetic matter but he he was lecturing me about something and i said i thought you're here to tell jokes which i shouldn't have said because he wasn't there to tell jokes he was there to to lecture me and i should've just engaged it directly rather than trying to diminish him by like you're just a little comedian well he doesn't see himself that way but i would just say this jon stewart's a defender of power like john stewart has never criticized like what's john stewart's view on you know the aid we've sent to ukraine the hundred billion dollars or whatever like what happened to that money what happened to the weapons that i bought he doesn't care he has the exact same priorities as the people permanently in charge in washington so whatever he does he's not alone in that so does mika brzezinski and her husband and all the rest of the the cast of dummies but if you're gonna pretend to be the guy who's giving the finger to entrenched power you should do it once in a while and he never has there's not one time when he said something that would be deeply unpopular on morning joe that's all i'm saying and so don't call yourself a truth teller you're you're a court comedian or a a flatterer of power okay that's fine there's a role for that but don't pretend to be something else i'll just be honest that i watched it just recently that video and i from twenty years ago from twenty years ago i watched it initially and i remember very differently i remembered that jon stewart completely destroyed you in that conversation and i watched it and you asked a very good question of him which was and you there was no destruction first of all and you asked a very good question of him why when you got a chance to interview john kerry did you ask a bunch of softball questions yeah i thought that was a really fair question and then his defense was well i'm just a comedian so i thought that was disingenuous and i haven't watched it i never have watched that clip one time in my life and i don't like to watch myself on television i never have so that and that's my fault and i probably should force myself to watch it though of course i never will but i i think the takeaway for me which was really interesting and life changing was i agree with your assessment i'm not just i've lost a lot of debates i've been humiliated on television i'm not above that it certainly happened to me it will happen again but i didn't feel like it was a clear win for him at all you know maybe a tko but it was not a knockout at all and yet it was recorded that way and i remember thinking well that's kinda weird that's not what i remember and then i realized no jon stewart was more popular than i was therefore he was recorded as the winner and that was hard for me to accept because that struck me as unfair you should rate any contest on points like here are the rules we're gonna judge the contest on the basis of those rules and now in the end it's just like the more popular guy wins every tv critic like jon stewart everyone hated me therefore he won and i was like wow that i guess i have to accept that reality and you do like the reality of the sunrise you just have you know you're not in charge of it so that's just what it is unfortunately it's a bit darker i think the reason he's seen as the winner and the reason at the time i saw as the quote unquote winner is because he was basically shitting on you like personal attacks versus engaging ideas and it was it was funny in a dark way and like making fun of the bow tie and all this kind of stuff so i'm like hair on bow ties i understand and it was weird to call me a dick i remember he called me a dick and i remember even when he said that i was like yeah i'm definitely a dick yeah and that's not my best quality trust me i think but also to be kinda i thought john stewart came off as a giant dick at that time and i'm a big fan of his and i think he has improved a lot so that makes it true i we we should also say that like people grow people like oh i certainly have or change anyway you hope it's growth you hope it's not shrinkage but but it is too outside yeah i i mean look i i i haven't followed jon stewart's career at all i don't have a television like i'm pretty cut off from all that stuff but so i wouldn't really know but the measure to me is are you taking positions that are unpopular with the most powerful people in the world and how often are you doing it it's super simple not for its own sake but do you feel free enough to say you know to the consensus i disagree and if you don't then you're just another toady that's my view well i think he probably feels free enough to do it but you're saying he doesn't do it on the big things look the big things this is my estimation of it others may disagree the big things are the economy and war okay yeah the big things government does can be i mean a lot of things government does government does everything at this point but where we kill people and how and for what purpose and how we organize the economic engine that keeps the country afloat those are the two big questions and i hear almost no debate debate about either one of them in the media and i've and i have dissenting views on both of them i mean i'm i'm mad about the tax code which i think is unfair i don't think we should be the fact we've carried interest loophole in the tax code and people are claiming that their income is investment income and they're paying half the tax rate as someone who just goes to work every day it discourages work it encourages lending at interest which i think is gross personally i'm against it sorry and and the fact that we're creating chaos around the world like is the saddest thing that's happening right now and nobody feels free to say that so that's not good how do you hope the war in ukraine ends with a settlement with a reasonable settlement and you know what a reasonable settlement is which is a settlement you know where both sides feel like they're giving a little but can live with it and i i mean i was really struck in my conversation with putin by how he basically refused to criticize joe biden and to criticize nato and it is i will just be honest as an american it would be a little weird to be like pissing on joe biden with a foreign leader any foreign leader even though i don't think joe biden is a real person or really president i mean the whole thing is ridiculous but still he is the american president technically and i don't want to beat up on the american president with a foreigner just don't maybe i'm old fashioned so that's how i feel so i didn't push it but i thought it was really interesting and because of course putin knows my views on joe biden he knew i applied to the cia so they've done some done some digging on me and but he didn't mention it and he didn't attack nato and the reason is i know for a fact because he wants a settlement and he wants a settlement not because russia's about to collapse despite the lying of our media that's just not true and no one is even saying it anymore because it's so dumb he wants to because it's just it's just bad to have a war and it changes the world in ways you can't predict people die everything about it is sad and if you can avoid it you should so i would like to see a settlement where look the thing that russia wants and i think probably has a right to is not to have nato missiles on this border like i don't know why we would do that i don't know what we get out of it i i just don't even understand it i don't understand the purpose of nato i i don't think nato was good for the united states i think it's an attack on our sovereignty i would pull out of nato immediately if i were the us president because i don't think it helps the us i know a lot of people are getting their bread buttered by nato but i anyway that's my view as an american as if if i'm a russian or a ukrainian let's just let's just be sovereign countries now we're not run by the us state department we're just our own countries like that's i believe in sovereignty okay so that's my view and i also wanna say one thing about zelensky i i attacked him before because i was so offended by his cavalier talk about nuclear exchange because he it would kill my family so i'm really offended by that anyone who talks that way i'm offended by but i do feel for zelensky i do that he didn't he didn't run for president to have this happen i think zelensky has been completely misused by the state department by toria nuland by our secretary of state by the policymakers in the us who've used ukraine as a vessel for their ambitions their geopolitical ambitions but also the many american businesses who've used ukraine as a way to fleece the american taxpayer and then by just independent ghouls like boris johnson are hoping to get rich from interviews on it like the whole thing zelensky is at the center of this he's not driving history nato and the united states is driving history putin is driving history there's this guy zelensky so you know i i do feel for him and i think he's in a perilous place do you think zelensky is a hero for staying in kyiv because i do to me you can criticize a lot of things you should call out things that are obviously positive i i just tried to a second ago i don't i don't know the extent that he is in kyiv he seems to be in the united states an awful lot like way too much you can do a satellite interview you don't have to speak to my congress you're not an american please leave yeah that's my opinion but you got many zingers tucker no no no it's just heartfelt it's bubbling up from the wellspring that never turns off but i would say this about zelensky yeah to the extent he's in ukraine good man you know george w bush fled washington on nine eleven i lived there with three kids and he ran away to some air force base in south dakota and i thought that was cowardly and i said so at the time and i'm man was i attacked for saying that and i wrote a column about it in new york magazine where i then had a column hard to believe and but i felt that i felt that like that's i think the prerequisites of leadership are really basic the first is caring about the people you lead that's number one you know deep in the way a father cares for his children or an officer cares for his troops a president should care for his people and and that leads inexorably to the next requirement which is bravery physical courage and i believe in that and i'm not like some tough guy but i just think it's obvious if you're in charge you you know i'm at my house and i feel like someone broke in i'm not gonna say to my wife hey baby go go deal with the home invasion i'm a deal with it because i'm dad okay so if you're the president of a country and your capital city is attacked as ours was at the pentagon and you run away well the secret service told me to bitch are you in charge like who's daddy here the secret service do do you know what i mean i found that totally contemptible and i said so and man did i get a lecture not just from republicans but from democrats oh you don't know put yourself in that position i was like okay i don't know what i would do under that kind of stress enormous stress i get it i know one thing i wouldn't do is run away because you can't do that and if you're not willing to die for your country then you shouldn't be leading it so yes to the extent if if zelensky really is in ukraine most of the time amen wait hold on a second let's clarify it's not about what day he's in ukraine most of the time or not i thought that was the whole premise of the no no no no at the at the beginning of the war when the tank when kiev when a lot of people thought that the second biggest military in the world is pointing its guns in kiev is gonna be taken and a man a leader who stays in that city says fuck it when everybody around him says flee says everybody around him believes the city will be taken or at least destroyed you know leveled artillery bombs all of this he chooses to stay you know a lot of leaders how many leaders would choose to stay well the leader of afghanistan the us backed leader when the taliban came got in a us plane with us dollars and and ran away and and of course is living on those dollars now so yeah there's a lot of cowardly behavior good for him i i mean i guess i'm looking at it slightly differently which is what's the op what's the option you're the leader of the country you can't leave like stalin never left moscow during the war it was surrounded by the germans as you know for a year and he didn't leave and when i was in russia they're like stalin never left it's like how is the leader of the country you can't i mean like that's just table stakes of course i would say but you raised an interesting by implication question which is you know what about kyiv like you think the russians couldn't level kyiv of course obviously they could why haven't they they could but they haven't well there's there's military answers to that which is urban warfare is extremely difficult do you think that putin wants to take kyiv no i do think he expected zelensky to flee and and somebody else to come into power yeah that may be total i i don't i don't know i don't think i have no idea what putin was thinking when he did that about zelensky i didn't ask him but it's a mistake to imagine this is a contest between putin and zelensky this is putin versus the us state department i mean zelensky that and that's why i said i felt sorry for him i mean as i said we're literally paying the pensions of ukrainian bureaucrats so there is no ukrainian government independent of the us government and you know maybe you're for that maybe you're against it but you can't endorse that in the same sentence that you use the term democracy because that's not a democracy right obviously well that's why it's interesting that he didn't really bring up nato extensively he wants a settlement he wants a settlement and he doesn't wanna fight with them rhetorically and he just wants to get this done and he made a bunch of offers at the peace deal and you know we wouldn't even know this happened if the israelis hadn't told us and i'm so grateful that they did that johnson was dispatched by the state department to stop it and it's like i i mean i think boris johnson is a husk of a man but imagine if you're boris johnson and you you know you spend your whole life with ukraine flagphet i'm for ukraine and then all those kids died because of what you did and the lines haven't really moved it hasn't been a victory for ukraine it's not gonna be a victory for ukraine it's like how do you how do you feel about yourself if you did that i mean i've done a lot of shitty things in my life i i feel bad about them but i've never extended a war for no reason like that's a pretty grave sin in my opinion you know yes that was a failure but it doesn't mean you can't have a success over and over and over keep having negotiations between leaders well we're not the us government is not allowing negotiations and so that for me is the most upsetting part it's like in the end what russia does i'm not implicated in that what ukraine does i'm not implicated in that i'm not russian or ukraine i'm an american who grew up really believing in my country i'm supporting my country through my tax dollars and it's like i really care about what the us government does because they're doing it in my name and i care a lot because i'm american and we're the impediment to peace which is another way of saying we're responsible for all these innocent people getting dragooned out of public parks in kiev and sent to go die like what that is not good i'm ashamed of it what do you think of putin saying that justification for continuing the war is denazification i thought it was one of the dumbest things i've ever heard i didn't understand what it meant denazification it literally means what it sounds like you know i yeah i mean i have a lot of thoughts on this i don't i hate that whole conversation because it's it's not real it's just ad hominem it's a way of associating someone with an evil regime that doesn't exist anymore but in point of fact nazism whatever it was is inseparable from the german nation it was a nationalist movement in germany there were no other nazis right there's no book of nazism like i wanna be a nazi what is it what does it mean to be a nazi there's no idea there's no mein kampf i mean there's no mein kampf is not das kapital right mein kampf is like to the extent i understand it it's like he's pissed about the treaty of versailles whatever i'm very anti nazi i'm merely saying there isn't a nazi movement in twenty twenty four it's a way of calling people evil okay putin doesn't like nationalist ukrainians putin hates nationalism in general which is interesting but of course he does he's got eighty whatever republics and he's afraid of nationalist movements he fought a war in chechnya over this so i understand it but i have a different i'm for national i'm for american nationalism so like i disagree with putin on that but calling them nazis it's like i thought it was childish well i i do believe that he believes it so that's so inter i agree with that i was because i was listening to this because in the united states everyone's always calling everyone else a nazi you're a nazi okay but i was listening to this and i was like this is the dumbest sort of not convincing line you could take and i sat there and listened to him talk about nazis for like eight minutes and i'm like i think he believes this yeah and i actually you know having had a bunch of conversations with people who are living in russia they they also believe it now there's technicalities here which the word nazi the world war two is deeply in the blood of a lot of russians in ukraine ukraine i get it i get it so you're using it as almost a political term yes the way it's used in united states also like racism and all this kind of stuff because you know you can really touch people if you use the nazi that's totally right but it's also to me a really like disgusting thing to do i agree because and also to clarify there is neo nazi movements in ukraine they're they're just they're very small you're saying that there's this distinction between nazi and neo nazi sure but it's a small percentage of the population a tiny percentage they have no power in government as far i have seen no data to show they have any influence on zelensky and the zelensky government at all so really when putin says denazification i think he means nationalist movements i think i think you're right and i i agree with everything you said and i do think that the war the second world war occupies a place in slavic society polish society you know central eastern europe that it does not occupy in the united states and you can just look at the the death totals you know tens of millions versus less than half a million so it's like this eliminated a lot of the male population of these countries so of course it's it's still resonant in those countries i get it i just i think i've watched i don't think i know i've watched the misuse misuse of words the weaponization of words for political reasons for so long that i just i just don't like and though i do engage in it sometime i'm sorry i don't like just dismissing people in a word oh he's a nazi he's a liberal or whatever it's like tell me what you mean what don't you like about what they're doing or saying and and nazi especially i don't even know what the hell you're talking about what troubled me about that is because he said that that's the primary objective currently for the war and that because it's not grounded in reality it makes it difficult to then negotiate peace because like what what does it mean to get rid of the nazis in ukraine so like he'll come to the table and say well okay i will agree to do ceasefire once the nazis are gone okay so can you list the nazis agree plus can you negotiate with the nazi right exactly good good good good no i totally agree with you it was very strange but maybe it's it was perhaps had to do with speaking to his own population and also probably trying to avoid the use of the word nato as the justification of the word yes that's all i i of course i i don't know but i suspect you're right on both counts but i would say it points to something that i've thought more and more since i did that interview which was like two weeks ago i guess it would i didn't think he was like as a pr guy not very good like he's not good at telling his own story you know the story of the current war in ukraine is the eastward expansion of nato scaring the shit out of the russians with nato expansion which is totally necessary it doesn't help the united states nato itself doesn't help the united states and so i'm not pro russian for saying that i'm pro american for saying that and i think that's a really compelling story because it's true he did not tell that story he told some other story that i didn't fully understand again i'm not russian he's speaking to multiple audiences around the world i'm not sure what he hoped to achieve by that interview i will never know but i did think that like this guy is not good at telling his story and i also think honestly on the basis of a lot i mean i know this very isolated during covid very we keep hearing that he's dying of this or that disease he's got als i mean i don't know i'm not his doctor there's a ton of lying about it i know that but one thing that's not a lie is that he was cloistered away during covid i know this and only dealing with two or three people and that makes you weird it's so important to deal with a lot of people to have your views challenged and you see this with leaders who stay empowered too long he's been empowered twenty four years effectively he's done it you know there have been upsides i think for russia the russian economy worse life expectancy but there are definitely downsides and one of them is you get weird and you get autocratic the you know like this is why we have turmoil it's very few kings don't get crazy in old age yeah and you said some of this also in your whilst in your post kremlin discussion while you're in moscow still which was very impressive to me that you can just openly criticize this is great well i don't care i understand this i just wish you did some more of that also with the supermarket video and perhaps some more of that with putin in front of you but i putin in front of me i mean you're right i'm such a good person i i know you see it as virtue signaling yeah it is have you seen some of the the interview he did with some nbc news trial i understand so i think you're just so annoyed by how bad journalists are that you just didn't wanna be them yeah that's probably right actually some some great conversations will involve some challenging like you were confused about denazification well first of all i accept your criticism and i accept it as true that in some way i'm probably pivoting against what i dislike and i have such contempt for american journalist on the basis of so much knowledge that i probably was like i don't wanna be like that fair that is a kind of defensiveness and dumb so you're right as for the nazi thing i was like i really felt like we were just speaking so far past each other that we would never like come to i was like i don't even know what the hell you're talking about and i that and especially when i decided or concluded that he really meant it i was like that's just too freaking weird to me it's it's almost like yeah i can think of many other examples where you're interviewing someone they'll say something that's like i was interviewing a guy one time and he started talking about the black israelites and we're the real jews and i was like you know and it wasn't on camera but i was like i don't that was so it was so far out to me that i was like we'll never kind of understand common terms on that so you mentioned there's a bunch of conspiracy theories about putin's health how is he in person like what did he feel like did he look healthy you know i'm not a health person myself so i mean i can easily gain thirty pounds and not know it so like i'm probably not a great person to ask but no he seemed fine he seemed he had his arm hooked through a chair and i heard people say oh he's got parkinson's and parkinson's can be controlled i know for periods with drugs so it's it's it's hard to assess i'm just not one of the tells of parkinson's is his gait you know how a person walks i think and his walking seemed fine i walked around with him and talked to him off camera his he's had some work done for sure he's seventy one or two me like for visual purposes yeah i'm fifty four he's like almost twenty years older than me he looked younger than me what was that like the conversation off camera like you walking around with him what was the what was the content of the conversation i mean i can't i can't you know i feel bad even with putin or anybody like talking about stuff that is off the record but i'll just say that when i said that he didn't wanna fight with nato or with the us state department or with joe biden because he wants a settlement that's a very informed you know perspective he doesn't you know say whatever you want about that believe it or not but that is true so so he's open for peace open for peace and peace shape russia tried to join nato in two thousand that's a that's a fact okay they tried to join nato so just think about this nato exists to keep russia contained mhmm it exists as a bulwark against russian territorial expansion and whether or not russia has any territorial ambitions is another question like why would it it's the largest land mass in the world whatever but that's why it exists so if russia seeks to join nato it is by definition a sign that nato's job is done here we can declare victory and go home the fact that they turned him down is like so shocking to me but it's true then he approaches the next president george w bush that was with bill clinton at the end of his term in two thousand he approaches the next president and said let's in our next missile deal let's align on this and we'll designate iran as our common enemy iran which is now you know effectively linked with russia thanks to our insane policies but and and george w bush to his credit is like well that seems like kind of an innovative good idea and condi rice who's like one of the stupidest people ever to hold power in the united states if i can say who's like monomaniacally anti russia first because she had an adviser at stanford who was or something during the cold war no we can't do that and bush is just weak and so he agreed it's like what that is crazy if you're fighting with someone and the person says you know what actually our interests align and you've spent eighty percent of your mental disc space on hating me and opposing me or whatever but actually we can be on the same team if you don't at least see that as progress like what why would you if if your interest is in helping your country what would be the what's the counterargument i don't even understand it and no one has even addressed any of this the war of russian aggression yeah it was a war of russian aggression for sure but how did how did we get there we got there because joe biden and tony blinken dispatched kamala harris who does not freelance this stuff okay fair to say to the munich security conference two years ago this month february twenty twenty two and said in a press conference to zelensky poor zelensky we want you to join nato this was not in a backroom this was in public at a press conference knowing because he said it like four thousand times we don't want nuclear weapons from the united states or nato on our western border duh and days later he invaded so like what is that and if you even i raised that question in my previous job and i was denounced as you know of course a trader or something but okay great i'm a trader what's the answer what's the answer these are not into you know toria nuland who i know not dumb hasn't helped the us in any way an architect of the iraq war architect of this disaster one of the people who destroyed the us dollar okay fine but she's not stupid so like you're trying to get a war by acting that way what's the other explanation by the way nato didn't want ukraine because it didn't meet the criteria so for admission so why would you say that because you want a war that's why and that war has enriched a lot of people to the tune of billions so i don't care if i sound like some kind of left wing conspiracy nut because i'm neither left wing nor conspiracy nut tell me how i'm wrong who do you think is behind it if you were to analyze like zoom out looking at the entirety of human history the military industrial complex you said kamala harris is it individuals is it like this collective flock that people are just pro war as a collective it's the hive mind it's and and i you know spent my whole life in dc from eighty five to twenty twenty so thirty five years and again i grew up around it in that world and i do think that conspiracies of course there are conspiracies but in general the hive mind is responsible for the worst decisions it's a bunch people with the same views totally you know views that have not been updated in decades putin said something that i thought was true absolutely true i don't know how he would know this but it is true because i lived among them so the soviet union dissolves in august of ninety one on my honeymoon in bermuda we'll never forget it and it was a big thing you know if you lived in dc i mean the receptionist in my office in nineteen ninety one was getting a master's in russian from georgetown he was gonna be a sovietologist and he was among you know thousands of people in washington on that same track and so the soviet union collapses well so does the rationale for like you know a good portion of the us government has been dedicated for over forty years to opposing this thing that no longer exists so there's a lot of forward momentum there's a huge amount of money the bulk of the money in the richest country in the world aimed in this direction and it's very hard for people to to readjust to reassess it's and you see this in life all the time you know i i you know i love my wife all of a sudden she ran off with my best friend holy shit i didn't expect that this morning now it's a reality like how do i deal with that well you know i i got stage four cancer diagnosis k and it's it's all bad but i'm just saying like that's the nature of life things you did not anticipate never thought you'd have to face happen out of nowhere and you have to adjust your expectations and your goals and people have a hard time with that very hard time with that so that's a lot of it you know people if you're condi rice sort of like highly ambitious midwitt who gets this degree from stanford and you read tolstoy in the original sure you did and and you spent your whole life like thinking that russia is the center of evil in the world it's kinda hard to be like well actually there's a new threat and it's coming from farther east it's primarily an economic threat and maybe all the threats aren't reduced to tank battles that's the other thing is these people are so inelastic in their thinking so lacking imagination and flexibility that they can't sort of imagine like a new framework and the new framework is not that you're gonna go to war with china over formosa taiwan no the the framework is that all of a sudden all the infrastructure in tijuana is gonna be built by china and like that's a different kind of threat but they can't kind of get there because they're not that impressive so you actually have mentioned this it's not just the cold war it's world war two that populates most of their thinking in washington you mentioned churchill chamberlain and hitler and they kind of seeing the world war two as the kind of the good war and the successful role the united states played in that war they're kinda seeing that dynamic that geopolitical dynamic and applying it everywhere else still yeah it's a template for everything and i think it's of huge significance to the development of the west to the civilization we live in now to world history was a world war and so i think it's worth knowing a lot about and being honest about and and all the rest but it's hardly the sum total of human history yeah it's a it's a snapshot and and so you keep hearing people refer to not even the war no one ever talks about the war like what how how much does tony blinken know about the battle of stalingrad probably zero doesn't know anything largest battle in human history but i mean he knows nothing but he knows a lot about the cliches surrounding the thirty eight to forty period nineteen thirty eight to nineteen forty and everything is kind of expressed through that that that formula and and not everything is that formula that's all i'm saying and the republicans have a strange weakness for it particularly the closeted ones the weird the weird ones who were like have no life other than like starting more wars everything to them the most vulnerable i would say among them emotionally psychologically vulnerable the dumbest they will always say the same thing and it appeals to republican voters unfortunately that every problem is the result of weakness everyone's chamberlain like germany never would have gone in to poland czechoslovakia if england had been stronger that's the argument is that true i don't i don't know actually maybe it might be totally true it might not be true at all i really don't know but not everything is that that's not always true if i go up to you in a bar and i say i hate your necktie i'm being pretty aggressive with you pretty strong you might beat the shit out of me actually or shoot me if i do that like an aggressive posture doesn't always get you the outcome that you want sometimes it requires a more sophisticated mediterranean posture i mean it kind of depends it's a time and place thing thing and they don't acknowledge that it's like everything is this same template and i just that's not the road to good decision making at all since we're on the time period let me ask you a kinda almost cliche question but it applies to you mhmm which you've interviewed a lot of world leaders yep if you had the chance to interview hitler in thirty nine forty forty one first of all would you do it and how would you do it i assume you would do it given who you are man it would be a massive cost for doing it it may destroy my life to interview putin though i can tell you as as much as i want that i'm not a putin defender i only care about the united states that's a hundred percent true anyone who knows me will tell you it's true i keep saying it but history may record me to the extent it records me at all as a tool of putin a hater of america you know that seems absurd to me but absurd things happen what would i ask hitler i don't even know i i i guess that i'd probably ask him what i asked putin which is what i ask everybody like what's your motive why did you do i mean if he'd already gone into poland like why are you doing that you know what's your goal and then you know the question is is he gonna answer honestly i don't know you know it's you can't you can't make someone answer a question honestly you can only sort of shut up while they talk and then let people decide what they think of the answer well just like in the bar fight there's different ways you could there are different ways that's exactly right that's exactly man is that true that is absolutely right i mean your energy with with putin for example was such that it felt like he could trust you i felt like he could tell you a lot i think i just wanted i just wanted to get it on the record yes that's all i wanted you know i i think it was extremely like we have to acknowledge how important that interview was for the record and for opening the door for conversation like opening the door to conversation literally is the path to like more conversations and peace peace talks well i would flip it around and say anyone who seeks to shut that down by focusing on a supermarket video of four minutes versus a two hour and fifteen minute long interview with a world leader anyone who doesn't want more conversation who wants fewer facts fewer perspectives is totalitarian and probably doesn't have good intent i mean i i i i can honestly say for all my many manifold faults i've never tried to like make people shut up you know i just it's not in me i don't believe in that so putin's folks have shown interest for quite a while to speaking with me so you've spoken with him what advice would you give oh do it do it immediately how's your russian by the way have you kept up with it yeah fluent so it would most likely be in russian oh so like that that's the other thing is i i do have a question about language barrier like did you feel it was annoying it's horrible yeah it's horrible i mean i don't have much of a technique as an interviewer other than listen really carefully that's that's my only skill i don't have the best questions i certainly don't have the best questions all i do that i'm proud of and i think works is i just listen super carefully i never let a word go by that i'm not paying attention it exhausts me actually but you can't do that in a foreign language because there's a delay here i'm just whining but it's it's real well it's not it's not not whining like can you actually describe the technical details of that are you hearing concurrently like at the same time yes but there's a massive lag so what's happening is so the translator so we were of course extremely uptight about the logistical details so we brought our own cameraman who i've been around the world with who worked at fox came with me now amazing and he did i mean it was our cameras lighting everything like we had full control of that and we had control of the tape the russians also had their own cameras and i don't know what they did with it but we had full control of that and we brought our own translator we got our own translator because i just don't trust anyone right so so i think we had a good translator we had two of them actually and but the because they get exhausted but the problem is from my perspective as someone who's like trying to think of a follow-up and listen to the answer putin will talk and you can in part of your ear hear you know the slavic sounds and then then over that is a guy with a slavic accent speaking english and then you can hear putin stop talking and then this guy's answer goes on for another fifteen twenty seconds so it's super disconcerting and it's really hard and the other thing is it doesn't matter how good your translators are i'm i'm interested in language i speak only english fluently and but i'm really interested in language and i know and i work in language you it doesn't matter how good your translator is in literature and in conversation you miss so much if the language is moving for you i mean you see this in in bible study you see it in in dostoevsky you see it everywhere if you don't speak you know aramaic hebrew russian you're not really getting i mean even in romance languages like i you know i like balzac okay i like who's obviously written french you read pere goryeau it's an amazing novel hilarious and it's like you're not really getting it and it's not that you know french and english are not that far apart mhmm russian like what plus conversation so the chemistry of conversation the humor the wit the the play with words all this stuff exactly and my understanding of russian as a lover of russian literature in english is that it's it's not a simple language at all the grammar's complex mhmm there's a lot that's expressed that will be lost in the translation so yes i mean you the fact that you speak native russian i mean i would run that walk to that interview because i think it would just be amazing you would get so much more out of it than i did and we should say that you've met a lot of world leaders both zelensky and putin are intelligent witty even funny yes so like there's a depth to the person that can be explored through a conversation just on that element the linguistic element putin speaks decent english i spoke to him in english so i know that but he's not comfortable with it at all but zelensky is i think no he is well he's better than putin at english but he's still the humor the like the intelligence all of that is not quite there in english he says simple points but the guy is a comedian and he's a comedian primarily in russian the russian language so the the ukrainian language is now used mostly primarily as a kind of symbol i i'm aware of that it's a political decision no i know and he is you know his really his native language is russian language of course as a lot of people but you you can also understand his position that he might not want to be speaking russian publicly that's something i've i don't think they're allowed to speak in russian in some places in ukraine right that's that's one of the reasons that russia was so mad is that they were attacking language and that's a fair complaint like what and by the way if you haven't been to moscow in a while you should see it and you will pick up a million things that were invisible to me and you should assess it for yourself and my strong advice would be even if you don't interview putin go over there spend a week there and assess what you think i mean how restricted does the society feel i mean it would take a lot of balls to do this because you'll i mean whatever you decide you will be sucked into conversations that have nothing to do with you political conversations yeah you're obviously not a political activist right you're an interviewer but i think it would be so interesting but for interview itself is there advice you have about how to carry interview it is fundamentally different when you do it in the native language but yes i mean i think you know i approached the and maybe i did it incorrectly but this was the product of a lot of thought i was coming into that interview aware that he hadn't given an interview at all with anybody since the war started mhmm so i had a million different questions and as noted i didn't ask them because i just wanted to focus on the war yeah but i mean there's so many i'll send you my notes that i wrote i was like a diligent little girl with that would be amazing but i think my ears all these questions and some of them i thought were were pretty funny in your in your case i think the very fact of the interview was the most important yeah that's probably right i did have the the the question that i really wanted to ask that i was almost gonna ask because it made me laugh out loud i was sitting having drinking coffee beforehand with my producers and i was like i'm gonna go there my first question is gonna be mister president i've been here in the kremlin for two days preparing and i haven't seen a single african american in a position of power in the kremlin sure but i thought that's too yeah culturally specific and dry and he'd be like this guy's freaking crazy yeah yeah you don't wanna open with a crazy no i know with a humor i know alright well that's probably doesn't translate it doesn't oh yeah the and there'll be a small delay where you have to wait for the joke like what to see if it lands or not not america at fox you were for a time the most popular host after fox you garnered a huge amount of attention as well same probably more do you worry that popularity and just that attention gets to your head is a kind of drug that clouds your thinking you think i live in a spiritual graveyard of people killed by the quest for fame yes i have lived in that i mean i would say the one advantage the two advantages i have and one i've i've a happy family and a stable family and a stable group of friends which is just the greatest blessing and and a and a strong love of nature and that my family shares so you know i'm in nature every day and you know i have a whole series of rituals designed to keep me from becoming the asshole that i could easily become and but no of course i mean that's what i dis you know that's i and i don't wanna beat up on i'm grateful to elon who you know gave me a platform and and i mean that sincerely but i definitely don't spend a lot of time on social media or on the internet for that exact reason well first of all i think it's as i've said a much more controlled environment than we acknowledge and i don't want lies in my head but i also don't want to become the sort of person who's seeking the adulation of strangers i think that's soul poison and i said earlier that i think that the desire for power and money will kill you and i believe that and i've seen it a lot but i also think the desire for the love of people you don't know is every bit as poisonous maybe more so and so yes and it's not just because i've you know obviously spent most of my life in public and and in fact i don't spend my life in public i'm completely private person but but professionally i've spent my life in public it's not just that it's like social media makes everybody into a cable news host we're talking off the air my my new i just i'm obsessed with this i don't know enough about it but here's what i do know south korea amazing country great people i grew up around koreans probably no group if i can generalize about a group that i like more than koreans or just smart funny honest brave there's i really like koreans i always have my whole life growing up in southern california with koreans south korea is like dying it's literally dying it's way below replacement rate in fertility its suicide rate is astronomical why is that it's a rich country but of course i don't know the answer but i suspect it has something to do with the penetration of technology into south korean society is the high i think one of the highest certainly one of the highest in the world people live online there and there was a belief in for a bunch of reasons in south korea that western technology would be a liberating progressive force and i think it's been the opposite that's my sense strong sense and i think it's true in this country too i don't understand how people can ignore the decline in life expectancy or the rise in fentanyl use like it's not just about china shipping precursor chemicals to mexico it's like why would you take that shit i hope those two things aren't coupled technological advancement and the well let me ask you and i know you're a technologist and there's a and i respect it and there's a lot of technology that i like and have benefited from i had back surgery and it worked okay so i'm not against all technology but can you name a technology a big technology in the last twenty years that we can say conclusively has improved people's lives well conclusive is a tough thing pretty conclusively i i think that we can brag about i think well you've criticized google search recently but i think making the world knowledge accessible to anyone anywhere across the world through google search well i love that i love that idea are people better informed are they more superstitious and misled than they were twenty years ago i i i think not close i well no i don't know i think they are more informed it's just revealing the ignorance the the internet has revealed the ignorance that people have but i think the ignorance has been decreasing gradually and like if if you look even you can criticize places like wikipedia a lot and many very many aspects of wikipedia are very biased but when you most of it are actually topics that don't have any bias in them because they're not political or so on there's no battle over those topics right and most of wikipedia i i think that's true is like the fastest way to learn about a thing i couldn't agree more you can very quickly imagine you're an expert and that may be the problem i think no it's it's true i just experienced it in moscow it's like again i feel like i'm in the top one percent for information certainly intake because it's my job and i had literal and plus and i'm always out of the country i've been i've been around the world many times like i feel like i know a lot about the rest of the world or i thought i did and how did i not know any of that and maybe i'm just like unusually ignorant or something or reading the wrong things i don't know what it was but all i know is the digital information sources that i use to understand just something as simple as what's the city of moscow like were completely inadequate and anyway look the i just am worried that we're missing the obvious signs and the obvious signs are reproduction life expectancy sobriety if you have a society where people just can't deal with being sober don't wanna have children and are dying younger you have an extremely sick you have a suicidal society okay and i'm not even blaming anyone for i'm just saying objectively that is true and the measure of a health of your society is the number of children that you have and how well they do it's super simple that's the next generation we all die and what replaces us and if you if you don't care then you're suicidal and maybe other things too but that's all i'm saying so what happened to south korea like why can't anyone answer the question they're great people they're rich they have all these advantages they're on the cutting edge of every american for a foreign country they're more american than maybe any other country other than canada and like what happened and i mean your fundamental worry is the same kind of thing might be happening or will happen in the united states well let me just ask you this i think north korea seems like the most dystopian horrible place in the world right obviously it's a byword for dystopia right north korean i use it all the time and i mean it if in a hundred years there are more north koreans still alive than there are south koreans what does that tell us yeah that's something to worry about but also how did it how did it happen like why i'm interested in the why this is a question i asked putin you know sometimes we don't know why but why does no one ask why i've seen a lot of increased distrust in science which is deserved in many places it just worries me because some of the greatest inventions of humanity come from science and technological innovation okay then let me ask you a couple quick questions and perhaps you have the answer and i've always assumed that was true and i should say that when i was a kid i lived in la jolla california next to the salk institute named after jonas salk a resident of la jolla california mhmm who who created the polio vaccine and saved untold billions and so my belief which is still my belief actually that's a great thing it's one of the great additions to human flourishing ever but if technology is so great why is life expectancy going down and why are fewer people having kids and why would anybody who has internet access ever use fentanyl what is that what is going on and until we can answer that question i think we have to cons assume the question of whether technology is a net good or a net bad is is unresolved like at best right at best perhaps but technology is the very tool which will allow us to have that kind of discourse to figure out to do science better i mean i want that to be true and when you said that the internet allows people to escape the darkness of ignorance man that resonate with me because i felt that way in nineteen ninety three four when it was first starting and i first got on it and i thought man this is amazing you can talk for free to anyone around the world this is gonna be great but let me ask you this this is something i've never gotten over or gotten a straight answer to why is it that in any european city the greatest buildings indisputably were built before electricity and the machine age why has no one ever built a medieval cathedral in the modern era ever well what is that indisputably you're have a presumption we have a good definition of what beauty is there's a lot of people right let's be specific pick a european city or any city in the world and tell me that there's a prettier building than say notre dame before it was set fire to there's other sources of prettiness and beauty there's a purely architecture of of course trees are prettier than any building in my opinion so i agree with that but also there could be i mean i i i grew up in the pre internet age good but if good but if you grew up in the internet age i i think your eyes will be more open to beauty that's digital that is in a digital i'm not discounting the possibility of digital beauty at all and you know the ted kaczynski in me wants to but i that's too close minded i agree i'm completely willing to believe there is such a thing as digital beauty i i mean i have digital pictures of my phone of my dogs and kids so i know that there is but purely in the realm of architecture because it's like limited and and it is you know one of the pure expressions of human creativity we need mhmm places to live and work and worship and eat and so we build buildings and every civilization has but the machine age the industrial age seemed to have decreased the quality and the beauty in our in that one expression of human creativity architecture and why is that well i could also argue that you know i'm a big sucker for bridges and yeah modern bridges can give older bridges a run for their money but i like bridges too so i agree with you sort of but like the brooklyn bridge i don't i don't know that there's any modern bridges you know that was built in late nineteenth century yeah very much in the industrial age but i'm just saying like the great cathedrals of europe yeah even the pyramids whoever built them it doesn't it seems like if you i it's just it's like super obvious i'm just like i'm dealing on the autism level here just like well why is that but that's a good way to start if all of a sudden you have electricity and hydraulics and you have access i mean i have machines in my woodshop at home that are so much more advanced than anything than any cathedral builder in fifteenth century europe had and yet there's neither i nor anyone i know could even begin to understand how a flying buttress was built right and so what is that and the other question is also consider that whatever is creating this technology is unstoppable well there's that and the question is like how do you steer it then you have to look in a realist way at the world uh-huh and say that if you don't somebody else will and you want to do it in a safe way i mean this is the manhattan project was the manhattan project a good idea to create nuclear weapons that that's an easy call no for me it's an easy call in retrospect in retrospect yes because it seems like it stopped world wars so the mutually assured destruction seems to have ended wars ended major military war it's been what eighty years not even eighty years seventy nine and so we haven't had a world war in seventy nine years but one nuclear exchange would of course kill more people than all wars in human history combined so you're saying seventy nine makes it sound like you're counting i am counting because i think it obviously it's like completely demonic and everyone pretends like it's great you know nuclear weapons are evil yeah no absolutely of them is evil and the technology itself is evil and in my i mean it's just like if you can't that's just so obvious and that's what what i'm saying is like i'm not against all technology i took a shower this morning mhmm it was powered by an electric pump yep heated by a water heater like i loved it i sat in an electric sauna you know like i'm not against all technology obviously but the mindless worship of technology sure mindless worship of anything is pretty bad but i'm just saying so you said let's approach this from a realist perspective okay let's if we think that there is a reasonable or even a potential chance it could happen maybe on the margins let's assign it a fifteen percent chance that ai for example gets away from us and we are now ruled by machines that may actually hate us who knows what they want why wouldn't we use force to stop that from happening so you're walking down the street in midtown manhattan it's midnight you've had a few drinks you're coming from dinner you're walking back to your apartment a guy a very thuggish looking guy young man mhmm approaches you he's fifty feet away mhmm he pulls out a handgun he lifts it up to you you also are armed do you shoot him or do you wait to get shot because all the data look he hasn't shot you he's not committed a crime other than carrying a weapon in your city maybe he's got a license you don't know mhmm could be legal but he's pointing a gun at you is it fair to kill him before he kills you even though you can't prove that he will kill you if if i knew my my skills with a gun because he already has the gun but but it turns out that you you know you have some confidence in your ability okay okay to stop the threat by force are you justified in doing that i just like this picture am i wearing a cowboy hat no no but you're wearing cowboy boots and they're clicking on the cobblestones stones actually we're in the meat packing k great i like this picture i'm just yeah i i think about this a lot actually no yeah i i understand your point but also the i do think that metaphor falls apart if there's if there's other nations at play here so if the same as with the nuclear bomb if us doesn't build it will other nations build it the soviet union build it china or nazi germany we face this i mean we face this and the last president to try and keep in a meaningful way nuclear proliferation under control was john f kennedy and look what happened to him but but what what's your suggestion like is it well no no i mean inevitable their well their position in nineteen sixty two was no it's absolutely not inevitable and or perhaps it's inevitable in the sense that our death is inevitable but you know as human beings but we fight against the dying of the light anyway because that's the right thing to do no we were willing to use force to prevent other countries from getting the bomb because we thought that would be really terrible because we acknowledged that while there were upsides to nuclear weapons just like there are upsides to ai the downside was terrifying in the hands of i mean that's the thing that i kind of don't get it's like the applications of that technology in the hands of people who mean to do harm and destroy it's like so obviously terrifying it's not so obvious to me what i'm terrified about is probably similar thing that you're terrified about is using that technology to manipulate people's minds that's much more reasonable to me as an expectation yeah a a a real threat that's possible in the next few years but what matters more than that well i think that could lead to like destruction of human civilization through other humans for example starting nuclear wars yeah well i mean this is one of the reasons i wasn't afraid in the vladimir putin interview because it's like it's all ending anyway you know what i mean yeah well might as well dance on the deck of the titanic don't be a pussy enjoy it i think we will forever fight against the dying of the light as the entirety of this is someone the other day said that biden ascribed that to churchill that was a churchill quote that's kind of what i'm saying it's like if you live in a society where people don't read anymore like people are by definition much more ignorant mhmm and you like but they don't know it it's like i do think the wikipedia culture and i think there are cool things about wikipedia certainly it's ease of use is high and that's great but people get the sense that like oh i know a lot about you know this or that or the other thing and it's like the key to wisdom again the key to wise decision making is knowing what you don't know and it's just so important to be reminded of what a dummy you are and how ignorant you are all the time yeah that's why i like having daughters it's like it's never far from mine how flawed i am and that's important yeah i in the same way i hope to be a dad oh one day have a ton of are you gonna have a ton of pups five oh pup what you mean like children yes five but also i've been thinking of getting a dog but unrelated i would love to have like five or six kids yeah for sure what have you found a victim yet you make it sound so romantic tucker just joking i love it no you should totally do that yeah one hundred percent but also in terms of being humble you know i i do jiu jitsu it's a martial art where you get your ass kicked all the time i love that it's nice to get your ass physical humbling is unlike anything else i think because we're kinda monkeys at heart and just getting your ass kicked just really helpful i've had it happen to me twice and twice is enough it got me to quit drinking you know i was good at starting fights not good at winning them but no i completely agree with that let me ask you you've been pretty close with donald trump your private texts about him around the twenty twenty election were made public in one of them you said you passionately hate trump when that came out you said that you actually know you love him so how do you explain the difference you know my text reflect a lot of things including how i feel at the moment that i sent them that specific text i happen to know since i had to go through it forensically during my deposition in a case i was not named in i had nothing to do with whatsoever it's crazy how civil suits can like be used to hurt people you disagree with politically but i was mad at a very specific purse i mean really what what that i mean you're asking me i'll tell you exactly what that was it was the second the election ended and they stopped voting stopped the vote counting on election night i was like well this is and it's all now mail in ballots electronic voting machines i was like that's a rigged election i thought that then i think it now now it's obvious that it was but at the time i was like i feel like there's that was like crazy what just happened i want but i don't wanna go on tv and say that's a rigged election because i don't have any evidence this is a rigged election you can't do that it's irresponsible and it's wrong so i was like i want the trump campaign was making all these claims about you know this or that fraud so i was trying my best to to substantiate them to follow-up on it everyone else is like shut up trump you lost go away we're gonna indict you but i felt like my job was to be like no the guy's he's president he's claiming the election just got stolen and he's making these claims let's see if we can well the people around him were like so incompetent it was just absolutely crazy and i so i'd i called a couple of i finally gave up but i'd call and be like alright you guys claim that these inconsistencies and this you know whatever this happened give me evidence and i'll put it on tv you know it's my job to bring stuff that is not gonna be aired anywhere else to the public i couldn't i it was like it was insane how incompetent and unserious they weren't able to provide like well here's the here's the point of the story and of that text so then they come out and say well dead people voted well that's just an easy call okay if a dead person voted we can prove someone's dead because like being dead is one of the few things we're good at like verifying because you start to smell k and there's a record of it it's called the death certificate so it was like give me the names of people who are dead who voted and then we can get their registration and we can show they voted five names so i go on tv and i say this you know caroline johnson seventy nine of waukegan illinois voted here's her death certificate she died and the campaign sends me this stuff now i in general don't take stuff directly from campaigns because they all lie because their job is to get elected or whatever so i i'm very wary of campaigns having been around it for thirty years so like but i made an exception to my rule and i got a bunch of stuff from them well like of the six names two of them were still alive what i was so well i immediately corrected it the next night cnn did a whole segment on how i was spreading disinformation which i was by the way in this one case they were right i was so mad i was like i hate you i'm not talking about you i'm so mad anyway that's the answer that's what that was who are you texting to my producer and i was like venting it's like a producer i was really close to and i've known him for a long time he's really smart and and he's like he was someone i could like be honest with and i was like ah and by the way it's so funny i mean now i'm doing what was me which i i will keep to a minimum but it's like stealing someone's text like what how and by the way i was an idiot i should have said come and arrest me i'm not giving you my freaking text messages okay yeah but i got bullied into it by a lawyer i didn't get bullied into it i was weak enough to agree with a lawyer my fault never should've done that fuck you they're my texts they're total i'm not even named in this case i that's what i should have said but i didn't i said i was mad on the air the next day but not in language that colorful but whatever whatever i try to be i try to be transparent i mean i also think by the way if you watch someone over time you don't always know what they really think but you can tell if someone's lying you know you can sort of feel it in people and i have lied i'm sure i'll lie again i don't wanna lie you know i mean i don't think i'm a liar i try not to be a liar i don't wanna be a liar i think it's like really important not to be a liar you said nice things about me earlier i'm starting to question i have questions i have a lot of questions talking about i hate lex freeman yeah i'm gonna have to see your texts after this so you my texts are so uninteresting now it's like crazy how uninteresting they are em emojis and gifs lots of dog pictures nice you said just some degree the election was rigged was was it stolen was a hundred percent stolen are you joking rigged to that large of a yeah they they completely change the way people vote right before the election on the basis of covid which had nothing to do with way it was rigged meaning percent and then manipulated then you censor the information people are allowed to get anyone who complains about covid which is like by the way it might have hurt trump but i mean it's like or whatever i mean you could play it many different ways you can't have censorship in a democracy by definition here's how it works the people rule they vote for representatives to carry their agenda to the capital city and get it enacted that's how they're in charge and then every few years they get to reassess the performance of those people in an election in order to do that they need a they need access unfettered access to information and no one particularly not people who are already in power is allowed to tell them what information they can have they have to have all information that they want whether the people in charge want it or don't want it or think it's true or think it's false it doesn't matter and the second you don't have that you don't have a democracy it's not a free election period and that's very clear in other countries i guess but it's not clear here so but i would say it's this election that i mean it took me a while to come to this but it's this election that's the referendum on democracy biden is senile he's literally senile he can't talk he can't walk the whole world knows that leave our borders people are you know everybody everybody in the world knows it he can't he can't you can't a senile man is not gonna get elected in the most powerful country in the world unless there's fraud period like who would vote for a senile man he's lit he literally can't talk and nobody i've ever met thinks he's running the us government because he's not and so i think the world is looking on at this coming election and saying and a lot of the world hates trump okay it's not an endorsement of trump but it's true if joe biden gets reelected democracy is a freaking joke it's just true i think half the country doesn't think he's senile just thinks he's you really think that speaking they don't think he's senile yeah i think he just has difficulty speaking it's like gradual like gradual degradation just getting old so cognitive ability is degrading what's the difference between degraded cognitive ability and senility well senility has a threshold like it's beyond the threshold to where he could be a functioning leader okay okay that may be a term of art that i don't fully understand and maybe there's like an iq threshold or something but i'm happy to go with degraded cognitive ability sure but that's an age thing but he's the leader of the united states with the world's second largest nuclear arsenal i'm with you i'm a sucker for great speeches and for speaking abilities of leaders and biden with two wars going on and potentially more the importance of a leader to speak eloquently both privately in a room with other leaders and publicly is really important i agree with you that rhetorical ability really matters convincing people if that your program is right telling them what we're for national identity national unity all come from words i agree with all of that but at this stage even someone who grunted at the microphone would be more reassuring than a guy who clearly doesn't know where he is and it and i think everyone knows that and like i can't imagine there's an honest person in washington which is gonna vote for biden by ninety percent obviously because they're all dependent on the federal government for their income but is there any person who could say like out of three hundred and fifty million americans like that's the most qualified to lead or even in the top eighty percent like what that's so embarrassing that that guy is our president and with wars going on it's it's scary but it's it's complicated to understand why those are the choices we have i agree well it's a failure of the system clearly it's not working if you've got one guy over eighty the the guy other guy almost at eighty like people that he should not be running any so why you have on the democratic side you have dean phillips you have rk junior until recently i guess he's independent and then you have vivek who are all younger people yeah why did they not connect to a degree to where the people it's such an interesting i mean i think it's a really interesting there oh there are a million different answers and and of course i'm i don't fully understand it even though i feel like i've watched it pretty carefully but i would say the bottom line is there's so much money vested in the federal apparatus in the parties in the government as i said a minute ago our economy is dominated by monopolies but the greatest of all monopolies is the federal monopoly which oversees and controls all the other monopolies so it's like it's really substantially about the money it's not ideological it's about the money and if someone controls the federal government i mean at this point it's the most powerful organization in human history like it's kinda hard to it's kinda hard to fight that in the case of trump i i know the answer there they raided mar a lago they indicted him on bullshit charges like and i felt that in myself too even i was like come on come on you know like whatever you think of trump and i agreed with his immigration views and i really like trump personally i think he's hilarious and interesting which he is but it's like okay not a lot of people in this country let's let's get some you know let's have a at at very least like let's have a real debate the second messed up your camera sir sorry i'm getting excited but the second they raided mar a lago on a documents charge as someone from dc i was like i know a lot about classification and all that stuff and been around it a lot that's so absurd that i was like now it's not about trump it's about our system continuing like if you can take out a presidential candidate on a fake charge use the justice system to take the guy out of the race then we don't have a representative democracy anymore and and i think a lot of republican voters felt that way if they hadn't indicted him i'm not sure he would be the nominee i really don't think he would be so now a vote for trump is a kind of fuck you to the system or an expression of your desire to keep the system that we had which is one where voters get to decide prosecutors don't get to decide look they told us for four years that trump was like a supercriminal or something i've actually been friends with some supercriminals i'm a little less judgy than most so i didn't discount the possibility that he had i don't know he's in the real estate business in new york in the seventies like did he kill someone i don't know yeah you know no i'm i'm i'm not joking and i'm not for killing people but like anything's possible it's good that you took a stand on that yeah no i'm not joking yeah i was like well who knows you know i realized and i didn't know and what they came up with was a documents charge are you joking and then the sitting president has the same documents violation but he's fine it's like it's just crazy this is happening in front of all of us and then it becomes like at that point it's not about joe biden it's not about donald trump it's about preserving a system which has worked not perfectly but pretty freaking well for two hundred and fifty years i know you don't like trump i get it let's not destroy that system like we can handle another four years of trump i think we can so i'll calm down what we can't handle is a country whose political system is run by the justice department like that is just you're freaking ecuador at that point no so speaking of the justice department cia and intelligence agencies of that nature which you've been traveling quite a bit probably tracked by everybody which is the most powerful intelligence agency do you think cia mossad mi six svr i know keep going the the chinese i it depends what you mean by powerful which one bats above its weight we know which one is massage just to be clear i guess is what you well of course tiny country yeah very sophisticated intel service which one has the greatest global reach in comms which one is most able to read your text i assume the nsa but chinese are clearly pretty good israel is pretty good the french actually are yeah surprisingly good for kind of a declining country their intel services are pretty seem pretty impressive no i'm i love france but you know what i mean and and all that so the but the question i mean i i grew up around all that stuff that's all totally fine like a a strong country should have a a a strong and capable intel service so its policymakers can make informed decisions like that's what they're for and so as as vladimir putin himself noted and i don't talk about it very much but it's true i i applied to the cia when i was in college because you know i was familiar with it because of where i lived and had grown up and everything and i was like it seemed interesting that's honestly the only reason i was like live in foreign countries see history happen like i'm for that i applied to the operations directorate they turned me down on the basis of drug use actually true but anyway whatever i was unsuited for it so i'm glad they turned me down but the point is i didn't see cia as a threat partly because i was bathing in propaganda about cia and i didn't really understand what it was and didn't wanna know but second because my impression at the time was it was outwardly focused it was focused on our enemies i don't have a problem with that as much the fact that cia is playing in domestic politics and actually has for a long time was involved in the kennedy assassination that's not speculation that's a fact and i confirmed that for someone who had read their documents that are still not public it's shocking like you can't have that and i the reason i'm so mad is i really believe in the idea of representative government acknowledging its imperfections but like i should have some say i live here i'm a citizen i pay your all your freaking taxes so the fact that they would be tampering with american democracy is so outrageous to me and i don't know why morning joe is not outraged this parade of dummies highly credentialed dummies they have on morning joe every day they don't seem to that doesn't bother them at all how could that not bother you why is only glenn greenwald mad about it i mean it's confirmed it's not like a fever dream it's real they played in the last election domestically and i guess it shows how dumb i am because they've been doing that for many years i mean the guy who took out mosaddeck lived on my street you know one of the roosevelt's cia officer so i mean again i grew up around this stuff but i never really thought i never reached the obvious conclusion which is that if the us government subverts democracy in other countries in the name of democracy it will over time subvert democracy in my country why wouldn't it that is the corruption is like core it's at the root of it the purpose of the cia was envisioned at least publicly envisioned as an intel gathering apparatus for the executives so the president could make wise foreign policy decisions what the hell is happening in country x i don't know let me call the agency in charge of finding out the point wasn't to freaking guarantee the outcome of elections i'm doing a israel palestine debate next week but i have to ask you just your thoughts maybe even from a us perspective what do you think about hamas attacks on israel what was what would be the right thing for israel to do and what's the right thing for us to do in this if you're looking at the geopolitics of it i mean it's not a topic that i get into a lot because i'm a nonexpert and because i'm not unlike every other american i'm not emotionally invested in other countries just in general i mean i admire them or not and i love visiting them i love jerusalem probably my favorite city in the world but i don't have an emotional attachment to it so maybe i've got more clarity i don't know maybe less here's my view i believe in sovereignty as mentioned and i think each country has to make decisions based on its own interest but also with reference to its own capabilities and its own long term interest and it's very unwise for i'm not a huge fan of treaties some are fine too many bad but i think us aid military aid to israel and the implied security guarantees some explicit but many implied security guarantees of the united states to israel probably haven't helped israel that much long term you know it's a rich country with a highly capable population like every other country it's probably best if it makes its decisions based on what it can do by itself so i'm would definitely be concerned if i lived in israel because i think fair or unfair and really this is another product of technology social media public sentiment in that area is boiling over and i think it's gonna be hard for some of the governments in the region jordan egypt turkey to contain their own populate they don't want conflict with israel at all they were all pretty psyched actually for the trend in progress the saudi peace deal which was never signed but would have been great for everybody because like trade peace normal relations like that's good okay let's just say i know john bolton doesn't like it but it's it's good and it's kind of what we should be looking for but now it's it's not possible and you know if you had like a coalition of countries against israel i know israel's nuclear weapons and has a capable military and all that and the backing of the united states but like you don't it's a small country i think i'd be very worried so there's that and i don't see any advantage in to the united states i mean i don't i i think it's important for each country to make its own decisions but it also is a place like you said where things are boiling over and it could spread across multiple nations into a major military conflict yeah well i think very easily could happen in fact probably right after ramadan if i had to guess and yeah i pray it doesn't but again i don't think you can overstate the lack of wisdom weakness short term thinking of american foreign policy leadership these are the architects of the iraq war of the just the totally pointless destruction of libya totally pointless destruction of syria and the twenty year occupation of afghanistan that resulted in a return to the status quo so like their of the vietnam war their track record of the korean war even going back eighty years is uninterrupted failures one after the other so i just don't have any confidence in those leaders to when was the last time they improved another country can you think of that oh the marshall plan well you look at europe now and you're like i don't know you know if that worked but even if it did work again eighty years ago so when was the last country american foreign policy makers improved so if i were netanyahu's in a very difficult place politically impossible i mean i'm glad i'm not netanyahu and i'm not sure he's capable of making wise long term decisions anyway but if i was just like an israeli i'd be like i don't know if i want like all this help and guidance so yeah i actually think it's worse than just having just returned from the middle east and talking to a lot of pretty open minded sort of pro israeli arabs who want stability above all the merchant class always wants stability so i'm on their side i guess and they they're like man this could get super ugly super fast american leadership is completely absent the pa it's just all posturing it's like people like nikki haley you just wonder like how does an advanced civilization promote someone like nikki haley to a position of authority it's like what adults are talking adults are talking nikkil can you please go away like that that would be the the appropriate response but everyone's so intimidated they'd be like oh she's a strong woman she's so transparently weak and sort of ridiculous and doesn't know anything and is just like thinks that jumping up and down and making these absurd blanket statements repeating bumper stickers is like leadership or something it's like a self confident advanced society would never allow nikki haley to advance i mean she's really not impressive sorry i i just feel like you hold back too much and don't don't tell us what you really think sorry i think you just just speak your mind we're off you're not i mean you could completely disagree with my opinions but in the case of nikki haley it's not like an an opinion form just from watching television which i don't watch it's an opinion form from knowing nikki haley so strong words from tucker well felt too well the world's in the balance i mean it's not just like this is important stuff yeah it's not just like well you know what should the capital gains rate be it's like do we live or die i don't know let's consult nikki haley so if you're asking should we live or die in consulting nikki haley clearly you don't care about the lives of your children that's how i feel not to try to get a preview or anything but do you have interest of interviewing xi jinping and if you do how will you approach that well i have enormous interest in doing that enormous and a couple other people and we're working on it yeah i should also say like it's been refreshing you interviewing world leaders i think when i've started seeing you do that it made me realize how much that's lacking well yeah it's just interesting i mean i from even a historical perspective it's interesting but it's also important from a geopolitics perspective well it's really changed my perspective and i've been going on about how american i am and i think that's a great thing i love america but it's also you know we're so physically geographically isolated from the world even though i traveled a ton as a kid a lot you know more than most people but even now i'm like i'm so parochial i'm so i see everything through this lens and getting out and seeing the rest of the world to which we really are connected like that's real is is vitally important so i yeah i mean at this stage i don't you know kind of need to do it but i really want to just motivated by curiosity and trying to expand my own mind and not be close minded and really see the fullest perspective i possibly can in order to render wise judgments i mean that that's like the whole journey of life i was just hanging out with rogan yesterday joe rogan and you know i mentioned to him that it's me being a fan of his show that i would love for him to talk with you and he said he's up for it any reason you guys haven't done it already i don't know i would i there's no i've only met rogan once and i and i liked him i met him at the ufc in new york he was with that's right somebody at we a mutual friend of ours and i you know rogan changed media i mean maybe more than anybody and he did it what i love about what i admire about rogen without knowing him beyond meeting him that one time i mean i'm still in media but i've always been in media you know it's like not a great surprise i'm doing what i've always done just a different format but rogen like he's got one of those resumes that i admire you you know i like the guy who was like i was a longshoreman i was a short order cook i was an astrophysicist i was he was like he's called a man of parts and this guy was a a fighter a stand up comic he hosted some you know fear factor like how did he wind up at the vanguard of like the deepest conversations in the country like how did that happen so i definitely respect that and i think it's cool and he rogan is one of those people who just kind of came out of nowhere like no one helped him mhmm you know what i mean doing he was doing the thing that he loves doing and it somehow keeps accidentally being exceptionally successful yeah and he's curious so that that's like the main thing and there was a guy without getting boring but there was a guy i worked with years ago who like kind of dominated cable news larry king and everyone would always beat up on larry king for being dumb well i got to know larry king well and i was a film host for a while and larry king was just intensely curious he'd be like why do you wear a black tie lex look because i like black tie why do you like black tie no no everyone else wears a striped tie you wear a black one white and he would like he was like really interested yeah genuinely so yeah totally and and i wanna be like that i don't wanna think i know everything that's so boorish and also false you don't know everything but i see that in rogen mhmm rogen's like raw how does that work and people and it's so funny how that's threatening to people it's like rogan will just sit there while someone else is you know free balling on some far out topic which by the way might be true probably truer than the conventional explanation people like i don't know how can he stand that you know he had someone say the pyramids weren't built three thousand years ago but eight thousand years ago and that's wrong it's like first of all how do you know when the pyramids were built second why do you care if someone disagrees with you like what is that this weird kind of like groupthink it's it's almost like you know fourth grade there's always like some little girl in the front row who's like acting as the you know kind of the teacher's enforcer they whip around and be like sit down didn't you hear it missus johnson said sit down that's like the you know what i mean it's like the whole american media how dare you ask that question and rogan just seems like completely on his own trip like he doesn't even hear it he's like well really when were the pyramids built and i was like oh i love that yeah curiosity open mindedness the thing i admire about him most honestly is that he's a good father he's a good husband he's a good family man for many years and like that's his place where he escapes from the world too and it's just beautiful without that man you're destroyed yeah if i had a wife who was interested at all in any way in what i did i think i would have gone crazy by by now when we get home we don't she's like how was your day it was great oh i'm so proud of you that's the end of our conversation about what i do for a living and that is such a wonderful and essential respite from you said how do i not become an asshole to the extent i haven't i kinda have but how do i have i've like not been you know transformed into a totally insufferable megalomaniac who like is checking his twitter replies every day or every minute it's that yeah you gotta have the core of your life has to be solid and enduring and not just ephemeral and silly so the the two of you have known each other for what forty years we've been together forty years together forty years forty years yeah nineteen eighty four he's the hottest fifteen year old in newport rhode island wow sounds dirty but i was i'm talking about myself i was the hottest girl yeah you were just looking in the mirror yeah very nice so what's what's the secret to a successful relationship successful marriage i don't even know i mean no i'm i'm serious yeah i got married in august twenty one so that's well it's our thirty third year of being married fall that the collapse of the season yeah yeah as noted yeah so you know you hear these people it's actually changed my theology a little bit not that i have deep theology but like i grew up in a society in southern california when when when i was little that was like a totally self created society i mean southern california was it was that root of libertarianism for a reason it was like that's where you went to recreate yourself and so the the operative assumption there is that you are the sum total of your choices and that free will is everything and we never consider questions like well why do children get cancer like what do they do to deserve it well of course nothing right because that would suggest that maybe you're not the sum total your choices matter if i smoke a lot i get lung cancer if i use fentanyl i may od got it if i don't exercise i might get fat okay but like on a bigger scale you're not only the subtotal sum total of your choices like things happen to you that you didn't deserve good and bad and marriage is and i'll speak for myself in that in my case just one of them and i could say i mean clearly spending time with the person you're married to talking enjoying each other you know i i have a lot of rituals we have a lot of rituals that ensure that but in forty years like you you're like a different person you know i like did drugs i was drinking all the time when we met you know it's been a long time since i've been done that and i'm very different so is she but we're different in ways that are complimentary and happy i've never been happier so like how do we pull that off just kind of good luck honestly and then i see other peep no i'm i'm not kidding but that's true i think it's so important not to flatter yourself if you've been successful at something the thing i've been most successful at is marriage but i it's not really me i mean i haven't so i think what you're indirectly communicating is it's like humility i think it's not even humility is the result of a reality based worldview sure okay right reality once you see things clearly yeah then you know that you are not the author of all your successes or failures and i hate the implication otherwise because it suggests powers that people don't have it's one of the reasons i always hated the smoking debate or the covid debate someone die of covid to do not have vaccine see this is what you get you smoke cigarettes you die well shit i've you know yeah if you smoke cigarettes you more likely get lung cancer if you don't if you get whatever the cause and effect is real i'm not denying its existence it's obvious but it's not the whole story there are larger forces acting on us unseen forces that's just a fact you don't need to be some kind of religious nut and they act on ai too and you should keep that in mind the idea that all same way you said that no it's true it's yeah it it's demonstrably true we're the only society that hasn't acknowledged the truth of that and the idea that the only things that are real are the things that we can see or measure in a lab like that's insane that's just dumb in the religious context you have this two categories that i really like that of the two kinds of people people who believe they are god and people who know they are not which is a really interesting division that speaks to humility and a kinda realist worldview of where we are in the world oh can can atheists be in the latter category no there are very few atheists i've never actually met one there are people who pose as atheists but no one's purely rational and everyone i mean this is a cliche for a reason everyone under extreme stress appeals to a power higher than himself because everyone knows that there is a power higher than himself so really it's just people who are gripped with the delusion that they're god no one actually believes that if you're god jump off the roof of your garage and see what happens you know what i mean no one actually thinks that but people behave as if it's true and those people are dangerous and i will say by contrast the only people i trust are the people who know their limits and i was thinking actually this morning in my sauna of all the people i've interviewed or met this is someone i never interviewed but i have talked to him a couple of times the greatest leader i've ever met in the world is literally a king it's mbz sheikh mohammed of abu dhabi who is muslim i am definitely not muslim i'm christian protestant christian and so i don't agree with his religion and i don't agree with monarchies but he's the best leader in the world that i've ever met and by far it's like not even close and why is that well there i could bore you for an hour on the subject but the the the reason that he's such a good leader is because he's guided by an ever present knowledge of his limitations and of the limits of his power and of his foresight and when you start there when you start with reality it's not even humility humility can be a pose like oh i'm so i'm so humble okay humblebrag is a phrase for a reason it's like way deeper than that it's just like no can i do i have magical powers can i see the future no okay that's just a fact so i'm not god but i've never seen anybody more at ease with admitting that and want than mbz just a remarkable person and for that reason he is like treated as an oracle i don't think people understand the number of world leaders who traipse through his house or palace to seek his counsel is there's i i'm not sure that there is a parallel since i don't wanna get too hyperbolic here but honestly since like solomon where people come from like around the world to ask what he thinks now why would they be doing that because abu dhabi's military is so powerful i mean he's rich okay massive oil and gas deposits but like for a lot of you know so is canada you know what i mean no one is coming to ottawa tahoe to ask justin trudeau what he thinks no it's humility that's where wisdom comes from you start to think like because i spent my whole life like mad at america's leadership class because it's not just biden or the people in official positions it's the whole constellation of advisers and thrown sniffers around them and i'm it's not even that i disagree with them it's i'm not impressed by them i'm just not impressed they're not that capable right so that's what i was saying about nikki haley i don't think she's nikki haley is the most evil person in the world i think she's ridiculous obviously and everyone's like oh nikki haley or mike pompeo what great leaders are so rare that when you see one you know it right away it blows your mind and what blows my mind about sheikh mohammed in abu dhabi is that everyone in the world knows it and i've never seen a story on this and i and i'm i'm not guessing i know this is true because i've seen it everyone in the world knows it and so if there's a conflict he's the only person that people call like everybody calls the same guy and it's like he runs this tiny little country the uae i mean he's the in abu dhabi they're a bunch of emirates but he's the president of the country but still and it's got a ton of energy and all that so wealth and all that and dubai's got great real estate and restaurants but but really it's a tiny little country that wasn't even a country fifty years ago so how did that happen purely on the basis of his humility and the wisdom that results from that humility that's it what advice would you give to young people you got four you somehow made them into great human beings what advice would you give to people in high school have children immediately oh that including in high school yes i think that that's all that matters like in the end you know again these aren't even cliches anymore because no one says them but when i was a kid people would say on your deathbed you never wish you spent more time at work and i mean everyone said that it was like one of these things and now now i don't think google allows you to say that it's like no you're gonna wish you spent more time at work get back to your cube but i can't overstate from my vantage how true that is nothing else matters but your family and if you have the opportunity and a lot of people are being denied the opportunity to have children and this messing with the gender roles and i'm not even talking about the tranny stuff i mean the i mean feminism has so destroyed people's brains and the ability of young people to connect with each other and stay together and have fruitful lives it's like nothing's been more destructive than that it's such a lie it's so dumb it's counter to human nature and nothing counter to human nature can can endure it can only cause suffering and that's what it's done but fight that stop complaining about it find someone by the way everyone gets together most people get together on the basis in a free in a western society where there's no arranged marriages they get together on a basis of sexual attraction totally natural get off your birth control and have children oh i can't afford that well yeah you'll figure out a way to afford it once you have kids it's like it's chicken and the egg but it's actually not when you have responsibility when you have no this is true of men i'm not sure if true of women it's definitely true of men you will not achieve until you have no choice as i always think of men men do nothing until they have to but once they have to they will do anything that is that is true men will do nothing unless they have to but once they have to they will do anything i really believe that from watching and from being one and i would never have done anything if i didn't have to but i had to and and i would just recommend it and but by the way even if you don't succeed even if you're poor having spent my life among rich people i grew up among rich people i'm a rich person boy are they unhappy well that's clearly not the rude road to happiness you know you don't wanna be a debt slave or starve to death or anything like that but like making a billion dollars that's not worth doing don't do that don't even try to do that if you create something that's beautiful and worth having and you make a billion dollars okay then you have to deal with your billion dollars which will be the worst part of your life trust me but seeking money for its own sake is a is a dead end what you should seek for its own sake is children talk about a creative act last thing i'll say the whole point of life is to create okay the act of creation which is like dying in the west in the arts and in its most pure expression which is children that's all that's worth doing while you're alive is creating something beautiful and creating children by the way it's super fun it's not hard i can get more technical off the air if you want can you yeah please i have a lot of thoughts on it do you have documents or something no i could i could draw you a schematic oh thank you but yeah that's the greatest thing and the fact that corporate america denies oh freeze your eggs have an abortion what you're you're evil are you kidding because you're taking from people the only thing that can possibly give them enduring joy and they are successfully taking it from people and i hate them for it you founded tcn tucker carlson network yeah what's your vision for i have no vision for myself for my career and and i never have so i'm like the last person to explain just roll with it yeah i'm an instinct guy a hundred percent i have a vision for the world but i don't have vision for my life or my career so really my vision extended precisely this far i just wanna keep doing what i'm doing i just wanna keep doing what i'm doing and there was a you know a five hour period where i wondered if i would be able to because i i feel pretty spry and like alert and i'm certainly deeply enjoying what i'm doing which is talking to people and saying what i think and learning constantly learning and but i just wanted to keep doing that and so and i also wanted to employ the people who i worked with at fox i've worked with the same people for years and i love them and so i had you know all these people and i wanted to bring them with me so we had to build a structure for that but this feels like one of the first times you're really working for yourself like the there's an extra level of freedom here totally totally and the good you know i'm not you don't want me doing your taxes like i'm good at some things but i'm really not good at others so i'm more than would be like running a business like no idea i'm not interested not a commerce guy so i don't buy anything so it's like a whole thing i'm not good at but luckily you know i'm really blessed to have friends who are involved in this who are good at that so i feel i feel positive about it but mostly i am i'm totally committed to only doing the things that i am good at and enjoy and not doing anything else because i don't wanna waste my time and so i'm just getting to do what i wanna do and i'm really loving it what hope positive hope do you have for the future of human civilization in let's say fifty years hundred years two hundred years people are great just by their nature i mean they're super complicated but i i like people i always have liked people you know if i was sitting with nikki haley who i've i guess i've been pretty clear i'm not like a mega fan of nikki haley's i would enjoy it you know i've never met anybody i couldn't enjoy on some level given enough time so as long as nobody tampers with the human recipe with human nature itself i will always feel blessed by being around other people and that's true around the world like i've i've never been to a country and i've been to scores of countries where i didn't given a week really like it and like the people so yeah bad leaders are like a you know recurring theme in human history like they're mostly bad and we've got an unusually bad set right now but we'll have better ones at some point i just don't wanna i don't the one the one thing i don't like more than nuclear weapons and more than ai the one thing that really really bothers me is the idea of using technology to change the human brain permanently because you're tampering with the secret sauce you're tampering with god's creation and totally evil i mean i've literally sat there the other day with klaus schwab i was with klaus schwab he's like a total moron i'm like a hundred years old and like has no idea what's going on in the world but he's like one of these guys who speaking of mediocre everyone's so afraid of klaus schwab i don't think klaus schwab is gonna be organizing anything again he's just like a total figurehead like a douchebag but anyway but he was talking and he's reading all these talking points like all what the cool kids are talking about in davos and whatever and he starts talking about it in his survey in his accent he was saying i think it's so important that we follow in an ethical way always in an ethical way of course very ethical i'm a very ethical man that we follow the you know using technology to improve the human mind and implant the chips in the brain and i'm like okay you have no idea what you're talking about you're like as senile as joe biden but what was so striking is that no one in the room was like wait what you're fucking with people's brains like like what are you even talking about who do you think you are you know it's like i mean you're right the secret sauce there the human mind is really special like we should not mess with it it's all very special careful and whatever special thing it does it seems like it's a good thing like human beings are fundamentally good and like these sources of creativity a creative force in the universe we don't wanna mess with oh i mean what else matters i i don't understand i mean i guess look i don't i don't wanna seem like the unabomber and i'm not we are in a cabin in the woods no i know i'm sympathetic to some of his ideas but not of course sending mail bombs to people because i like people but and i don't believe in violence at all but i i think the problem with technology one of the problems with technology is the way that people approach it in a very kind of mindless heedless way and i think it's important this idea that it's inexorable and we can't control it and if we don't do it someone else will and you know there's some truth in that but it's not the whole story we do have free will and we are creating these things intentionally and i think it's incumbent on us it's a requirement of a moral requirement of us that we ask like is this a net gain or a net loss what to the extent we can foresee them will the effects be etcetera etcetera it's like it's not not super complicated so i just i i prize long term thinking i don't always apply it in my own life obviously i i want to but i prize it and i think that people with power should think about future generations and i don't see that kind of thinking at all they all seem like children to me and like don't give children handguns because they can hurt people yeah fundamentally you want people in power to be pro humanity by the way you don't want people who are eighty one who are gonna die anyway why do they care and by the way if your track record with your own family is miserable why would i give you my family to oversee i just don't i like again these are artistic level questions that someone should answer well thank you for asking those questions first of all and thank you for this conversation thank you for welcoming you to the cabin in the woods thank you thanks for listening to this conversation with tucker carlson to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from mahatma gandhi when i despair i remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won there have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they can seem invincible but in the end they always fall think of it always thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
