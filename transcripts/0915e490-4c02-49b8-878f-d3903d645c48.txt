an interesting small scale example of that perhaps you can hear it from my nose at the moment is that i started getting allergies as nature wakes up from its winter slumber and i think it's already a year ago maybe a little bit over than that i got a test for different things i'm allergic to and they put different things on your skin it's like this grid and you get to see what are the things that you're allergic to based on that little grid cell of the skin having an allergic reaction and i was not allergic to most things but there's a few that stood out there's a interesting little data point right it's probably true that over time that changes maybe across a period of months and years based on the medication you take based on the environmental conditions based on your diet all that kind of stuff and so it'd be nice to do that same test over and over and over to get a sense of how my allergic reaction to the world around me changes okay there's a million things like this and the core to you making a good effective decision on what you should do with your life lifestyle health diet whatever is to ground that in data so the core to the allergy thing is data the core to everything inside tracker does is data i'm really excited about personalized data driven advice for how to make your life better get special savings for a limited time when you go to insight tracker dot com slash lex this is a lex fridman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's chris voss what is it like negotiating for a hostage with a kidnapper what is the toughest part of that process the toughest part is if it looks bad from the beginning and you got engaged in a process anyway what are the factors that make it bad what that that makes you nervous that if you were to observe a situation where there's general negotiation or it's a hostage negotiation what makes you think that this is going to be difficult if they wanna make it look like they're negotiating but they're not like in the two thousand four time frame al qaeda in iraq was executing people on camera for the publicity and they wanted to make it look like they were negotiating so they come on and they say if you don't get all the women out of iraqi women out of the the jails in iraq in seventy two hours we're gonna kill a hostage it was one of the demands in one of the cases in that time frame now first of all even if we'd have been willing the us government the coalition would have been willing to do that it wouldn't been able to happen in seventy two hours so is it an impossible ask from the beginning and so then then that looks really bad like they're they're trying to make it they're trying to make it look like they're talking reasonably but they're not so your hostage is in bad shape there if they've made a demand that you just even if you wanted to do you couldn't do so then what makes that very difficult is in kidnappings especially you're working with family members you're coaching people bad guys are in touch with family members or if they're not directly in touch with family members the other thing that al qaeda was doing at that time was they didn't give us a way to talk to them they make they're making statements in the media but then not leaving their phone number if you will yeah so that's one more thing right they're intentionally blocking you they're asking you to do something you can't do they're not giving you a way to talk to them so you gotta get with the family and discuss with the family how you're gonna approach things now the family definitely wants to know is this gonna help so a bunch of cases like that in that time frame and you gotta be honest with them it's a long shot our chances here are slim and none and when it's slim and none i'll take slim but it's still very very slim and there were a number of people that were killed in that time frame before the tide finally got turned and it was it was hard dealing with families at the time can you negotiate in public versus like a direct channel in private oh yeah bad guys pick the media they're making statements in the media so and that's a big clue their their chant their channel of choice tells you an awful lot and if they're choosing the media then that means there's people they're trying to appeal to that means in their view there's such a thing as good media so if there's good media there's bad media how do you make it bad and we made it bad for them it just unfortunately it had to go through a number of iterations before they got the message and quit in that negotiation do you think about the value of human life is there a dollar figure is there how how do you enumerate not enumerate quantify the value of human life yeah that's it's like beauty it's in the eye of the beholder so that was the first lesson on any hostage negotiation really any negotiation like it doesn't matter what it is to you matters what it is to the other side one of the things especially in your in your conversation i listened to with andrew mhmm by the way you guys i i another thing i really liked about that conversation first of all i think the world of him andrew huberman yeah andrew huberman and he released it on my birthday i appreciate that so it's nice project presenting me perfectly just for you yeah yeah nice job thank you but empathy is in the eye of the beholder in every negotiation whether it's over a car a house collaboration in your company with the bad guys how does the other side see it now the nice thing about kidnapping for ransom if there if there's an actual ransom demand it's an actual demand is it's a mercenary's business they're gonna take what they could get and they tend to be really good at figuring out how much money somebody has so and again i'll keep drawing business analogies you're looking for a job with an employer there's a market price of the job and then there's what the employer can pay you now maybe the market price of the job market's a hundred fifty grand employer can pay one twenty but it's a great job you know we're talking about elon a minute ago like i'd work minimum wage to follow him around yeah you know that would be worth it what what are the value other than the dollars mhmm and how hard is it to get the dollars and how quickly can you get to them those are these are all things that the bad guys are good in kidnapping are good at figuring out so the value of human life to them is gonna be what can they get a crazy thing in the kidnap business we used to get asked by fbi leadership when is this gonna be over and the answer would be when a bad guys feel like they've gotten everything they can now dissecting that statement you're talking about when they feel like they got everything they can so the key to kidnapping negotiations are the feelings not bad guys we're talking about feelings kidnappers' feelings yeah which drives everything doesn't matter what human endeavor it is so it's not reason it's emotion there's no such thing as reason i i should say for a little bit of context i just talked yesterday with a guy named sam harris yeah i don't know if you know sam but sam and because i was preparing for a conversation with you i talked to him about empathy versus reason uh-huh and he lands heavily on reason yeah empathy is somewhere between useless and erroneous and leads you astray and is not effective that reason is the only way forward well let's draw some fine lines there and the the two fine lines i would draw is first what is your definition of empathy and then secondly how do people actually make up their minds and i'm and i'm gonna flip it i'm gonna go with how people make up their minds you make up your mind based on what you care about period that makes reason emotion based yeah what do you care about you start with what you care about you see some guy swimming out in off the coast of the ocean and you see a shark coming up behind him who are you cheering for if it's adolf hitler out there you're cheering for the shark you might actually feel bad for a shark because it's gonna it's gonna taste bad who do you care about you mean the human will taste bad yeah you you you know he eats adolf hitler you know that's you're gonna leave a bad taste in your mouth even if you're a shark so you're making up your mind on every circumstances based on what you care about yeah so then what does that do to reason your reason is based on what you care about from the beginning now then empathy if you define it as sympathy which it was never meant to be sympathy mhmm ever you know i've etymology i think is the word i keep getting etymology and entomology mixed up etymology being the right the the you know where words came from the origin entomology being bugs got it right so i like etymology where did something come from also like entomology anyway etymology the my understanding from my research the original definition of empathy was an interpretation of a german word where people were trying to figure out what the artist was trying to convey it was about assessing art and so it was always about understanding where somebody was coming from but not sharing necessarily that same thing so then when i was with the fbi and i first started collaborating with harvard bob mnookin wrote a book beyond winning second chapter is the tension between empathy and assertiveness still the best chapter on empathy i've ever read anywhere and bob writes in his book bob was the head of the program on negotiation he's also agreed to be interviewed for a documentary that's about me and my company that hasn't been released yet but it should be released sometime this year what's the name of the documentary tactical empathy good name so bob's definition of empathy said not agreeing or even liking the other side don't even gotta like them don't gotta agree with them just straight understanding where they're coming from and articulating it which requires no agreement whatsoever that becomes a very powerful tool like ridiculously powerful and if it if sympathy or compassion or agreement are not included you can be empathic with anybody i was thinking about this when i was getting ready to sit down and talk to you because you use the word empathy a lot mhmm putin i can be empathic with putin easy it's easy i don't agree with where he's coming from i don't agree with his methodology early on ukraine russian war i saw an article that was very dismissive of russia that said russia's basically europe's gas station and i thought alright so if you're in charge and the way you feed your people is via an industry that the entire world is trying to quit the whole world is trying to get out of fossil fuels if that's how you feed your people if you don't come up with an answer to that the people that you've taken a responsibility for are gonna die alone in the cold and the dark they're gonna freeze and they're gonna die alright so that doesn't mean that i agree with where he's coming from or any of his means but where where where is how does this guy see things in his distorted word you're never gonna get through to somebody like that in a conversation unless you can demonstrate to them you understand where they're coming from whether or not you agree early nineties last century i'm a last century guy i'm an old dude refer to myself as a last century guy also a deeply flawed human yeah so terrorist case new york city civilian court terrorism does not have to be tried in military tribunals it's a very bad idea it was always bad the fbi was always against it i'm getting ready we have muslims testifying in open court against a legitimate muslim cleric the guy that was on trial had the credentials as a legitimate muslim cleric the people that were testifying against him didn't think he should be advocating murder of innocent people we'd sit down with them arab muslims egyptians mostly and i would say to them you believe that there's been a succession of american governments for the last two hundred years that are anti islamic and they'd shake their head and go yeah and that'd be the start of the conversation that's empathy you believe this to be the case i never said i agreed i never said i disagreed but i showed them that i wasn't afraid of their beliefs i was so unafraid of them that i was willing to just state them and not disagree or contradict because i'd i would say that and then i'd shut up and let them react and i never had to say here's why you're wrong i never gave my point of view every single one of them that testified that's empathy not agreeing with where the other side is coming from i'm not sure how sam would define it but common vernacular is its sympathy and its compassion and that's when it becomes useless and there's a gray area maybe you can comment on it is sometimes a drop of compassion helps make that empathy more effective in the conversation so you're just saying you believe x doesn't quite form a strong of a bond with the other person you're imagining it doesn't maybe you're right yes i'm imagining it doesn't i'm imagining you need to show that you're on the same side that you're you you need to signal a little bit about your actual beliefs at least in that moment even if those that signaling is a is not as deep as it sounds but at first you know basically patting the person on the back and saying we're on the same side brother you know that's that's what most people when they're really learning the concept that's the basic human reaction yeah and in application especially in highly adversarial situations like i i need i need a regular guy muslim but how's that guy gonna say buy it if i like you know dude i'm on your side i've been there i feel you no no no no no no people get conned by that so much like if if we're on opposite sides of the table and i try to act like i'm not on the opposite side of the table that makes me disingenuous so i would rather be honest my you know my currency is integrity and at some point in time if you go like you know where i'm coming from my answer's gonna be like look i can agree on maybe where we're going but if we're talking about you know am i on your side now as a human being i wanna see you survive and thrive not at my expense i think the world is full of opportunity i'm optimistic and i got more than enough reason for saying that it's enough for here for both of us so i got no problem with you getting yours you know just don't take it out of my hide and i'm gonna be honest about it about both of those things i'm i'm not interested in you taking it out of my hide i think there's plenty here for both of us now i don't i don't need to be on your side except in a in a human sense i but i don't do i have to side with you over the war no or the how we're distributing the stock or how much you get paid or how much you make off this car i think people my experience as a layman is that empathy has not got a downside that you don't you don't need me to act like i'm on your side for us to make a great deal great deal well we'll talk about two things a great deal and a great conversation right they're use they're often going to be the same thing but at times they're going to be different that that's a you mentioned vladimir putin there is some zoom level at which you do wanna say we're on the same side you said the human level it's possible to say kinda zoom out and say that we're all in this together not we slavic people we europeans we but we human beings we're the same planet same planet right several years ago and his name has evidently been mud now but he was very nice to meet lawyer here in town named tom gerardi and no shortage of bad reporting on him now i have absolutely no idea if any of it's true i do know that in my interaction with him he was always a gentleman to me and was very generous when he'd get into conversations with people he'd always say like you know let's look at ten years from now where we could both be in a phenomenal place together mhmm now let's work our way back from there that's a good line yeah and then you know i saw him do it in simulations he he i was teaching at usc we were at a function together and a gentleman at that time told me that that he who he was and he was really influential so i walked up to the guy cold and i said hey you know i'm a come in and talk to my class at usc he didn't know me other than the fact that we had mutual acquaintance and he graciously consented to come in and he said what do you want me to talk about and i said look dude dude just from your success here it doesn't matter what you talk about you know either i'm gonna agree or i'm gonna disagree or i'm gonna learn from it my students are gonna learn from it so students wanna role play with them you know they dispute you know let's do a negotiation every single time you go to pick a point in the future where we're both happy ten years twenty years from now and let's work our way back now hostage negotiator same thing i call into a bank bad guy picks up on the picks up on the phone and i'm gonna say i want you to live you know i wanna see you survive this you know whatever else goes with that let's pick a point in the future that we're both good with and then we work our way back and people make also we're talking before about emotion and what you care about people make their decisions based on their vision of the future like with without question yeah there's a i think there's a hindu temple in the united states being has been or being assembled same way that the hindu temples were in india a thousand years ago by hand volunteers by hand these people are knocking themselves on for a place in paradise a vision of the future what you will go through today if the future portends what you want you'll you'll go through incredible things today so it's a vision of the future so you have to try to paint a a vision of the future that the the person you're negotiating with will like just tough to do let's find out what their vision of the future is and then remove yourself as a threat sure you know if we can collaborate together at all if if you think that i could do anything at all to help you to that point and you know integrity is my currency i'm not gonna lie to you which gets back before that i lied to you about whether or not i'm on your side you know right now none of at the moment we're on opposite side's defense mhmm that's not gonna stop us from being together in the future inside you're gonna say oh well you didn't lie to me about today maybe you won't lie to me about tomorrow so going back to world leaders for example whether it's volodymyr zelensky or vladimir putin you don't think it closes off their mind to show that you have a different opinion depending upon when you showed it is that is are you arguing from the beginning or are you displaying understanding from the beginning i don't i don't think it stops you from being adversarial that was the thing about manukin's chapter in his book the tense tension between empathy and assertiveness mhmm i remember reading that reading that name of the chapter thinking like you know in my business there is no tension and then i got into it and i read i thought this is red herring he's drawing people in because his entire chapter is that empathy puts you in a position to assert and that there is no tension it's a sequencing issue and that's why again i think it's it it was written for lawyers yeah sequencing issue the timing is everything so you emphasize the importance of in terms of sequencing and priority of listening of truly listening right to the other person i'm sorry what'd you say that was a bad joke i'm sorry that your timing is just perfect how how do you how do you listen how do you truly listen to another human being how do you notice them how do you really hear them i always hated the term active listening if anything it's proactive mhmm and as soon as you start to try to anticipate where somebody's going you're dialed in more because along the way either you're congratulating yourself for being right or when suddenly they say something that surprises you you really notice it like that's not what i expected you're dialed in you're listening so it's it's proactive and then one of the reasons you know we named the book tactical empathy named named the book never split the difference but we're talking about tactical empathy calibrated emotional intelligence what's it calibrated by first it was experienced as hostage negotiators but and we've come to find out that our experience as hostage negotiators is backed up by neuroscience another reason why i listen to andrew huberman's podcast all the time heavy heavy heavy heavy on the neuroscience mhmm and so then emotional intelligence calibrated by what we know about neuroscience what do we know about neuroscience and i'll talk about it from a layman's perspective and and to even say we is an arrogant thing you know human beings i i didn't do the research i'm scooping up as much of it as i can as a layman the brain's largely negative i think there's ample evidence people would argue with you as to what the wiring is and what does what and the limbic system and all of that but the brain is basically seventy five percent negative as an alignment i make that contention number one number two the best way to deactivate negativity is by calling it out and i could say look i don't i don't want you to be offended by what i'm getting ready to say that's a denial your guard is up you're getting ready to get mad if i say what i'm getting ready to say is probably gonna offend you now you relax a little bit and you go alright what is it and then i say it whatever it is and you're gonna be like oh that wasn't that bad because we knew from hostage negotiation by calling out the negativity deactivate it and then number of neuroscience experiments have been done right and left by calling out negativity deactivating the negativity call calling out ahead of time so like acknowledging that this is that that this is go ahead of time that this is going to hurt the experiments that i've seen have been when the negativity was inflicted and then having a person that it was being inflicted upon simply identify it just identify yeah what are you feeling i'm angry and the anger goes away it's tough because i've had a few and again we're dancing between things but i've had a few conversations where anger arose in the guest i spoke with yeah and i'm not sure identifying it that that that's like leaning into it and going into the depths because that that's going to the depths of some emotional psychological thing they're going through that i'm not sure i wanna explore that iceberg with a little ship we got i i it's a you have to decide do you want to avoid it or do you wanna lean into it it's a tough choice it's an elephant in the room it is an elephant in the room it is an elephant especially when i think that's the big difference between conversations and negotiations negotiation ultimately is looking for closure and resolution i think general conversations like this is more exploring there's not necessarily a goal like if you were to put like if i had to put a goal for this conversation there's no real goal it's curiously exploring ideas so that'll gives you freedom to not call out the elephant for for time you could be like alright let's go to the next room get a snack and come back to the elephant right alright so i'd i'd i'd make a tiny adjustment on the negotiation definition sure because you said i think seeking closure you you used two words and closure was one of them goals maybe another well yeah what is what what is negotiation well i would say seeking collaboration and because closure kinda puts a little bit of a finality to it and a real problem and any negotiation is always implementation that's why we say yes as i say we yes is nothing without how and and yes at its at its very best it's only temporary aspirations it's aspirational it's usually counterfeit so if you're looking for k it's a good line yes it's usually counterfeit it's aspirational without the how yeah it's just a good line yeah thank you i've been working on it i was practicing i in front of the mirror for a two minute break you got you got a bright future i think you should write a book or something right yeah your book is excellent by the way thanks appreciate that what am i doing here anyway this at earth in general you with you i don't know we're collaborating why me though why why why'd you why'd you wanna talk to me i've heard you speak in a few places i was like this this is a fascinating human i think on clubhouse and different places and i alright i listen to some youtube stuff and this is just you meet people that are interesting that that's that's what i love doing with this podcast is just exploring the mind of an interesting person you notice people i take care sometimes you sometimes it's like a homeless person it's outside of seven eleven i noticed who are you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's fascinating it doesn't like i don't look at the resumes and the credentials and stuff like that it's just being able to notice a person as i've been leafing through the different choices of the podcast sure the the young lady that onlyfans and the sex workers that's a fascinating human being yeah it's fascinating like i wanna know what makes that person tick mhmm at thousand percent the fascinating thing about her is her worldview is almost entirely different than mine and that's always interesting to talk to a person who just is happy flourishing but sees the world and the set of values she has is completely different and and is also not argumentative it's accepting of other world views it's it's beautiful to explore that yeah no kidding i would agree and then yeah thought provoking because i consider myself the word i was looking for before is abundant i think it's an abundant world so i'm i'm pretty optimistic i consider myself i don't know happy exactly describes it but yeah you know i'm a so then if i'm happy optimistic abundant i got a worldview and then you run into somebody that has a vastly different worldview and they're happy and a and they think it's abundant too and you're like what is going on in your head or mine or what am i missing mhmm yes that's fascinating and the pie grows which is useful for kinda negotiation when you paint a picture of a future if you're optimistic about that future there's a kinda feeling like we're both gonna win here exactly and that's easy we live in a world where both people can win yeah and and in point of fact that's the case although it's a lot of people want us to think otherwise mostly because of the negativity that i was talking about before so the brain is generally cynical yeah my description of it is the pessimistic caveman survived and we're descendants of the pessimists yeah you know optimistic guy got eaten by a saber tooth tiger yeah but on the flip side the optimists seem to be the ones that actually build stuff these days there's a switch like so at what point in time do we catch on because the difference between survival and success mindset the success mindset is highly optimistic mhmm so where do we switch or how do we stay switched from survival to success that's the challenge yeah somewhere we stopped being eaten by saber toothed tigers and started building bridges and buildings and computers and companies and we started to experience we got enough data back to collaborate and we stop listening to our amygdala and we start to listen to our gut let me just to return briefly to terrorists what do you think about the policy of not negotiating with terrorists well that's not the policy first of all now everybody thinks that's the policy yeah it hasn't been a policy since two thousand and two when bush forty three signed a national security presidential directive nspd at the time it was nspd twelve which basically said we won't make concessions that doesn't mean we won't talk so i'm in colombia at the same time and i have been intimately involved with the signing of him signing that document i knew exactly what it said and i and he didn't inherit it from somebody else he signed it and i'm in colombia and the number two in the embassy says last night on tv the president of the united states said we don't negotiate with terrorists are you calling a president of the united states a liar and i remember thinking like alright so he probably said that and that's not on the document that he signed so i said look it you know i'm familiar with what he signed and it that's not what it says well you know and so the argument but that's always been the sound bite that everybody likes we don't negotiate with tariffs depends upon your definition of negotiation if it's just communication we negotiate with them all the time number one and number two like every president has made some boneheaded deal with the bad guys mhmm like obama released five high level taliban leaders from guantanamo in exchange for an awol soldier that we immediately threw in jail and i thought that was a horrible deal and that would that's putting terrorists back on the battlefield and then trump turned around and topped it by putting five thousand terrorists back on the battlefield so we haven't had a president that stick has stuck to that on either side of the aisle since people started throwing that out as a sound bite what do you think of that negotiation forget terrorists but the global negotiation like with with vladimir putin the recent negotiation over prisoners the exchange the britney geithner is there a way to do that negotiation successfully first of all i i agree with the idea that she was wrongfully detained and that she hadn't and she didn't deserve to be in jail and that us gov there should be no second class citizens ever and whether you're an m a wnba player or you're just some bonehead that walked into the wrong situation your government should not abandon you ever ever now what they do in the meantime there should have been a negotiation they were desperate to make a deal at a bad time they've been offered far better deals than prisoner swaps earlier and turned them down and then he gets turned up and thank god for brittney griner that the public got enough attention they kept pressure on the administration they made a deal now governments wanna make those kind of deals that's fine as long as it because that was basically a political negotiation you're putting five thousand taliban back on a battlefield that ain't negotiating with another government you're putting five of them back on a battlefield that ain't negotiating with another government that's directly contradicting this thing that you claimed and those were all bad deals now the was the brittney griner thing a bad deal i think it was great for her if i was in the middle of it it would have been better and she still would have come home yeah there's some technical aspects of that negotiation what do you think is the value just to linger on it of meeting in person for the negotiation i think it's a great idea can i just just follow that tangent along there's a war in ukraine now it's been going on over a year it's for me personally given my life stories is is a is a deeply personal one and i'm returning back to that area of the world that was there volodymyr zelensky said he doesn't wanna talk to to vladimir putin do you think they could get in a room together and say you were there in a room with putin and zelensky and biden is sitting in the back drinking a cocktail or maybe he is at the table participating how how is it possible through negotiation through the art of conversation to find peace in this very tense geopolitical conflict i think it's eminently possible i think the getting people together in person has always been a good idea now how many time who's getting them together under what circumstances and how many times you're getting them together the the documentary the human factor about the mideast peace negotiations mostly through the nineties mostly into the clinton administration got kicked off under bush forty one and then the documentary continues through trump but just touching basically on it but they're getting arafat and and the different israeli prime ministers together in person and these guys do not wanna talk to each other and depend upon the prime minister you know the the mere thought of being on the same planet with arafat was offensive and they started getting these guys together in parts and regularly and they started seeing each other as human beings yes and i started realizing that there was enough room on the planet for them and that people dying was stupid and they were and they would slowly work things out by getting these guys together in person so how long does it take who's hosting it but it's a good idea but the skill of achieving that thing that you talk about a lot which is empathy and i would say in that case not just empathy but empathy plus a bit you might disagree with this but a a drop of compassion in there i think compassion compassion is helpful but it's not essential like if if you just know where i'm coming from like it it it the thought the feeling of being understood yeah pardon and understood that's powerful is yeah and and again i know i picked the vast majority of this up on on andrew's podcast but i picked it up in other places because early on when we were putting a book together tal raz the writer my son uncredited coauthor so the book's really a collaboration between me my son brandon and and tal ross and we're driving for that's rights you know when somebody feels like what you've said is completely their position they say that's right not you're right but that's right so tal says you know i think i think what's happening here is you're triggering a subtle epiphany in somebody so i'm like alright i'll buy that so i start looking up the neuroscience of of the feeling of epiphany getting a hit of oxytocin and serotonin oxytocin is a bonding drug you bond to me i don't bond to you when you feel completely understood by me you bond to me then in one of the relationship podcasts that i'm listening to on on andrew it says oxytocin inclines people to tell the truth you're more honest alright so you feel deeply understood by me you bond to me mhmm and you start getting more honest with me serotonin the neurochemical satisfaction epiphany you feel oxytocin and serotonin being understood alright i got you bonding to me i got you being more honest with me and i got you feeling more satisfied so you want less what more do you want out of a negotiation of course there's already with leaders and great negotiators there's a walls built up defense mechanisms against that right there's you're resisting you're resisting this basic chemistry but yes you should have that you should work towards that kind of empathy and i i personally believe i i i don't actually understand why but i've observed it time and time again but getting in a room together and really talking whether privately or publicly but really talking and like this so i'll i'll i'll comment on this so right now this is being recorded and a few folks will hear this but when you really do a good job with this kind of conversation you forget there's cameras right and that's much better than there being even a third person in the room but often when world leaders meet there's like press or there's others in the room like as you know man to man or man to woman you have to like meet like in like in in a saloon just the two of you and talk there's some intimacy and power to that to achieve the the if you're also willing to couple that with empathy to really hear the other person yep yep yeah i don't know what that is that's like a deep deep intimacy that happens and i i think there's actually because we get asked this in a black swan group all the time like how do you know zoom that's bad you know because you don't have the same visual feedback on zoom yeah and that's not true like you and i i see you from the waist up right now if we're on zoom i'd be looking at you from the waist up i'm not wearing pants yeah with the internet i apologize for that sorry yeah yeah yeah you only see a a small portion usually i yeah that's usually where i go but anyway i'm glad we both have ridiculous energy i appreciate it but what makes us different in person i i actually think i think there's energy that we're unable we don't have the instrumentation to define yet and i think that there's a feel i think there's an actual energetic feel that changes and just because we don't we again just because we can't measure it doesn't mean it's not there yeah i would love to figure out what that is folks that are working on virtual reality are trying to figure out that what that is during the pandemic everybody was on zoom zoom and microsoft everybody was trying to figure out how do we replicate that i'm trying to understand how to replicate that because it sure is not fun to travel across the world just to talk to snowden or putin or zelensky you you i'd love to do it over zoom it's not the same it's not the same no it's not the same i'd go in a room with putin you would go in a room yeah thousand percent i get a that's right adam that's right well first you would give him a that's right probably getting a given there's a see see that and here's the issue that trips everybody up in negotiation the difference between hearing and speaking the same words are vastly different and what i'm looking for is what i'm the responses i'm getting out of you because if you if you can't first that's right especially like if you can't appreciate what that really means hearing it is unsatisfying so those two words are really important to you you talk about this in your book yeah what is why is that's what does that's right mean why is it important well it means that what you just heard you think is unequivocally the truth like it's dead on it hit the target it's it's a bull's eye and it's been a topic of discussion especially between my son and i a lot like what happens this oxytocin bonding moment and he his contention has always been like donald trump is the poster child of what it means because donald trump's an address in an audience you know he's he's in a debate with hillary or he's given a speech someplace and when the people that are devoted to him when they believe that he what he's just said is completely right it's insightful they look at him or they look at the tv and they go that's right and it's it's what people say when they're bought into what they just heard now if you're not convinced of the way that donald trump's followers are bonded to him and he he also just like this in my view destroys the idea of common ground because when he first started to run for president the pundits all said ah he's a new yorker nobody in the republican party is gonna like him him it's middle america you know it's blue collar you know it's regular common folks factory workers they're not gonna like trump because he's from new york and he went to wharton he's an ivy leaguer and he's a son of a wealthy real estate mogul and he had a million dollars handed to him when he got out of college he you know he's born with a silver spoon spoon in his mouth the rank and file republicans are never gonna accept this guy based on common ground look how look how smart that was do you think he's a good negotiator do you think donald trump is a good negotiator no i think he's a great marketer if you look at his negotiation track record alright so i started following donald trump in the eighties when i was in new york i'm a last century guy he's a last century guy we've got mutual acquaintances the minister that married him to mahler maples was a friend of mine and close friend of mine and in nineteen ninety eight i threw a fundraiser in his apartment at trump tower that he attended so no shortage of mutual friends we went to the same church still have mutual mutual acquaintances friends and i've watched his track record negotiation history which is exactly his track record with north korea where are we with north korea what was the deal that he made with north korea see your your answer is the same as everybody else's well i remember it started out with a lot of fanfare yeah but i don't know what happened because nothing ever happens it's more public fanfare so marketing minded presentation out with a bang if he doesn't cut the deal in a short period a really short period of time he moves on and everybody wonders what had happened because it was so much fanfare at the beginning now at the beginning him even opening that dialogue with north korea was masterful like i was i was such a fan when you got a president of the united states that is willing to sit down and talk with a leader of another nation when every other president all our advisers are saying the leader of north korea is beneath you you cannot dignify him by responding to him directly and consequently the trump administration inherits a can of worms that has been simmering for thirty years he didn't get a sense of that and he and he opened up a dialogue where nobody else was capable of opening a dialogue and then it just went away nobody knows what happened and there was no deal made now great negotiators make deals what do you think about these accusations that he's a narcissist the if you're a narcissist does that help you or hurt you is there a more popular term these days than narcissist every like everybody's a narcissist everybody you don't like is a narcissist like the homeless guy down on the corner he's a narcissist that's why he's there yeah it's lost meaning for you a little bit yeah and first of all most psychological terms as a hostage negotiator and really we were never into psychology and we steered away from it because psychology at best is soft science if it's not informed these days if it's not informed by real studies or neuroscience the guys that i'm impressed with these days psychologists neuroscientists now i wanna i'm i'm interested in that that that guy or gal but then psychology convention do you get them all together and they all agree no but also the interesting thing about psychology is each individual person is way more complicated than the category psychology tries to create and there's something about the human brain the moment you classify somebody as a narcissist or depressed or bipolar or insane in any kind of way for some reason you don't you you give yourself a convenient excuse not to see them as a complicated human being yeah to empathize with them i had that when i was talking to i i did an interview with kanye west and then there's a lot of popular opinions about him being mentally unwell and so on right and i felt that that kind of way of thinking is a very convenient way of thinking to ignore the fact that he's a human being that again wants to be understood and heard and that's the only way you can have that conversation yeah i agree completely that's right i feel so close to you now it might be because i'm not wearing pants alright so what were you're funnier than i am that bothers me alright i'll say something stupid soon enough don't worry about it but you said non we were talking about terrorists and nonnegotiating with terrorists is there something job going all the way back to where that rabbit hole started there's we're rabbit we're alice in wonderland right now the the the is there something about walking away of not negotiating is that is there power in that alright so it depends upon whether or not you're doing it with integrity or a tactic to start with and then also hostage negotiators are successful ninety three percent of the time kind of across the board which means that the seven percent of the time is gonna go bad and that was my old boss gary nesner i learned so much from gary but one of a phrase that he used over and over and over again until i finally worked the case and went bad was this is gonna be the best chance of success best chance of success and then something went bad and i remember thinking like well best chance of success is no guarantee of success so your question is are there negotiations you should walk away from if if you got no shot at success then then don't negotiate and there you have to accept the fact that some deals you never you're never gonna make you know we teach in my company it's not a sin to not get the deal it's a sin to take a long time to not get the deal mhmm and you know gary in his infinite wisdom you know they they realized that there was something called suicide by cop and that it might have gary was very much into clusters of behavior he kept us away from psychological terms and there would be clusters of behavior that would be high risk indicators and he and he wrote a block of instruction called high risk indicators which meant if you start seeing this stuff show up this thing's probably going bad and you're gonna need to you're gonna need to recognize that from the very beginning and adjust accordingly and it's the same way in in business and personal life i'm i'm talking to a head of a a marketing company i have tremendous respect for i admire that what this guy and his company does started from scratch he he borrowed space in a back of a drugstore to start his company and now it's hugely successful and he's laying out to me that he finally had to confront a potential client and walk away from him and he said how do you think i handle this my answer was thousand percent correct and as a matter of fact the behavior that he indicated he's a type and you should've walked away sooner than you did because this guy was playing you the whole time al qaeda two thousand four they're playing us they're not negotiating we need we called them out on it don't think you're negotiating they wouldn't say it exactly like that but that was that was absolutely the approach you know confront people on their behavior in a respectful way and signal that you're willing to walk away and mean it a thousand percent and mean it isn't that terrifying i mean it's scary because you don't want to really walk away or do you have to really want to walk away well this this gets core values your view of reality if it's an abundant world it's not scary to walk away if it's a finite world with limited opportunities then it's horrifying but you have to use that worldview to be willing to actually walk away yeah it could be walking away from a lot of money it could be walking away from something that's gonna hurt people because if you lose a hostage yeah well but if they're not gonna let the hostage out yeah suicide by cop they ain't letting them go the seven percent how do most negotiations fail the bad guys were never there to make a deal in the first place if if it was suicide by cop if they were there to if they're on a killing journey it's an israeli phrase if they're on a killing journey and the actions that they're currently engaged in are part of that killing journey killing journey is there advice you can give about you mentioned israel palestine the middle east taking on a few conversations on that topic is there hope for that part of the world and from that hope is there some advice you could lend yeah i think i think i think there's hope there's then i get friends on both sides and also when i got my after i left the fbi most people listen to this probably not gonna remember who rodney dangerfield was oh come on but he's a comedian doesn't get any respect yeah yeah yeah and and new yorker is he a new yorker i think he was a new yorker guy jersey or something yeah yeah and he he did a movie a long time ago called back to school he went back to school he was an old guy back to school so i went back to school after i left the fbi i did get a master's at harvard kennedy and that's where you know i'm running across people on both sides of that and when they could talk they said let's start from the premise that we both sides want a better life for our kids which is this version that i was telling you earlier from tom girardi let's pick a point in the future yeah that we're all happy with and he found that they could talk you know we alright so it might not be better for us how do we make it better for our kids and that that's where the the hope derives from because i think both sides ultimately want it to be better for their kids which is why they still engage in interactions and which is why i think the leadership regardless of how compromised they might be on either side there are few straight players in the game in the middle east or anywhere for that matter but they want a better future for their kids you get people who agree that you want a better future for your kids and then you start talking about well how do we work our way back from that and then alright so we got a mutual point in the future the israeli palestinian negotiations are also for me interesting because you mentioned clubhouse about almost two years ago now when israeli israel was shelling gaza they hit the upi office you know they were hitting they they got fed up with the rocket attacks from hamas and of course hamas is putting rockets in the upi office or the ap office whichever press office it was there how's that office gonna be there otherwise hamas is running a show you know you're not gonna run that office unless they let you unless you let them store weapons there that's just part of the game and and where are they gonna are they gonna storm in specially designated ammunition dumps no they're gonna put them in schools they're gonna put them in hospitals they're gonna put them in all places that when israel hits them they're gonna look really bad so after a while israel gets fed up they start shelling gaza and they're hitting these places friend of mine nicole benham is hosting rooms on clubhouse and she says you gotta come on the vitriol is killing me these are all turned into screaming matches nobody's talking to anybody i said alright cool we'll go on we'll we'll do it and and watch we won't have a single argument we'll invite people on from both sides the there was one rule before you started to describe what you thought of the other side you had to say before i disagree with you here's what i think your position is and you gotta continue to state the other side's position until they agree that you've gotten it now what happened no agreement and no arguments that was what we were really going for we wanted to show that people on both sides in one of their emotional time frames if your only requirement was you had to state the other side's position first nobody got out of control did it work that's exactly what happened not one we wanted to show people that you can have conversations that do not devolve into screaming matches with vitriol talking about how you're dedicated to the destruction of the other side just first see if you can outline where they're coming from that's really impressive because i've just having seen on clubhouse people which part of the reason i liked clubhouse you get to hear voices from all sides they were emotionally intense right they it was i mean i was i'm i'm sweating just in the buildup of your story here i thought it's gonna go could could go to hell but you're saying it kinda worked to make it person lost control now the of the two sides the people that were speaking on behalf of the israelis were a little better yeah at articulating supportive positions for the palestinians most of the people who wanna speak up on behalf of the palestinians they just they they they wanna start in like you're doing this and i'd say no no no no you can go there just not yet mhmm before you go there you can say that all you want before you do go there you've gotta try to articulate to them where they're coming from they gotta tell you got it right and what would consistently happen is there's a leveling out of a person to try to see the other side's perspective and articulate it it's enormously beneficial to the person who's trying to do it which was really the point that we're trying to make it's a really interesting exercise i mean that that by way of advice so if it works at clubhouse for people who don't know that's a sort of a voice app where you can be anonymous so it's really regular people but regular people who can also be anonymous it's just it could be chaos if it works there that's really interesting for when you sit down for a conversation across the table from somebody don't have them even steal me on the other side have them just state the other side just yeah just your explain your understanding of it yeah that's it and every now and then i would jump in like you know and there's somebody supporting israel you know whoever the heck they were and they'd they'd say a couple things and the palestinian guy would be like our gal or supportive of them would say you know you missed some stuff and i'd say let me jump in first of all i know what the nakba is the nakba is a catastrophe mhmm that's the day israel was born you you know for the rest of the world it's the birth of israel fused to nakba i said you've got members of your family that is still walking around carrying keys to the front door of the house they abandoned and he'd be like yeah and i'd say you feel bad that in point of fact that in world war two the world stood back and watched while the nazis threw the jews off a building the only problem was they landed on you and they'd be like yeah that's where they're coming from so articulating you know deeply what the other side feels is transformative for both people involved in a process what's the toughest negotiation you've ever been a part of or maybe observed or heard of what's a difficult case you just stands out to you or maybe just one one of many well the the stuff we went through with al qaeda in and around iraq iraq and saudi first one was in saudi in two thousand four time frame the hardest part about that was working with family members and not deceiving them about the possibility of the outcome yeah how do you talk to family members is that part of the negotiation yeah empathy learning empathy the hard way and then being able to take it up to to higher levels because at its base level a guy that we're working with now that's coaching us in eos and is a business partner his name is jonathan smith he pointed out to us that there's kinda there's a shuhari concept have you are you familiar with shuhari it's a martial arts concept and shuh is do it exactly as the master is telling you to do it wax on wax off credit kid stuff mhmm is when you've done the repetition repetitions enough times you're getting a feel for it and you begin to see the same lessons coming from other masters you're seeing the same thing show up in other places and at the re level you're still in the discipline but you're making up your own rules it's almost a flow state mhmm and you don't realize that you're making up your own rules and if somebody asks you where you learn that you probably say i you know my my sensei taught it to me my master taught it to me this will come back around the negotiating with families pretty quick we did this once because there there's a bunch of people that we coach business people that are scared of the amount of money that they're losing if we're not coaching them regularly one of these guys michael we're interviewing him for a social media posting about two years ago and michael says yeah you know you gotta gather data with your eyes and i remember and i went oh i like that i said where did you hear that before he goes you know i don't know i heard it from you i think and i was like no no no no i don't remember saying that yeah for at that first time i've heard that he's in re so what's this got to do with families empathy at its base level and the shoe level i learned it on the suicide hotline is saying like you sound angry i'm just calling out the elephant in the room your your emotions what's driving you i'm throwing a label on your affect and i'm saying you sound or it sounds like you are because that's the basic karate kid wax on wax off approach now there are a lot of hostage negotiators that'll tell you empathy doesn't work at home home not true they've never gotten out of shoe mhmm you're getting ready to talk to your significant other and you wanna go someplace that you know is gonna make her angry you wanna go do something now that's real negotiation right there you could say to her you sound angry in in which case she's gonna blow up because her reaction is you made me angry bozo how do can you act like you're an innocent third party or that you were independent of how i feel bad and you learn learn a little bit more and you say the the high level is is probably gonna make you angry and then what i did with families i knew how they felt before i walked in the door i knew that they were scared to death you find out that your your your husband your father your brother has been grabbed by al qaeda who are in the business of chopping people's heads off you're gonna be horrified i can't walk into them and go like you sound angry of course i'm angry you idiot but knowing what they are i used to walk into family's houses and i'd say i know you're angry now what do now what do the circumstance dictate that they should also feel they're gonna feel abandoned by their government they're gonna feel totally alone they're gonna be scared and they're gonna be angry because they feel the government abandoned them now they're in point of fact is this an accurate statement that their loved one voluntarily went into a war zone and voluntarily went someplace their government told them not to go are the facts that the government abandoned them absolutely not as a matter of fact the government warned tried to get them to not go and they went anyway but that doesn't change how they felt in the moment and i i'd walk into a house and i go i know you're angry i know you feel abandoned and alone and i know you're horrified and i know you feel the united states government has abandoned you and they would look at me and go like yeah what do we do now now we're ready to rock is there with al qaeda or in general is there a language barrier too it could be just barriers of different communication styles i mean you got like a new yorker way about it that might make somebody from like i don't know laguna beach uncomfortable do you is do you feel that language barrier in communication is that language and communication style in itself creating a barrier but you got a a barrier when you think that your way is the way sure that's the biggest barrier yeah like and and that happens all the time when people talk about what about cross cultural negotiations you know what hand do i gotta shake hands with sure so that i can get my way mhmm well if you strip it all down we're all we're all basically the same blank slate when we were born we got a everybody's got a limbic system everybody's limbic system works pretty much the same way people are driven by the same sorts of decisions how does this affect my future what am i at risk of losing how how does this affect my identity you know caught a kidnapper you're a new york city businessman you're a tobacco farmer in the south all making those same same decisions based on those same things so as soon as i start to navigate that and i tailor my approach which is what empathy is to what you think how you see things so i can be the biggest goofball ever from if you live in the south yeah maybe i'm a new yorker or or i'm somebody from la or somebody from chicago but my geography is foreign to you but as soon as i start dialing in on how you see things suddenly you're listening what about the three voices you talk about the different voices you can use in that communication right the assertive voice direct and honest i'm a natural born assertive natural born i thought we're all blank slate you're born well that's it's like nah stop catching me on what i said how dare you throw accuse me of what i've said to quote bono i stand accused of what i've said the things i've said that's a good line he's got he's got a few good lines yeah so assertive voice you're born that way which one what are the other ones analyst mhmm you're an analyst and i could tell you're assertive yeah what's an analyst voice well an analyst is close the the smarter just to go more thoughtful no as a matter of fact look you you ever do a decision tree yeah see you like it too don't you so decision trees you know they're the i'm a computer scientist so the way i've i like mathematical systematic ways of seeing the world he's an analyst you think donald trump would ever say that unlikely wait is he more the assertive kind he's a natural born assertive yeah yeah are all new yorkers like this is this somewhat something in the water or no it's a crazy thing i mean there's an affect that a city can have yeah and you know new york's northeast not just new york but the northeast is is a little more the the the affect yeah of the area of the cult culture of the area the individuals individuals still boil down into the three types across the board what's the third one accommodator smiling optimistic hopeful yeah the i'm a hundred a thousand percent convinced that the phrase hope is not a strategy is designed at people's frustration over a third of the population being accommodators that are hope driven i hope this works out and they're very relationship they on the surface they're very relationship oriented they're they tend to appear to be very positive and they are but it's really built around hope and the idea is you can adopt these three voices when you can yeah you can learn them they're all learnable the analysts are often mistaken for combinators mhmm because as you said before you know analysts are more introspective more analytical they're looking at the systems at work and if if they like to learn they notice that accommodators make more deals than they make they also notice that there's a higher failure rate of the deals but since they notice stuff and they think about it they catch on faster than assertives do that the pleasant nature of an of an accommodator contributes strongly to them making deals like my daughter-in-law is an analyst you know another another descriptor we have in that an analyst are assassins mhmm you know an analyst will snipe you from a thousand yards out in the middle of the night and you never know what hit you and they're and they're really happy with that but has how has assertiveness the assertive voice served you in negotiation poorly the assertive voice is almost always counterproductive it feels like getting hit in the face with a brick and that's almost always counterproductive so for me to be more effective especially in a negotiation i'll need to slow slow down and smile you know i heard that teddy roosevelt was a good negotiator and that he was extremely stubborn and perhaps the right term for that would be assertive but he picked his battles is there some value to holding strong to principles so i don't even know if that's probably the opposite of empathy are there times when you can just stick be extremely stubborn to your principles to one of our negotiations do it all the time we just you know we're just nice about it okay it helps to be nice you're saying well yes because i need you to hear me and the assertive tone of voice so when when we do our training typically we do an exercise called sixty seconds or she dies mhmm and i play the bad guy bank robber and i ask you to be the hostage negotiator and your job is to i'll give you the four cons real world constraints and then you're gonna try and negotiate me out of the bank now we're doing this now the first voice that i always use in that exercise is the assertive voice which is the commanding voice it's the voice that all police officers have talked to use in the street issue loud and clear commands you know it doesn't it to me i don't feel like i'm attacking you i just feel like i'm being direct and honest and clear mhmm you on the other hand feel attacked now we're doing this exercise in austin a couple of years ago the first participant has an apple watch on mhmm he tells us afterwards that sitting still not even answering when he first gets hit in the face with the assertive voice his heart rate jumped to one seventy which is a typical fight or flight reaction i come at you like i'm fighting you your your fight flight mechanisms all kick into gear which clouds your thinking you're automatically dumber in the moment mhmm so if i wanna make a great long term deal with you highly profitable i'm agnostic to you being profitable if you'd be profitable that's fine i'm i'm here to make money for me me making you dumber will always hurt me me making you feel attacked will always hurt me so there's never a value in being in you making me afraid there's never a long term value in it that's it's another thing that tal ross when we were writing a book braced me on because he said there's scientific data out there that's called strategic umbrage well there's data well whether or not it's scientific i would call that into question but he said there's studies out there that show that strategic umbrage works and another thing that i also enjoy you probably get tired of me saying wonderful things about andrew he talked there's never there's never enough wonderful things to say about the great andrew huberman the host of the huberman lab podcast that everybody should subscribe to you should talk to andrew huberman funnier than he is though i'll give you that hear that answer he's he's funny accidentally he makes me laugh all the time not when he's trying to be funny he's a really he's one of the people in this world that's truly legit he's a really strong scientist and a really strong communicator and a good human being and it those those together don't come often and then it's nice to see yeah yeah yeah yeah he's a treasure national treasure anyway you were saying well he he he sort of taught me how to think about data and studies and science and and also from different books that he's turned me on to he's really helped me think about this stuff so the studies about strategic umbrage were done the ones that i've seen that show it's effective there were simulated negotiations with college students now here's the problem with that a simulated negotiation with a college student college students are gonna sit down as part of their assignment they're gonna sit down one time they're gonna sit down for forty five minutes and they're gonna think that if they didn't come to a deal at all that they failed mhmm and there's no ongoing implementation there's just the deal and then they walk away of a pretend situation so so they got no actual real skin in the game there's no deal on earth to sit down and come to agreement forty five minutes and never see each other again because there's the implementation of the deal if it even if it's only payment so the data is flawed based on the way it was collected it's a highly flawed study and all data is flawed as you know as a scientist you just gotta be aware what the flaws are and decide whether or not that destroys the study or or what do you think you take a look at the data there's no such thing as perfect data look at the data see what you think of it the data that says that strategic umbrage works is based on flawed circumstances can you explain strategic umbrage getting mad scaring the other side into a deal getting mad at using anger strategically to bully the other side into an agreement that's nice to hear in some sense it's nice to hear that empathy is the right way in almost all situations it's nice best chance of success not that it works every time just so it works more than anything else does what is the technique of mirroring there's a lot of cool stuff in your book they just kinda jump around what's mirroring mirroring is is like it's it's it's one of the most fun skills because it's the simplest to execute you just repeat one to three ish words of what somebody said usually the last one to three words what i found about it is the people that really like mirroring love it because it's so simple and so effortless and invisible they typically for lack of a better term tend to be both high iq and high eq like i'm not a high iq guy i'm i'm an average dude i like to think that i can learn in eq emotional intelligence is a skill you can build and i'm always working on building it mhmm but a lot of really regular average people will be like mirroring that's stupid i'm not doing that and i don't know why they don't like it but when i find somebody that loves to mirror i'll always ask them you know how'd you i just go on i iq and typically their iq is pretty high now i don't know why that combination attracts people to marrying because there's there's nine skills eight from hostage negotiation and we then the ninth really was tone of voice and we just define that as a skill and each one is different and focuses on different components of the conversation and a lot of people don't like to mirror they found it so awkward like i i don't particularly i'm not particularly strong in mirroring i gotta do it intentionally i'm good at labeling but does it almost always work oh yeah yeah it's it feels maybe awkward but there's it's true there's gotta be ways to signal that you're truly listening that's part of it i i think you can do body language you can yeah there there's a lot of ways to signal that but mirroring is probably just this trivial little hack it kinda is i you know what there's a situation i i had a conversation with stephen kotkin he's this historian and he would say my name a lot throughout the conversation he would be like well you have to understand lex is that and for some reason that was making me feel really good i was like he cares about me and i wonder if that key if everyone has that key that could be name just using people's name could be powerful using the name is really context driven mhmm it can be extremely powerful with someone who's genuine and it comes across in their demeanor and it's used in a way that you can tell is meant to encourage you yeah as opposed to exploit you sure and the people that are really into exploiting will also use it and do the same thing so you have to be you have to avoid using the things that people that are exploiters manipulators use because it's it might signal to others that this person is trying to trick me gotta be very conscious of it yeah what's labeling that you mentioned the thing you like well it's you know i said earlier that that old progression from you sound angry to this is probably gonna make you angry to i know you're angry labeling is is hanging a label on an emotion or an affect and then just calling it out is that almost always good because could it be a source of frustration when a person is being angry and you you kinda put a label on it call out the elephant the is it possible that that will lead to escalation of that feeling versus a resolution well the con what would make it bad like if i'm pointing out like that blatantly obvious like if i say look i need you to get up and go down to the bank and make the deposit let's say i'm talking to my somebody who works in my company mhmm i need you to get on the phone with this person and make the appointment and they go sounds like you want me to talk to this person yes that would be annoying if it's just so so absurdly obvious yeah that there's no insight in your label at all and as as soon as you're demonstrating an awareness or a subtlety or an insight either to you or to them now we're making progress so the only time a label could ever potentially be counterproductive is like if you weren't actually listening yeah and the label is indicates that you're not listening you know i'm teaching at usc and i'm teaching labels and you know one of the kids in a class he just wants to take the skills and make his deals and just hustle them yeah and he's just looking for a hustle yeah so he writes up a a paper about you know he goes there's some some malls i think over by palm springs or some place some outlet malls a lot of people go to buy suits so he goes in there and he immediately starts the bargaining that my book teaches with no empathy and he's like throws a price to the guy and the guy's like no and he throws another price to the guy and the guy's like no and then then he says to the the guy behind the counter sounds like we can make a deal like no it doesn't i just shot down everything you just said if anything it sounds like we're never gonna make a deal yeah but he tried to use this label for manipulation now the guy didn't get mad on the other side but it's like clearly this dude is not listening to me and at the core of everything you you have a bunch of like you know almost like hacks like techniques you can use but at the core of it is empathy at the core of it is empathy yeah that's the main thing you'd be able to just sit there and listen and perceive yeah and look for insights you know what i like silence or like you're both sitting there chilling with a drink looking up at the stars there's a moment the silence makes you kinda zoom out and realize you're in this together as opposed to playing a game or some kinda like chess game of a negotiation you're in it together i don't know there's some intimacy to the silence and like if i i'll ask a question and just let the other person sit there in silence before they answer or the vice versa they ask me a question i sit there in silence that's a it's a big it feels like a big intimate thing yes and the other two types until they've experienced that are afraid of it and what i'm actually gonna do is for whatever reason i'm really i'm really comfortable with silence i think because i've i've experienced its effectiveness and also my son brandon like he's a king of dynamic silence mhmm like he he coaches people he says you go silent count thousands to yourself don't stop till you run out of numbers it's a good line he's also good full of good lines he is that is and so there's so much to it but the other two types are natural wiring against the white until they've experienced it and you know your gut instinct intuition's giving you data once you've experienced it yeah but your amygdala is kicking into gear again sorry i realize it's more complicated than that until you've experienced it so accommodators hope based how do they signal fury the silent treatment so when you go silent they're scared to death you're furious yeah because that's how they indicate it the assertive thinks that you as the analyst went silent because you want them to talk some more when a point of fact you either you're thinking or and i i love your description the feeling of intimacy and silence and experiencing the moment because i'm actually gonna factor that into trying to get the accommodators love shared intimacy they love would love to experience a moment and i can see that being very compelling than be willing to cross that chasm and experience silence and see how see how it works for them yeah it's nerve racking which is why it's intimate because you start thinking what's the other person thinking we're actually gonna do this are we gonna sit here for ten seconds and count i mean there's tricks to it i guess like brandon says is to could just count it out and realize through data that there's intimacy to it i had a a friend of mine he lost his voice because he's singing so he couldn't the doctor said he can't talk for a week just to to heal the voice yeah the the vocal cords but he he hung out with other people with friends and didn't talk to them he just hung out uh-huh and he said he was really intimate they both they both didn't talk to each other they just sat there and enjoyed time together i don't know it's it's a it's a wake up call it's a thing to try maybe with with people in your life just hang out and don't say anything like as an experiment don't say anything the entire day but hang spend or try yeah definitely it's interesting i haven't tried it myself it seems it's kinda like a silent retreat but more active as part of like regular everyday life anyway the is there other other interesting techniques we can talk about here so for example creating the illusion of control yeah it's principally you know by asking what and how questions because people love to tell others what to do or how to do it it does a lot that was that was really the way when the book was first written that we really thought about what and how questions it's giving the other side the illusion of control and there's a lot more to it than that that we've discovered i mean it triggers deep thinking it wears people down deep thinking is could be exhausting and you want so what's what's the role of exhaustion in negotiation is that ultimately one you gotta be careful with that some people exhaust intentionally one of my negotiation heroes a guy now who's unfortunately suffering from dementia and alzheimer's john domenico pico is the un hostage negotiators that got got all the western hostages out of beirut in the eighties and he wrote a book called man without a gun and acquainted with johnny at this point in time i think i don't think he has any memory of who i am at all but he writes in his book one of the great secrets of negotiation is exhausting the other side political negotiations that could be johnny was very deferential it was in the middle of in in the eighties leading up to about nineteen eighty six ish every negotiation involving warring parties in the middle east that you can imagine he was in cyprus he was in afghanistan iraq and iran the iranian government had tremendous trust in him as a westerner a representative of the un got all the westerners out of out of beirut and he was just ridiculously patient and then which the other side found exhaust would often find exhausting so exhaustion is can be a component of finding resolution in negotiation if it's if it tamps down the negative emotions often exhaustion will tamp down negative emotions if it puts you if if it and getting the real trick is really getting negative emotions out out of out of the way because you're dumber in a negative frame of mind so the goal is always positive emotion as you talk about that's what you're always chasing together i think i think so yeah and that's what the that's right is about yes it's like whatever you're triggering whatever the chemistry you're triggering in your brain like yeah yeah we're doing good here i think so long term for long term success absolutely how's the word fair used and abused bomb the f bomb as you call it how's it used and abused in negotiation it's usually used it's most frequently used as a weapon it's abused as a point of manipulation it's what people say when they feel backed into a corner and they can't come up with any legitimate reason as to why they're being backed into a corner like nobody uses the word f the f bomb nobody uses the word fair when they've got criteria to back them up mhmm so consequently when somebody start starts dropping it you gotta realize the other side's got no legitimate outside criteria they're they're feeling very vulnerable they can't explain it but they feel defensive and it saying hey look i've just i've given you a fair offer is a way for me to knock you off your game if you're if you're not not aware of it so a lot of cutthroat negotiations negotiators are gonna use it on you to knock you off your game the the nfl strike probably now it's been a good ten years ago and maybe even longer than that one of these sticking points was the owners were not opening their books to the players players wanna see the numbers and in order to not open their books they just sent a rep held a press conference saying we've given them players a fair offer mhmm well if it was fair you'd open your books yeah if if you gave them a fair offer and it was justified by what was in your books you'd open them to prove your point so what ends up happening though that well the owners gave the players a fair offer starts to get picked up in the media mhmm and then it starts getting repeated and now now there are different people on the player's side are going like yeah maybe maybe they have given us a fair offer it caused people to be insecure about their own positions it's an enormously powerful word that can be used and abused and it almost always comes up in every negotiation it's shocking the number of times it comes up with people who don't really understand how or why it's coming up so usually it's a signal of of a not a good place in the in negotiation without question i'm completely convinced that if the person is using the word as a means of getting what they want then either accidentally or on purpose either in their gut or they know they gotta pay a position or their gut is afraid that they are do i use a word what i'll say is i want you to feel like i've treated you fairly and if even any given point in time you think i'm not treating you fairly i want you to stop me and we're gonna address it big ridiculous question but how do you close the deal how do you take the negotiation to its end is implementation ultimately you gotta you gotta pivot to agreed upon implementation to to really move out in out of the negotiation and i may say how how do you how do you wanna proceed and if you don't know i might say no one to question is it a ridiculous idea if i share with you some ideas of how to proceed and then you agree on the actual steps and that's the implementation it's not just the philosophical agreement it's actual steps the big problem in all negotiations is a lack of discussion of next steps that's deep who's the best negotiator you've ever met yeah actually probably my son brandon yeah yeah he's ridiculously talented i mean he's ridiculously talented and he yeah he's you know and what was it coyle's book the culture the telecode says that you know people just noticed it and started getting good at it there's no such thing as a child prodigy just got interested when they were a kid i mean brandon started learning how to negotiate when he was two years old and he's been in it and immersed in it you know since he can make complete sentences even before he can make complete sentences he's ridiculously talented what's what's his future what's he want to do he's gonna he has been involved he's he run and built my company and now he's gonna be an affiliated licensee run his own operation he's pretty he's pretty much gonna end up doing very much he's gonna open his entrepreneurial opportunities to do whatever he wants and not have his dad say no and do a better job than his dad most likely yeah okay do you see some of the techniques that you talk about as manipulative manipulation is whether or not i'm trying to exploit you hurt you am i trying to manipulate a bank robber into letting me save his life yeah so manipulation is like what am i what am i trying to do to you yeah so but so you don't see the negative connotation if you're trying to bring a better future it's not manipulation stop if i'm trying to bring a better future if i'm being genuine and honest like i compliment you yeah if if my compliment is genuine that's not manipulation like but but you know if i think you know you're you got a pair of shoes that that are the dumbest looking things i've ever seen mhmm and i go wow those are great shoes nah that's manipulation so there's there's guys like warren buffett who are big on integrity and honesty what's the role of lying in effective lying is just a bad idea lying is just a bad idea for a variety of reasons first of all there's a really good chance the other side is a better liar than you are they're gonna spot it right off the bat yeah secondly they could be luring you into a trap to see if you will lie thirdly the chances are they're gonna find out that you lied to them eventually is really high and then the penalties and the taxes are gonna be way higher than what you had in the in the first place so long term you wanna have a reputation of somebody with integrity and the more you lie the harder it is to maintain that reputation yeah exactly and and words gonna get out yeah so what's the we can just return to that question what's the difference between a good conversation and a good negotiation can we because i think just reading your work listening to you there's a sense i have that the thing we're doing now and just conversation on podcast and so on is different than negotiation it feels like the purpose is different and yet having some of the same awareness of the value of empathy is extremely important but it feels like the goals are different or no really close fine line i mean i you know i i ruled in here not having any expectations not looking for anything other than having an interesting conversation and to hear what was behind the questions that you're asking me and what interests you and then also your description of silence and the power of silence something i'm gonna take away is a is a learning point and help learn to teach others but i ain't come in here i suppose a negotiation is when we're both aware of a problem we're trying to solve right there's no problem in the room right just to solve except maybe like the human condition and insight you know wisdom insight learn how do you train to become better in negotiating in business in in life yeah just small stakes practice for high stakes results i mean decide what what kinda negotiating resonates with you i mean what's that mean small stakes practice for high stakes or small so small little incremental like picking up girls at a bar what are we talking about well it can be for some people that's that's high stakes practice well you know label labeling labeling mirrors what are the basic tools of great negotiation labeling mirror and paraphrasing summarizing so you start you start labeling and mirror people that you're just having regular interactions with just to gain a feel for whether or not you can read somebody's affect or how accurate your read is to get better at it and so you know label the the lyft driver mhmm or the grocery store clerk or a person behind the airline counter at the at the airport so putting a label on their affect or throwing something at them that because negotiation is a parables perishable skill emotional intelligence is perishable so seeing if you can indicate that you understand their label one of my favorite labels to throw out on somebody which you know maybe relevel i might look at somebody who looks distressed and i'll go tough day mhmm so several years ago at the counter at lax well i'm waiting in line to get to the counter and a lady behind the counter is clearly making it a point to not meet my eyes so that i don't approach mhmm and she looks and so like you you know you know when you're next in line and they're making sure that you don't meet eyes mhmm and i'm thinking to myself alright so they're having a bad day so i walk up and as soon as i approach the counter i go tough day and she kinda snaps around and she goes no no no how can i help you mhmm and goes out of her way to help me mhmm now i'm practicing but i also know it made her feel better it relieved some of the stress so now i'm going through tsa wanna look for for people who are having a tough day it's a good place to find them it's a good place to find and practice and i'm and i'm rolling through the line and i realized i haven't tossed a label out on any one of these guys and and there's this guy watching the bags come out of the x-ray machine he's just kinda got an in indifferent look on his face and i go tough day and he kinda goes i could see from his body language like no and i go just another day and he goes yeah just another day mhmm you know he felt seen but i missed and i'm practicing mhmm and i'm trying to stay sharp so these are the few words with just a few words you're trying to like quickly localize the effect and then live on it very very very analytically said thank you i'm not letting it go i love it it does the same apply to just conversation in general just how to get better at conversation i think a lot of people struggle they have insecurities they have anxiety about conversation i as funny as this to say i have a lot of anxiety about conversation is that it it basically do the same kind of practice practice some of the techniques in both genuinely just trying to make sure you heard somebody out yeah what's the best conversation you ever been in except this one of course wow what what are the i mean not the best conversation but what stands out to you as conversation that changed you as a person maybe well there's there's probably been a lot of them along the way i mean but one one that one that that i remember on a regular basis there's well actually there's two but when i was in the bureau i'm i'm at quantico i'm their finance services another guy from new york a buddy of mine named lionel and we're both trying to decide whether or not we wanna be try to get into profiling or negotiation because they're both about human dynamics and both of us really like human dynamics mhmm and we're sitting around talking about it and we're talking about several things and and he labels me and i i know he didn't know what he was doing i think i think he was just he had picked it up and i'd been talking about my family quite a few things and he said to me and i never said this directly that we were close but he said to me it sound like your family is really close and i can remember in the moment like this feeling mhmm just like i felt great in the moment i mean what he said just drew together everything that i've been saying and nailed the essence of it and i have a very clear recollection of how good that felt in the moment so a couple years later i'm on a suicide hotline now i got i got this line in the back of my head you know line technique reaction read whatever you wanna call it guy calls in on a hotline and i could tell the dude is rattled by his tone of voice i mean just just amped up and he goes you know i'm just trying to put a lid on the day i need i need your help putting a lid on the day i gotta i gotta put a lid on the day and i go you you sound anxious and he goes he goes yeah and i and and it came down a little bit and it it was a guy that was he was telling me about he was battling the disease disease of paranoia and he's gonna go on a car trip with his family the next day and he knew that on the car trip he was gonna you know twist himself in the knots and so the night before he's twisted himself in the knots and he's laying out everything that he's done to try to beat paranoia and how much his family's helping him and and he's going on a car trip with the family because they're gonna take him to see a doctor and he and so i i hit him with the same thing that my buddy lionel said i said sounds like your family's close he goes yeah we are close and he leveled out a little bit more and then he started ticking off all the things that he was doing to try to be paranoid and he sounded determined and so i said you sound determined and he goes yeah i am determined i'll be fine tomorrow thanks and that was all i said so those two conversations which are overlapping conversations those two things really stick out of my mind do those things like through all the different negotiations and conversations you've had do you do they kinda echo throughout like you basically because when you empathize with other human beings you start to realize we're all the same and so you can start to pick little phrases here and there that you've heard from others little experiences they were all about like we all want to be to be close with other human beings we all we all want love we're all i think we're all deeply lonely inside looking for connection we're just if we're we're if we're honest about it and so all humans have that same all the same different components of or it makes them tick so you you kind of see yourself basically just saying the same things to connect with another human being yeah there aren't there aren't that many different things that we're looking for understanding on or connection on or satisfaction of there just aren't that many of them regardless and so yeah you're you're looking for to manifest itself in some form or another and you're willing to take a guess on whether or not that's what you're seeing or hearing what advice would you give to me to be better at these conversations to me and to other people that do kinda interviews and podcasts and so on wow because i i really care about empathy as as well is there a kind of as a lifelong journey in this process yeah well i i think i would advise you to take that approach which is the approach that you're taking you care about it you're very curious about it you see it as a lifelong journey you're fascinated by it you enjoy learning about it and and you definitely do see it as a lifelong journey as opposed to this is what i can if i can acquire this then i can manipulate people no i mean i i i fall in love with people i talk to there's a kinda deep connection and it lingers with you especially when i'm preparing the more material there's in a person the more you get to fall in love with them ahead of time they they you you get to really understand not understand but what i mean by fall in love is well appreciate appreciate but also become deeply curious that's what i mean by fall in love like yeah you appreciate the things you know but you start to see like alice in wonderland you start to see that there's all this cool stuff you can learn if you keep interacting with them and then when you show up and you actually meet you realize it's like more and more and more and more it's like in physics the more you learn the more you realize you don't know and it's like it's really exciting and then it could also be heartbreaking because you have to say goodbye goodbye i hate goodbyes i hate goodbyes seems total right yeah it makes it reminds me that i'm gonna die one day like things end good things end it sucks but then it makes the the moment more delicious you know that you do get to spend together yeah okay i i just wanna i completely forgot i wanted to ask you about this the seven thirty eight fifty five percent rule this is really interesting does this is there an all truth to it that seven percent of a message is conveyed from the words used thirty eight percent from the tone of voice and fifty five percent from body language is that really true to that alright so albert morabian i think is the name of the ucla professor that originally proposed a sum of thirty eight fifty five ratio and discussed it in terms of that it wasn't the message but how much the he called it liking mhmm like are you not that you're the meaning is coming across but you're liking of the message and so that's been extrapolated heavily by people like me to this meaning of the meaning in seven thirty eight fifty five from liking to the meaning what i've seen regularly is people that communicate verbally if they're speakers tony robbins seven thirty eight fifty five guy he he throws the ratio out there go that's it exactly that's exactly how the message comes across this is how we gotta balance it this is how we gotta do it those that communicate principally in writing the meaning of the words are much more important to them mhmm so they're deeply uncomfortable with seven being the words because the content the words the meaning of the words when you're writing it's so important that you you hate to poo poo it that way yeah so i i i first of all i thousand percent believe it's an accurate ratio but the real critical issue is not what the ratio of those three things are it's what's what's the message when they're out of line like what's the message when the tone of voice is out of line with the words like it don't matter what your ratio is you got a problem if their tone does not match their words and that's that's hard to really put put a measure on exactly even in writing there's a tone i mean it's not just yep even in writing it's not just the words there's the words but there's like a style underneath the whole thing right and there's something like body language the presentation of the whole thing i mean there yeah yeah i'm a big fan of constraint mediums of communication which writing is or voice like clubhouse there's a personality to a human being when you just hear their voice like that there's it's not just it's you could say it's the tone of voice but there's a you can like what is it the imagination fills in the rest like when i'm listening to somebody i'm like i'm imagining some amorphous being right doing things when they get angry i'm imagining anger i don't know what exactly i'm visualizing if you're if well and so you you may be thinking of a funny story because we were talking about your buddy elon before yeah and i told you you know about you know that i'd interacted with some of the senior executives so i know that they that they that that that they love working with him and i think he's an interesting guy and they realized that he can be funny and he jokes around yeah so that that tell me during this conference call just words and a guy on the other end of the line says something you know that wasn't wasn't was wrong but wasn't bad yeah and so they said they're on a they're on a phone and elon goes you're fired and then everybody in the room with him can see that he's joking yeah but the person on the other side can't and they all go to work wait wait wait wait they can't see your look on your face right now you gotta stop you gotta stop because the the guy on the other side is dying right now he doesn't realize you're joking yeah so there was you know there were the words and the tone of voice and but it lacked the visual to go with it nevertheless it was probably funny i'm sure it was very funny at the time maybe not to him just just as interesting chad gpt there's just more more and more sophisticated and effective and impressive chatbots essentially they can they can talk and they are becoming more and more human like right do you think it's possible in the future that ai will be able to be better negotiators than humans do you think about that kind of stuff well so definition of better or or versus less flawed like they're they're you know they're they're chatbots have been out there for a long time and probably about five years ago now a company approached us because they were doing a negotiation chatbot and they said two things first first of all i said you know why are you talking to us so well in point of fact we already spoke to the people that are teaching quote the harvard methodology mhmm and you know the rational approach to negotiation just doesn't work rational approach just does not work it's our chatbots are not getting anywhere but we're showing in in around about eighty percent of the interactions a higher success outcome with these chatbots and they showed me what they were doing and it was still a lot deeply flawed emotional intelligence wise but the reason why that they were having higher success rates is the chatbots were never in a bad mood and you could reach out for chatbot in the middle of the night so if you're talking to somebody that was never upset and was always available then you're gonna have a higher success rate negotiations go bad when people are in a negative frame of mind so the pot the the natural ability of a chatbot to be positive is just going to give you a higher success rate yeah and and they're not they're not gonna get mad and argue with you you know you you say you say to a chatbot you know your price is too high chatbot is designed to come back with a smiley face yeah you say to a person your price is too high they go how dare you i'm trying to make a living you know they they could go off the deepest unfortunately or fortunately i think the way chat bots are going no they will come back negative because they're becoming more human more and more human like that's the whole point right to be able to pass the turing test you have to be negative you have to be an asshole you have to have boundaries you have to be insecure you have to have some uncertainty well it's them between being having boundaries and being negative like i can like you you throw a proposal at me you know before i say no i'm gonna say look i'm sorry that just doesn't work for me i'm gonna set up a real clear boundary without being negative sure so and a lot of people really struggle with setting boundaries without being negative without name calling without indignation without getting upset but see there's a when you are when you show that you're not getting upset i'm not just seeing that i'm seeing a flaw i'm seeing a flawed human that has underneath it a temper underneath it the ability to get upset right but chooses not to get upset and a chatbot has to demonstrate that so it's not just going to be cold and and you know be this kind of corporate blank empty sort of like vapid creature that just says oh thank you thank you for saying that no it's basically you have to the chatbot has to be able to be mean and choose not to be interesting i don't know maybe that i'd be i'd i'd be willing to to see that play out and see see how it plays out but i guess what i'm saying is to be a good negotiator you have to be have the capacity to be a bad person and choose not really i think so i've got see i i think you just gotta have the capacity to set a boundary and stick to it interesting i because i think it's hard for me to trust a person who's not aware of their their own demons because if you say you don't have any demons if you don't have any flaws i can't trust you yeah well it's first of all it's a lie right so somebody's lying right this is it gives back the lie yes so you have to have a self awareness about that but you'd be able to control it and demonstrate to be able to control it i mean this is humans i just think humans intelligent effective humans are able to do this well and chatbots are not yet and they're moving that direction so it it makes me think about what is actually required for effective negotiation that's what ai systems do is they make you ask yourself what is it that makes humans special any discipline what is it that makes humans special at chess and go games which ai systems are able to beat humans at now what is it that makes them effective at negotiation what does it make them effective at something that's extremely difficult which is navigating physical spaces so doing things that we take for granted like making yourself a cup of coffee is exceptionally difficult problem for robots yeah because of all the complexities involved in navigating physical reality we we have so much common sense reasoning built in just about how gravity works about how objects move the what kind of objects there are in the world it's like it's it's really difficult to describe because it all seems so damn trivial but it's not trivial right because a lot of that we just learn as babies we keep running into things and we learn right about that and so ai systems help us understand what is it that makes humans really what is the wisdom we have in our heads and negotiation to me is super interesting because negotiation is not it's about business it's about geopolitics it's about running government it's basically negotiating how do we the different policies different bills and programs and so on how do we allocate money how do we reallocate resources all that kind of stuff that seems like ai in the future could be better at that but maybe not maybe you have to be a messy weird insecure uncertain human and debate each other and yell at each other on twitter maybe you have to have the red and the blue teams that yell at each other in in the process of figuring out what is true maybe ai systems will not be able to do that and figure out the full mess of human of human civilization yeah interesting well i mean the the two thoughts that i had along the way was i mean is anytime you're talking about systems or scaling you know yeah you're talking my belief is chatbot systems things that don't require decision making just following the instructions at least eighty percent of what's going on now the remaining percentage whatever it is does it does it require the human interaction and what's required like i'm not i'm not i'm not like i am not pro conflict and i also know that there's a case to be made in the creative world that some of the best thinking came out of conflict reading interviews with bon o you too you know their their admiration for some of the beatles' best music came when they were fighting with each other and the song one octune which is i believe from the album octune baby those guys were fighting i mean they were on a verge of breaking up and their appreciation that conflict could create something beautiful and then when i was in a crisis negotiation unit you know my last seven years in the fbi there was a guy that named vince brilliant dude brilliant brilliant negotiator and he and i used to argue all the time and then when we had a change in the guy who was in charge the guy who was in charge took me off to the side he's like you know i can't take you and vince fighting all the time and i said well i got news for you i think we come up with much better stuff as a result of our battles and he said you know vince said the same thing to me yeah and i'm like so if we don't have a problem fighting why why do you have a problem with it but you know some there is there is something there that sometimes the most difficult insights you rack your brains as to why someone is so dug in on something that so you think is so wrong yeah maybe there's something to it i think there's something to it there's something about conflict even drama that might be a feature not a bug of our society interesting do you think there will always be war in the world yeah so there will always be a need for negotiators and negotiating well as it turns out why do you why do you think there will always be war is it what's your intuition about human nature there yeah just because we're basically seventy five percent negative and then for lack of a better term i call it two lines of code like somewhere when you everybody when we were little somebody planted in two lines into our head we don't know when it got in there but somebody said something to us that stuck and there are a lot of people that had some really negative garbage dumped in their brain when they were little and just based on the numbers yeah what kind of opportunity they were given afterwards did they ever have an epiphany moment when they genuinely believe they can get get themselves out of it like what is it one of joe dispenza's book is breaking the habit of being yourself yeah you know like how do you get at that two lines of code that that that either mean or well intentioned but stupidly speaking adults said to you at the wrong moment and planted in your brain like how the chances of everybody on earth getting out of getting that out of even the majority of people on earth getting that out of their heads is is really small what advice would you give to a young person today about how to have a career they could be proud of or a a life maybe somebody in high school college trying to figure out their way in this world it's probably a take on a cliche of do what you love but if you if you figure out your ideals and pursue your ideals and stick to them when it costs you like a a guy i admire very much michael mogile runs this operation crisp video at atlanta in one of his talks he would say core values are what you stick to that cost you money mhmm it's not a value that really matters to you unless it it's costing you and stick to your values now when i was in the fbi i worked really hard at you know the number one core mission of the fbi is protect and defend the american people so i could pursue that value at all times which i did or i could follow the rules you don't have time to do both when did you know you you found what you love when did you fall in love with whatever this process is that is negotiating i think it was in in a conversation on the suicide hotline that i was telling you about earlier with the guy who was paranoid mhmm when i thought i can have that significant of an impact on another human being in this short of a period of time that's really cool how hard is it to talk somebody off the ledge so this question is a big question why why the hell live at all how do you have that kind of deeply philosophical deeply psychological and also practical conversation with somebody and convince them they they should stick around well it it's more clear and clear the clutter in their head and and let them make up their own mind that that was what volunteering on suicide island was really about just let me help let me let me see how quickly i can clear out the clutter in your head if you're willing to have it cleared out like did did you call here because you're actually looking for help or did you call here to fulfill some other agenda so are you you know are you are you willing to have are you willing to clear the clutter in your head not everybody is so once you clear the clutter is it is at least somewhat hopeful chance that you'll you'll continue for another day yeah and and like if you step back like very few people that commit suicide physically are up against it that hard mhmm like most of them by and large are pretty intact physically human beings they're struggling with emotional stuff but the it's it's an it's an emotional issue it's not a physical issue so if you would be a complete mercenary like a a guy i'm a very big fan of a guy named mark pollock born great athlete lost his eyesight and then became paralyzed like he's an emotional leader he's about helping people thrive and live great lives like marx was born he was a spectacular athlete and first he lost his sight in one eye then he lost his sight in the other eye and then he fell out a window in a in a tragic experience like if there was ever a dude that was saying like living sucks you know and if there's any doubt in my mind something worse happens to me every few years but mark's about being alive and inspiring other people so the hard part with navigate was somebody who's tossing it in because they there there's a chemical imbalance or or they're it's the way they're interpreting the world yeah there's clutter in their head like how can you how can you help clear that clutter in their head and help them by themselves inspire them to reinterpret that world yeah as one worth living in yeah what do you think is the meaning of life boss why why live what's what's why what's what's a good reason well i have i have i have very strong religious beliefs spiritual you know i i don't a thousand percent if you were to try to confine me in a box i'd be a christian i have tremendous respect for the jewish i don't think any religions got it nailed exactly again you know i keep mentioning him i'm kind of a bono christian i think bono's he's like what and i'm gonna butcher it but you know my belief in jesus is what i've got after christianity leaves a room you know the dogma of man's application of spiritual beliefs so but that being said i i i truly believe that my life was a gift and there's there's a purpose here and you know for my creator decided that i woke up in the morning because he still had some cool interesting things for me to do and you have gratitude for having the opportunity to live that day yeah well you do one heck of a good job at living those days i really appreciate your work i appreciate the person you are thank you for just everything you've done today for just being empathic
