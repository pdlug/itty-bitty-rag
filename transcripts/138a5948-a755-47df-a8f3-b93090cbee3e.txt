the following is a conversation with ivanka trump businesswoman real estate developer and former senior adviser to the president of the united states i've gotten to know ivanka well over the past two years we've become good friends hitting it off right away over our mutual love of reading especially philosophical writings from marcus aurelius joseph campbell ellen watts victor franklin and so on she is a truly kind compassionate and thoughtful human being in the past people have attacked her in my view to get indirectly at her dad donald trump as part of a dirty game of politics and clickbait journalism these attacks obscured many projects and efforts often bipartisan that she helped get done and they obscured the truth of who she is as a human being through all that she never returned the attacks with anything but kindness and always walked through the fire of it all with grace for this and much more she is an inspiration and i'm honored to be able to call her a friend oh and for those living in the united states happy upcoming fourth of july it's both an anniversary of this country's declaration of independence and an anniversary of my immigrating here to the us i am forever

sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's ivanka trump you said that ever since you were young you wanted to be a builder that you loved the idea of designing beautiful city skylines especially in new york city i love the new york city skyline so describe the origins of that love of building you know i think there's both an incredible confidence and a total insecurity that comes with youth so i remember at fifteen i would look out over the city skyline for my bedroom window in new york and imagine where i could contribute and and add value in a way that you know i look back on and and completely laugh at you know how confident i was but i've i've known since some of my earliest memories it's something i've wanted to do and i think i fundamentally i love art i love expressions of of beauty in so many different forms with architecture there's the tangible and i think that marriage of function and something that exists beyond yourself is very compelling i also grew up in a family where my mother was in the real estate business working alongside my father my father was in the business and i saw the joy that it brought to them so i think i had these natural positive associations they used to send me as a little girl renderings of projects they were about to embark on with notes asking if i would hurry up and finish school so i could come join them so i had these positive associations but i came from something within myself i think that as i got older and as i got involved in real estate i realized that it was so multidisciplinary you have of course the design but you also have engineering the brass tacks of construction there's time management there's project planning just the duration of time to complete one of these iconic structures it's enormous you can contribute a decade of your life to one project so while you have to think big picture it means you really have to care deeply about the details because you you live with them so it it allowed me to flex a lot of areas of interest i love that confidence of youth it's it's funny because we're all so insecure right in the most basic interactions but yet our ambitions are so unbridled in a way that kind of like makes you blush as an adult and i think it's fun it's fun to like tap into that energy yeah where everything is possible i think yeah some of the the greatest builders i've ever met kind of always have that little flame of everything is possible still burning that is a silly notion from youth but it's not so silly yeah you know everybody tells you something is impossible but if you continue believing that it's possible and have that sort of naive notion that you could do it even if it's exceptionally difficult that naive notion turns into some of the greatest projects ever done a hundred percent you know going out to space or building a new company where like everybody said it's impossible to take on the gigantic company and disrupting them and revolutionizing how stuff is done or doing huge building projects or like you said so many people are involved in making that happen we get conditioned out of that feeling yeah we start to become insecure and it's we start to rely on the input or validation of others and it takes us away from that sort of core drive and and ambition so it's fun to to reflect on that and also to smile right because whether you can execute or not time will tell but but yeah no that was that was very much my childhood yeah of course it's important to also have the humility once you get humbled and realize that it's actually a lot of work to build i still am amazed just looking at big buildings big bridges that human beings are able to get together and build those things that's one of my favorite things about architecture it's just like wow it's it's a a manifestation of the fact that humans can collaborate and do something like epic much bigger than themselves and it's like a statue that represents that and it can be there for a long time i think in in some ways you look out at at different city skylines and it's it's almost like a visual depiction of ambition realized right like it's a testament to somebody's dream not somebody whole ensemble of people's dreams and visions and triumphs and in some cases failures if the projects weren't properly executed so you look at these skylines and it's a testament to that i actually heard once architecture described as frozen music that really resonated with me i love to think about a city skyline as an ensemble of dreams realized yeah i remember the first time i i went to dubai and i was watching them dredging out and creating these manmade islands and i remember somebody once saying to me they're an architect an architect actually who collaborated with us on our tower in chicago he said that the only thing that limited what so so it's it's you know yeah but gravity is a tricky one to work against and that's where civil engineer is one of my favorite things they used to build bridges in high school for physics classes you have to build bridges and you compete on how much weight they can carry relative to their own weight yeah you study how good it is by finding its breaking point and that was a deep appreciation for me on a miniature scale of on a large scale what people are able to do with civil engineering yes because gravity is a tricky one to fight against it definitely is and bridges i mean some of the iconic designs in in our country are incredible bridges so if we think of skylines as ensembles of dreams realized you spent quite a bit of time in new york what what do you love about and what do you think about the new york city skyline what's a good picture we're looking here at a few i mean looking over the water well i think the water is an unbelievable feature of the new york skyline as you see the island on approach and oftentimes you'll see like in these images you'll see these towers reflecting off of the water surface so i think there's something very beautiful and unique about that when i look at new york i see this unbelievable sort of tapestry of different types of architecture so you have the gothic form as represented by buildings like the woolworth building or you'll have art deco as represented by buildings like forty wall street or the chrysler building or rockefeller center and and then you'll have these unbelievable super modern examples or modernist examples like lever house and seagram's house so you have all of these different styles and i think to build in new york you're really building the best of the best so nobody's giving new york their sort of second rate work and especially when a lot of those buildings were built there was this incredible competition happening between new york and chicago for kind of dominance of the sky and for who could create the greatest skyline that sort of race to the sky when skyscrapers were first being built starting in chicago and then new york surpassing that in terms of height at least with the empire state building so i love sort of contextualizing the skylines as well and thinking back to when different components that are so iconic were were added and and the context in which they came into being i gotta ask you about this there's a pretty cool page that i've been following on x architecture and tradition and they celebrate sort of traditional schools of architecture and you mentioned gothic the tapestry this is in chicago the tribune tower in chicago so what do you think about that sort of the the old and the new mixed together do you like gothic i think it's hard to look at something like the tribune tower and not be completely in awe like this is an unbelievable building look at those buttresses and you've got gargoyles hanging off of it yeah and you know this style was reminiscent of the cathedrals of europe which was very kind of in vogue in the nineteen twenties here in america actually i mentioned the woolworth tower before the woolworth tower was actually referred to as the cathedral of commerce and because it also was in that gothic style amazing so this was built maybe a decade before the tribune building but the tribune building to me is is it's almost not replicable it personally really resonates with me because one of the first projects i ever worked on was building trump chicago which was this beautiful elegant super modern all glass skyscraper right across the way so it was right across the river so i would look out the windows as it was under construction or be standing quite literally on rebar of the building looking out at the tribune and incredibly inspired and now the reflective glass of the building reflects back not only the river but but also the tribune building and other buildings on michigan avenue do you like it when the glass the reflective properties of the of the glass as part of the architecture i think it depends like they have super reflective glass that sometimes doesn't work it's distracting and i i think it it's it's one component of sort of a composition that comes together i think in this case the glass on trump's chicago is very beautiful it was designed by adrian smith of skidmore owings and merrill a major architecture firm who actually did the burj khalifa in dubai which is i think like an awe inspiring example of of modern architecture but glass is tricky it's you have to get the shade right you know some glass has a lot of iron in it and gets super green and that's a choice and sometimes you have more blue properties blue silver like you see here but it's it's it's part of the character how do you know what what it's actually going to look like when it's done like is it possible to imagine that because it feels like there's so many variables i think so i think if you have a vivid imagination if you sit with it and then if you also go beyond the rendering right you have to you have to live with the materials so you don't build a ninety two story building glass curtain wall and not deeply examine the actual curtain wall before purchasing it so you have to spend a lot of time with the actual materials not just the beautiful artistic renderings which can be incredibly misleading the goal is that the end result is much much more compelling than what the architect or artist rendered but oftentimes that's very much not the case you mentioned context sometimes i'll see renderings of buildings i'm like wait what about the building right to the left of it that's blocking eighty percent of its views of the you know they'll the you know architects they'll remove things that are inconvenient they'll so so you have to you have to be rooted in in reality in reality exactly and i love the notion of living with the with the materials in contrast to living in the imagined world of the drawings yeah so the the both both are probably important because you have to dream the thing into existence but you also have to be rooted in like what the thing is actually going to look like in the context of everything else hundred percent one of the underlying principles of the page you just mentioned and i hear folks mention this a lot is that modern architecture is kinda boring that it lacks soul and beauty and you just spoke with admiration for both modern and for gothic for older architectures so do you think there's truth that modern architecture is boring i'm living in miami currently so i see a lot of super uninspired glass boxes on on the waterfront but but i think exceptional things shouldn't be the norm you know they're typically rare so and i think in modern architecture you find an abundance of amazing examples of of super compelling and and innovative building designs i mean i mentioned the burj khalifa it is awe inspiring this is an unbelievably striking example of modern architecture you look at some older examples the sydney opera house so i think there's unbelievable there you go i mean it's like a needle in the sky yeah reaching out to the stars it's it's huge and in the context of a city where there's a lot of height yeah so it's it's unbelievable but i i think one of the things that's probably exciting me the most about architecture right now is the innovation that's happening within it you know there's example of robotic fabrication there's three d printing your friend and and who you introduced me to not too long ago neri oxman what she's doing at the intersection and thinking about how to create more sustainable development practices quite literally trying to create materials that will biodegrade back into the earth i think there's something really cool happening now with the red romans an art and a practice of using volcanic ash and lime that's now being rediscovered and is more critical than ever as we think about how much of our infrastructure relies on concrete and how much of that is failing on the most basic level so i think actually it's a really really exciting time for innovation in architecture and i think there are some incredible examples of of of modern design that are really exciting but generally i think roosevelt said that comparison is the thief of joy so it's hard you know you look at the tribune building you look at some of these iconic structures one of the buildings i'm most proud to have worked on was the historical post office building in washington dc you look at a building like that and it feels like it has no equal also there's a psychological element where people tend to wanna complain about the new and celebrate the old oh it's like the history of time so there's just people are always concerned skeptical and concerned about change yeah and it's true that there's a lot of stuff that's new that's not good it's not gonna last it's not gonna stand the test of time but some things will and there's just like in modern art there's in modern music there's going to be artists that stand the test of time and we'll later look back and celebrate them those are the good times yeah when you just step back what do you love about architecture is it the beauty is it the function i'm most emotionally drawn obviously to the beauty but i think as somebody who's built things i really believe that the form has to follow the function like there's nothing uglier than a space that is ill conceived otherwise it's decoration and i think that after sort of that initial reaction to seeing something that's aesthetically really pleasing to me when i when i look at a when i look at a building or or a project i love sort of thinking about how it's being used so having been able to build so many things and in my career and and worked on so many incredible projects i mean it's really really rewarding after the fact to have somebody come up to you and and tell you that they got engaged in the lobby of your building or they got married in the ballroom and and share with you some of those experiences so so to me that's equally as beautiful the the use cases for for these unbelievable projects but but i think i think it's all of it i i love i love that you've got the construction and you've got the design and you've got then the interior design and you've got the financing elements the marketing elements and it's all wrapped up in in this one effort so so to me it's exciting to sort of flex in all those different ways yeah like you said it's dreams realized hard work realized i mean probably on the bridge side is why i love the function in terms of function being primary you just think of like the millions oh my gosh look at that bridges go go down you had look at that yeah this is devil's bridge in germany yeah i wanna say it's like the most practical design but look how beautiful that is yeah so this is probably well we don't know we need to interview some people whether the function holds up but in terms of beauty and then like like what we're talking about using the water for the reflection and the shape that creates i mean there's an elegance to the shape of a of a bridge see it's interesting that they call it devil's bridge because to me this is very ethereal you know i think about the ring the circle yeah life there's nothing about this that makes me feel maybe they're just being ironic in the names once that function's really flawed yeah exactly maybe nobody's ever successfully crossed crossed the bridge yeah but i mean to to me there's just iconic i love looking at bridges because because of the function it's the brooklyn bridge or the golden gate bridge i mean those are probably my favorites in the united states just in a city to be able to look out and see the skyline combined with the suspension bridge and thinking of all the millions of cars that pass like the busyness like us humans get getting together and going to work building cool stuff and just the bridge kind of represents the turmoil and the busyness of a city as it creates it's cool and the connectivity as well yeah the network of roads all come together so the there the bridge is the ultimate combination of function and and beauty yeah i remember when i was first learning about bridges studying the cable stay versus the suspension bridge and i mean you actually built many replicas so i'm sure you'll have a point of view on this but they're they really are so beautiful and you you mentioned the brooklyn bridge but growing up in new york that was as much a part of the architectural story and tapestry of that skyline as any building that's that's seen in it so what in general is your philosophy philosophy of design and building in architecture well some of the most recent projects i i worked on prior to government service were the old post office building and almost simultaneously trump doral in miami so these were both two just massive undertakings both redevelopments which in a lot of cases having worked on ground up construction redevelopment projects are in a lot of ways much more complicated because you have existing attributes but also a lot of limitations you have to work within especially when you're repurposing a use so so this the old post office building on pennsylvania avenue it's so beautiful it's unbelievable so this was a romanesque revival building built in the eighteen nineties on america's main street to symbolize american grandeur and at the time there were post office being built in the style across the country but this being really the defining one still to this day the tallest habitable structure in washington the tallest structure being the monument the nation's only vertical park which is that clock tower but you've got these thick granite walls those carved granite turrets just an unbelievable building you've got this massive atrium that runs through the whole center of it that is topped with glass so having the opportunity to spearhead a project like that was so exciting and actually it was my first renovation project so i i came to it with a tremendous amount of energy vigor and and humility about how to do it properly ensuring i had all the right people we had countless federal and local government agencies that would oversee every single decision we made but in advance of even having the opportunity to do it there was a close to two year request for proposal like a process that was put out by the general services administration so it was this really arduous government procurement process that we were competing against so many different people for the opportunity which a lot of people said it was a gigantic waste of time but i looked at that and i think so did a lot of the other bidders and say it's worth trying to put the best vision forward so you fell in love with this project like this in love yeah so what would is there some interesting details about what it takes to do renovation is there about some some of the challenges or opportunities because you you wanna maintain the beauty of the old yeah and now like upgrade the functionality i guess and maybe modernize some aspects of it without destroying what made the the building magical in the first place so i think the greatest asset was already there mhmm the exterior of the building which we meticulously restored and any addition to it had to be done sort of very gently in terms of any signage additions and the interior spaces were completely dilapidated it had been in a post office then we was used for a really rundown food court and government office spaces it was actually losing six million dollars a year when we got the concession to build it and when we won and became one of i think a great example of public private partnerships working together but the i think the biggest challenge in having such a radical use conversion is just how you lay it out so the amount of time i would get on that acela twice a week three times a week to spend eight trips down in washington and we would walk every single inch of the building laying out the floor plans debating over the configuration of a room there were almost three hundred rooms and there were almost three hundred layouts so nothing could be repeated whereas when you have when you're building from scratch you tend you know you have a box and you decide where you wanna add potential elements and you can stack the floor plan all the way up but when you're working within a building like this every single room was different you see the setbacks so the setback then required you to move the plumbing so there was no it was really a labor of love and to do something like this and that's why i think renovation we had it with doral as well it was seven hundred rooms over over six hundred and fifty acres of of property and so every single unit was very different and complicated not as complicated in some ways the scale of it was so massive but not as complicated as the old post office but it required a level of precision and i think in real estate you have a lot of people who design on plan and a lot of people who are in the business of sort of acquiring and flipping so it's more financial engineering than it is building and they don't spend the time sort of sweating these details that make something great and make something functional and you feel it in the end result but i i mean blood sweat tears years of my life for for those projects and and it was worth it i i enjoyed almost i enjoyed almost every minute of it so to you it's not about the flipping to you it's about the art of the and the function of the thing that you're creating a hundred percent what's design on plan i'm learning new things today when when proposals are put forth by an architect and and really just the plan is accepted without and in the case of a renovation if you're not walking those rooms the number of times a beautifully laid out room was on a blueprint and then i'd go to washington and i'd walk that floor and i'd realize that there was a column that ran right up through the middle of the space where you know the bed was supposed to be or the toilet was supposed to be or or the shower so there's a lot of things that are missed when you do something conceptually without sort of rooting it in in the actual structure and that's why i think even you know with ground up construction as well people who aren't constantly on their job sites constantly walking the projects there's just a lot that's there's a lot that's missed i mean there's a wisdom to the the idea that we talked about before live with the materials and walking the construction site walking the rooms i mean that's what you hear from people like steve jobs like elon yeah that's why you live in the factory floor that's why you constantly obsess about the details the actual not of the the plans but the physical reality of the product i mean the the insanity of steve jobs and johnny and i working together on like making it perfect making the iphone the early designs prototypes making that perfect like what it actually feels like in the hand you have to be there like as close to the metal as possible to truly understand and you have to love it in order to do that right it it shouldn't be about the how much it's going to sell for yeah all that kind of stuff you have to love the art because for the most part he can probably get ninety maybe ninety five percent of the end result unless something has terribly gone awry by by not caring with that level of almost like maniacal precision but you'll notice that ten percent for the rest of your life you know so i think i think that extra effort that that passion i think that's what separates good from great if we go back to that young ivanka the the confidence of youth and if we could talk about your mom she had a big influence on you you told me she was an adventurer yeah olympic skier and a businesswoman what what did you learn about life from your mother so much she passed away two years ago now and she was a remarkable remarkable woman she was a trailblazer in so many different ways as an athlete and growing up in communist czech slovakia as a fashion mogul as a real estate executive and and builder just this all around trail blazing businesswoman i also learned from her you know aside from from that element how to really enjoy life you know i look back and some of my happiest memories of her are in the ocean you know just lying on her back looking up at the sun and just so so in the moment or dancing she loved to dance so she she really taught me a lot about living life to its fullest and and she had so much courage so much conviction so much energy and a complete comfort with who she was what do you think about that i mean olympic athlete the trade off between like ambition and just wanting to do big things and pursuing that and giving your all to that and being able to relax and just throw your arms back and enjoy the moment every moment of life but like that trade off yeah what what do you think about that trade off i think because she was this unbelievable formidable athlete and because of the discipline she had as a child i think it made her value those moments more as an adult i think she was a great balance of the two that we all hope to find and she was able to find both incredibly serious and formidable i remember as a little girl i used to literally traipse behind her at the plaza hotel which she oversaw and actually kind of was her old post office it was this unbelievable historic hotel in new york city and i'd follow her around at construction meetings and on job sites and there she is dancing see that's funny that that's the picture you pull up i'm sorry the two of you just look great in that picture that's great she had such a a joy to her and she was so unabashed in her perspective and her opinions i mean you know she made my father look reserved so whatever she was feeling what she was just very expressive and and a lot of fun to be around so she as you mentioned grew up during the the prague spring in nineteen sixty eight and that had a big impact on human history i mean my my family came from the soviet union and then you know the twentieth century the story of the twentieth century is a lot of eastern europe the soviet union tried the ideas of of communism and it turned out that a lot of those ideas resulted into a lot of suffering so why do you think the communist ideology failed i think fundamentally as people we desire freedom we want agency you know and and my mom was like a lot of other people who grew up in in similar situations where she didn't like to talk about it that often mhmm so one of my real regrets is that i didn't push her harder you know so but i think back to the conversations we did have and i try to imagine what it's like she was at charles university in prague which was really like a focal point of of the reforms that were ushered in during the prague spring and the liberalization agenda that was happening the dance halls were opening the student activists and she was attending university there right at that same time so the contrast to this feeling of freedom and progress and liberalization in the spring and then it's so quickly being crushed in the fall of that same year when the warsaw pact countries and the soviet union rolled in to put down and ultimately roll back all those reforms so for her to have lived through that she didn't come to north america until she was twenty three or twenty four so that was her life as as as a young girl she was on the junior national ski team for czechoslovakia my grandfather used to train her they used to put the skis on her back and walk up the mountain in czechoslovakia because there were no there were no ski lifts she actually made me do that when i was a child just to to let me know what her experience had been if i complained that it was cold out she's like well you didn't have to walk up the mountain you'd be you'd be plenty warm if you had carried the skis up on your back up the last run i feel like they made people tougher back then like my my grandma you mentioned it's funny they they go through some of the darkest things that a human being can go through and they don't talk about it and they have a general positive outlook on life like that's deeply rooted in the knowledge of what life could be yeah like how bad it could get my grandma survived holodomor in ukraine which is was a mass starvation brought on by the the collectivist policies of the stalin regime and then she survived the nazi occupation of ukraine never talked about it probably went through extremely dark extremely difficult times and then just always had a positive outlook on life and also made me do very difficult physical activity like as you can imagine just to to humble you like kids these days are soft kind of energy which i'm deeply deeply grateful for on on all fronts including just having hardship and including just physical hardship flung at me yeah i think that's really important you wonder how much of of who they were was a reaction to their experience would she have naturally had that forward looking grateful optimistic orientation or was it a reaction to to our childhood i think about that you know i look at this picture of my mom and she was unabashedly herself you know she loved flamboyance and glamour and in some ways i think it probably was a direct reaction to this very austere controlled childhood you know this was one expression of it i think her you know how she dressed and how she presented i think her entrepreneurial spirit and love of capitalism and all things american was was another manifestation of it and one that i grew up with i remember the story she used to tell me about when she was fourteen and she was going to neighboring countries and you know as an athlete you were given additional freedoms that that you wouldn't otherwise be afforded in in in these societies under under communist rule so she was able to travel where most of her friends never would be able to leave czechoslovakia and she would come back from all of these trips and the first place where she'd do ski races in austria and elsewhere and the first thing she had to do was check-in at the local police and she'd sit down and she had enough wisdom at fourteen to know that she couldn't appear to be lying by not being impressed by what she saw and the fact that you could get an orange in the winter but she couldn't be too excited by it that she'd become a flight risk so give enough details oh boy that you're believable but not so many that you're not trusted and imagine that as a fourteen year old you know that experience and and having to navigate the world that way and she told me that eventually all those local police officers they came to love her because one of the things she do is smuggle that stuff back from these countries and give it to them to give their wives perfume and stockings and so so she figured out the system pretty quickly but but it's it's a very different experience from what i was navigating and the pressures and challenges me as a fourteen year old was was dealing with so so i have so much respect and and admiration for her yeah hardship clarifies what's important in life you and i have talked about man's search for meaning that book having kind of an ultimate hardship clarifies that finding joy in life is not about the environment it's about your outlook on that environment and there's beauty to be found in any situation yeah and also in that particular situation the when everything is taken from you the thing you start to think about is the people you love so in the case of man's search for meaning viktor frankl thinking about his his wife and how much he loves her and that love was the flame the the the the warmth that kept him excited the fun thing to think about when everything else is gone so we sometimes forget that with the busyness of life and get all this fun stuff we're talking about like building and being a creative force in the world at the end of the day what matters is just like the other humans in your life the people you love hundred percent it's the simple stuff you know viktor frankl is somebody i mean his that book and just his philosophy in general is so inspiring to me but i think so many people they say they want happiness but they want conditional happiness when this and this thing happens or under these circumstances then i'll be happy and i think what he showed is that we can sort of cultivate these virtues within ourselves regardless of the situation we find ourselves in and in some ways i think the meaning of life is the search for meaning in life it's the relationships we have and we form it's the experience we have it's how we deal with the suffering that life inevitably presents to us and and viktor frankl does an amazing job highlighting that under the most horrific circumstances and i think it's it's just super inspiring to me he also shows that you can get so much from just like small joys like getting a little more soup today than you did yesterday i mean it's like it's the little stuff if you allow yourself to love the little stuff of life it's all around you it's all there so you don't need to like have these ambitious goals and the comparison being a thief of joy that kind of stuff just like it's all around us the ability to eat like when i when i was in the jungle and i got severely dehydrated because there's no water you run out of water real quick and i mean the joy felt when i got to drink like i didn't care about anything else speaking of things that matter in life i i was i was starting to fantasize about water and it that was bringing me joy you can tap into this feeling at any time exactly i was just tapping in just to stay positive your bathroom turn on the sink and watch the water all for sure for sure i mean people really i it's good to have stuff taken away for time that's why struggle is good to make you appreciate to have a deep gratitude for when you have it and water and food is a big one but water is the biggest one i i wouldn't recommend it necessarily to get severely dehydrated to appreciate water but maybe every time you take a sip of water you could have that kind of gratitude there's a a prayer in judaism you're supposed to say every morning which is basically thanking god for your body working it's it's something you know so basic but it's when it doesn't that we're grateful so just reminding ourselves every day the basic things of a functional body of our health of access to water which so many millions of people around the world do not have reliably is very clarifying and super important yeah health is a gift water is a gift yeah is there a memory with your mom that had a defining effect on your life i have these vignettes in my mind you know seeing her in action in different capacities a lot of times in the context of things that i would later go on to do myself so you know i would go every day almost every day after school and i'd go to the plaza hotel and i'd follow her around as she'd walk the hallways and just observe her and she was so impossibly glamorous she was doing everything in four and a half inch heels with this bouffant and so it was almost like an it's almost like an inaccessible visual but i think for me when i saw her experience the most joy tended to be by the sea almost always not not a pool and i think i get this from her i pools they're fine i love the ocean i i love salt water i love the way it makes me feel and and i think i got that from her so we would we would just swim together all all the time and and you know it's it's a lot of what i love about miami actually being being so close to the ocean i find it to be super cathartic but a lot of my memories of my mom seeing her really like just in her bliss is is floating around in in in a body of salt water is there also some aspect to her being an example of somebody that could be sort of beautiful and feminine but at the same time powerful a successful businesswoman that show that it's possible to do that yeah i think she really was a trailblazer it's not uncommon in in real estate for there to be multiple generations of of people and so on on job sites i it was not unusual for me to run into somebody whose grandfather had worked with my grandfather in brooklyn or queens or whose father had worked with my mother and they'd always tell me these stories about her rolling in and they'd hear the heels first and and a lot of times the story would be like oh gosh like you know really it's two days after christmas like we thought we'd get a reprieve but she was she was very exacting you know so i have this visual in my mind of her you know walking on rebar you know on the balls of her feet in these four inch heels nice i'm assuming she actually carried flats with her yeah but but i don't know that's not the visual i have but she was i loved the fact that she so embodied femininity and and glamour and and was so comfortable being tough and ambitious and determined and and this unbelievable businesswoman businesses that i've been in there really aren't women outside of sales and of marketing you don't see as many women in the development space in the construction space even in the architecture and and design space maybe outside of interior design so and she was you know decades ahead of me so it was i love hearing these stories i love i love hearing somebody who's my peer tell me about their grandfather and their father and their experience with with one of my parents it's it's amazing and she did it all in four inch heels and she did it she used to say there's nothing that i can't do better in heels that's a good one that would be her that would be her exact thing and when i complain about wearing something you know it was like the early nineties everything was also like uncomfortable these fabrics and materials and and i was i would like go back and forth between being super girly and a total tomboy but but she'd you know dress me up in in these things and i'd be complaining about it and she'd say ivanka paying for beauty which i happen to totally disagree with yeah because i think there's nothing worse than being uncomfortable so i haven't accepted or internalized all of this this wisdom so to speak but but it was just funny you know she had she had a very specific point of view mhmm this and full of good lines pain for beauty that's me it's it's funny because i mean just even in fashion if something's uncomfortable to me there's nothing that looks worse than when you see somebody like tottering around and like their heels hurt them so they're kind of walking oddly and you know it doesn't they're not embodying their confidence in that regard so i'm like kinda the opposite i start with well i wanna be comfortable and that helps me be confident and and in command a foundation for fashion for you is comfort and on top of that you build things that are used like doughty you know there's that level of comfort but functional comfort but i think you have to for me i wanna feel confident mhmm and you don't feel confident when you're like pulling at a garment or you know hobbling on heels that don't fit you properly and she was never doing those things either so i don't know how she was wearing stuff like that that's like a forty pound veda dress and i know this because i have it yeah and i wore it recently and i mean i gotta work out walking to the elevator yeah like this is a heavy dress and you know it was worth it it was great yeah she's making it look easy though but she she makes it look very very easy so do you miss her i'm so much it's unbelievable how dislocating the loss of a of a parent is and her mother lives with me still my grandmother who helped raise us so that's very special and i can ask her some of the questions that i would've sorry i wanted to ask my own mom but it's hard it was beautiful to see how i've gotten a chance to spend time with your family to see so many generations together at the table and there's so much history there no she's ninety seven and until she was around ninety four she lived completely on her own no help no anything no support and and now she requires really sort of twenty four hour care and i i feel super grateful that i'm able to give her that because that's what she did for me it's amazing for me to have my children be able to grow up and and know her stories know her recipes check dumplings and and goulash and quetzalice and all the other things she used to make me in my childhood but she was a major force in my life my grandmother you know my mom was working so you know my grandmother was the person who was always home every day when i came back from school and i remember i used to shower and it would almost be like comical i i feel like in my memory and there is no washing machine i've seen on the planet that can actually do this but in my memory i'd go to shower you know and i'd drop something on the bed and i'd come back into the room after my shower and it was like folded pressed it was all my grandmother's kitchen she's like running after me taking care of me and so it's nice to be able to do that for her yeah i got from her reading my grandmother she would she devoured books like devoured books she loved the more sensational ones so like some of these like romance novels i would pick them up the covers but she could tell you she could look at like any royal lineage across europe and tell you all the mistresses yes all the drama all the drama she loved it but her face was always buried in a book you know my grandfather dedo he was the athlete he was he swam professionally for or you know on the national team for czechoslovakia and he helped train my mom as i was saying before in skiing so he was a great athlete and she was at home and she would read and cook and and so that's that's something i i remember a lot from my childhood and she would always say like i got i got reading from her i mean speaking of drama i had my english teacher in high school recommended a book for me by d h lawrence it's supposed to be a classic she's like this is a classic you should read it's called lady shadow haze lover and so i've read a lot of classics but that one is straight up like a romance novel about a wife who likes just cheating with a gardener and i remember reading this like what like in retrospect i understand why it's a classic because it was so scandalous to talk about sex in a book a hundred years ago whatever in retrospect do you know why she recommended it to you i have no i think maybe she's sending a signal hey you need to get out more or something i don't know maybe maybe she was seeking to inspire you less yeah exactly anyway i i mean i love that kind of stuff too but i love i love all the classics and they get they get there's a lot of drama human nature drama is part of it so what about your dad growing up what did you learn about life from your father i think my father's sense of humor is sometimes underappreciated so he had an amazing and has an amazing sense of humor he loved music i i think my my mom loved music as well but you know my father always used to say that in another life he would have been a broadway musical producer which is hilarious to think about but he loves he loves music i that that is funny to think about right he does now he djs at mar a lago so people get a sense of you know he loves andrew lloyd webber and all of it pavarotti elton john i mean these were the same songs on repeat my whole childhood so i know the playlist probably sinatra and all that love sinatra love elvis you know a lot of a lot of the greats so i i think i got a little bit of my love for music from from him but my mom shared that as well i think one of the things you know in in in looking back that i think i inherited from my father as well is this sort of interest or understanding of the importance of asking questions and specifically questions of the right people and i saw this a lot on on job sites so i remember with the old post office building there was this massive glass topped atrium so heating and cooling the structure was like a herculean lift we had the mechanical engineers provide their thoughts on how we could do it efficiently and and so that the temperature never varied and it was enormously expensive as an as an undertaking and i remember one of his first times on on the site because you know he had really empowered me with this project and he trusted me to to execute and to also rope him in when i needed it but one of the first time he visits we're walking the hallway and we're talking about how expensive this cooling system would be and heating system would be and he starts stopping and he's asking duct workers as as we walk what they think of the system that the mechanical engineer has designed first few fine you know not great answers the third guy goes sir if you want me to be honest with you it's obscenely overdesigned in the circumstance of a one thousand year storm you will have the exact pem perfect temperature if there's a massive blizzard or if it's unbearably hot but ninety nine point nine percent of the time you'll never need it and so i think it's just an enormous waste of money and so we kept asking that guy questions and so i learned a lot and that's just one example of countless and so i learned a lot and that's just one example of countless that one really takes out of my head because i'm like oh my gosh we're redesigning the whole system you know we were actively under construction but i would see him do that on a lot of different issues he would ask people on the work level what their thoughts were ideas concepts designs and there was almost like a socratic sort of first principles type of way he he questioned people trying to get down to sort of trying to reduce complex things to something really fundamental and and and simple so i i try to do that myself to the to the best i can and and i think it's something i very much learned from him yeah i've seen great engineers great leaders do just that you see you wanna do that a lot which is basically ask questions to push simplification yeah can we do this simpler and like why the basic question is like why are we doing it this way can this be done simpler yeah and not taking as an answer that this is how we've always done it sort of not not allowing yourself like it doesn't matter that's how we always done it what is the right way to do it and what is and usually the simpler it is the more correct the way yeah has to do with costs has to do with simplicity of of production manufacture but usually simple is best and it's oftentimes not the architecture the engineers it's you know in elon's case probably the line worker who sees things more clearly so i think making sure it's not just that you're asking good questions you're asking the right people those same good questions that's why like a lot of the elon companies are really flat in terms of organizational design where the the any anybody on the factory floor can talk directly to you on there's no there's not there's not this managerial class this hierarchy where it's travel up and down the hierarchy which large companies often construct this hierarchy of managers where no one manager if you ask them the question of like what have you done this week the answer is like it's really hard to come up with usually it's gonna be a bunch of paperwork yeah so you're like nobody knows what they actually do so when it's flat you can actually get as quickly as possible when problems arise you you can you can solve those problems as quickly as possible and also you have a direct rapid iterative process where you're making things simpler making them more efficient and constantly improving so yeah yeah it's it's interesting well when large i mean you see this in government a lot of people get together a hierarchy is developed and that somehow sometimes it's good but very often just slows things down and you see great companies great great companies apple google meta they have to fight against that bureaucracy that builds the slowness that large organizations have and to still be a big organization and act like a startup is the big challenge it's super difficult to deconstruct that as well once it's in place right it's circumventing layers and asking questions probing questions of people on the ground level is a huge challenge to the authority of the hierarchy and there's a tremendous amount of resistance to it so it's how do you grow something in the case of a company in terms of a culture that can scale but doesn't lose its connection to to sort of real and meaningful feedback it's it's not not easy i've had a lot of conversations with jim keller who's this legendary engineer and leader and he he has talked about like you often have to kinda be a little bit of an asshole in the room not in a mean way but like it's uncomfortable yeah like a lot of these questions they're uncomfortable they break the kinda general politeness and civility that people have in communication when you get a meeting like nobody wants to be like can we do it way different everyone wants just just to like this lunch is coming up you know i have i have this trip planned on the weekend with the family everyone just wants comfort humans get together they kinda gravitate towards comfort nobody wants that one person that comes in and says hey can we like do this way better and way different and everything we've gotten comfortable with throw it out not only do they not want that but the one person who comes in and does that puts a massive target on their back and is ultimately seen as a threat i mean nobody really gets fired for maintaining the status quo even if things go poorly mhmm it's the way it was always done yeah humans are fascinating but in order to actually do great big projects yeah to to reach for the stars you have to have those people you have to you have you have to constantly disrupt and have those uncomfortable conversations and really have that first principles type of orientation especially in those large bureaucratic context so amongst many other things you created a fashion brand what was that about what was the origin of that i always loved fashion as a form of self expression as a means to to communicate either a truth or an illusion depending on what kind of mood you were in but this like sort of second body if you will so i loved fashion and look i mean my mother was a big part of the reason i did but i never thought i would go into fashion in fact i was graduating from wharton it was the day of my graduation and anna winter calls me up and and offered me a job at vogue which is a dream in so many ways but i was so focused i i wanted to go into real estate and i wanted to build buildings and and i and i told her that so i i really thought that that was going to be the path i was taking and then very organically fashion you know it was part of my life but it came it came into my life in a in a more professional capacity by talking with my first of of many different partners that i had in the fashion space about he he actually had shown me a building to buy his family had some real estate holdings and and i passed on on the real estate deal but we forged a friendship and we started talking about how in the space that he was in fine jewelry there was this lack of product and brands that were positioned for self purchasing females so everything was about you know the man buying the christmas gift the man buying the engagement ring the stores felt like that they were all tailored towards the male aesthetic the marketing felt like that and and what about the woman who had a salary and was really excited to buy herself a great pair of earrings or or had just received a great bonus and and was gonna use it to to treat herself so we thought there was a void in the marketplace and and that was the first category i launched ivanka trump fine jewelry and we just caught lightning in a bottle it was really quickly after that i met my partner who had founded nine west shoes really capable partner and we launched a shoe collection which which took off and did enormously well and then a clothing collection and handbags and sunglasses and fragrance so so we caught a moment and and we found a positioning for this for the self purchasing multidimensional woman and we made dressing for work aspirational at the time we launched if you wanted to buy something for an office context like the brands that existed were the opposite of exciting like nobody was you know taking pictures of like what they were wearing to work and and and posting it online with some of these classic legacy brands really it felt very much like it was designed by a team of men for what a woman would wanna wear to the office so we started creating this clothing that was feminine that was beautiful that was versatile that would take a woman from the boardroom to an after school soccer game to a date night with a boyfriend to to a walk in the park with her husband like all the the different ways women live their lives and creating a wardrobe for that woman who works at every aspect of their life not just sort of the siloed professional part and and it was it was really compelling we started creating great brand content and we had incredible contributors like adam grant who was who was blogging for us at the time and and creating aspirational content for for working women it was actually a kind of a funny story but i now had probably close to eleven different product categories and we were growing like wildfire and i started to think about what would be a compelling way to sort of create interesting content for the people who are buying these these different categories and and we came up with a website called women who work and i i went to a marketing agency you know one of the fancy firms in new york and i said you know we wanna create a brand campaign around this multidimensional woman who works and and what do you think like can you help us and they come back and they say you know what we don't like the word work we think it should be women who do mhmm and i just started laughing because i'm like women who do and the fact that they couldn't conceive of it being sort of exciting and aspirational and interesting to sort of lean into to working at at all aspects of our lives was just fascinating to me but showed that that was part of the problem and and i think that's why ultimately i mean when the business grew to be hundreds of millions of dollars in in sales we were distributed at all the best retailers across the country from you know neiman marcus to saks to to bloomingdale's and beyond and and i think we it really resonated with people in in an amazing way and and probably not dissimilar to how i have this incredible experience every time somebody comes up to me and tells me that that they were married in a space that i had painstakingly designed i have that experience now with with my fashion company the number of women who will come up tell me that they they loved my shoes or they loved the handbags and i've had women show me their engagement rings they got engaged with us and it's really rewarding it's really beautiful yeah when i was hanging out with you in miami the number of women that came up to you say they love the the clothing they love the shoes this is awesome all all these years later all these years later yeah what does it take to make a shoe where somebody would come up to you years later and just be just full of love for this thing you've created what's what's that mean like what does it take to do that well i still wear the shoes so i mean that's a good starting point right is to create a thing that you want to wear i feel like the the product i think first and foremost you have to have the the right partner so shoe building a shoe if you talk to a great shoe designer it's architecture making a heel that's four inches that feels good to walk in for eight hours a day that is an engineering feat and so i found great partners in everything that i did my my shoe partner had founded nine west so he really knew what went into making a shoe wearable and comfortable and then you overlay that with great design and and we also created this really comfortable beautifully designed super feminine product offering that was also affordably priced so i think it was like the trifecta of those of those three things that that made that i think it made it stand out for so many people can you speak to i don't know if it's possible to articulate but can you speak to the process you go through from idea to the final thing like what you go through to bring an idea to life so not being a designer and this is true in real estate as well i was never the architect so i didn't necessarily have the pen and in fashion the same way it was kind of like a conductor i knew what i liked and didn't like and i think that's really important and that became honed for me over time so i would have to sit a lot longer with something earlier on than later when i had more refined my aesthetic point of view and so i think first of all you have to have a pretty strong sense of of what resonates with you and and then as in the case of my fashion business as it grew and became quite a large business and i had so many different categories everything had to work together so i had individual partners for each category but if we were selling at neiman marcus we couldn't have a pair of shoes that didn't relate to a dress that didn't relate to a pair of sunglasses and handbags all on the same floor so you know in the beginning it was much more collaborative as time passed i i really sort of took the point on deciding and this is the aesthetic for the season these are the colors we're gonna use these are fabrics and then working with our partners on the execution of that but i i needed to create an overlay that allowed for cohesion as the collection grew and and that was actually really fun for me because that was a little different you know i was typically initially responding to things that were put in front of me and towards the end i was it was my partners who were responding to the things that myself and my team but it's still it's you know i would always i always wanted to bring the best talent in so i was i was hiring great designers and printmakers and and copywriters and so i had this you know almost like that conductor analogy i had this incredible group of in this case women assembled to who had very strong points of view themselves and and it created an a great team so yeah i mean great team is really sort of essential it's it's it's the essential thing behind any successful story hundred percent but there's this thing of taste which is really interesting because it's hard to kinda articulate what it takes but basically knowing a versus b what looks good or without a b comparison to say like if we did if we change this part that would make it better that sort of designer taste it's hard to make explicit what that is but the great designers like have that taste like this is gonna look good and it's not actually again the steve jobs thing is not the opinion poll like you can't poll people and ask them what looks better it's you you have to have the vision of that yeah and as you said you also have to develop eventually the confidence that your taste is is good such that you can like curate you can direct teams you can argue that no no no this is right even when there's several people that say this doesn't make any sense if you have that vision have the confidence yeah this will look good that's how you come up with great designs because it's a mix a mixture of great taste that you develop over time and the confidence and and that's a really hard thing especially and i think one of the things that i love most about all of these creative pursuits is that ability to to work with the best people right now i'm working with my husband we have this fourteen hundred acre island in the mediterranean and we're building bringing in the best architects and the best brands and but to have a point of view and to challenge people who are such artists respectfully but not to be afraid to to ask questions it takes a lot of confidence to do that and and it's hard so these are actually just internal early renderings so we're in the process of doing the master planning now but this is beautiful i mean it's yeah it's just an early vision yeah it's gonna be extraordinary aman's gonna operate the hotel for us and there are gonna be villas and we have carbone who's gonna be doing the food and beverage and but it's it's amazing to bring together all of this talent and for me to be able to play around and flex the the real estate muscles again and and have some fun with it is the real estate the design the the art how hard is it to bring something like that to life because that's like that looks surreal out of this world well especially on an island it's it's challenging meaning the logistics of even getting the building materials execute on it so and it it may not be this this is sort of as i said early conceptual drawings but it gives a sense of sort of wanting to honor the topography that exists and you know this is obviously very modern but making it feel right in terms of the context of of the vegetation and and the terrain that exists is and not just have you know a beautiful glass box obviously you want glass you wanna look out and see that gorgeous blue ocean but but how do you do that in a way that doesn't feel generic and isn't a squandered opportunity to create something new yeah and it's integrated with the natural landscape it's it's a celebration of the natural landscape around it so so i guess you start from this dream like because this feels like a dream and then when you're faced with the reality of the building materials and all the actual constraints of the building then it evolves from there right yeah and and so much i mean so much of architecture you don't see but it's decisions made so how do you how do you create independent structures where you look out of one and don't see the other mhmm you know how do you ensure the sort of the stacking and the master plan works in a way that's harmonious and view corridors and all of those elements all of those components of decision making are super appreciated but not often thought about what's a view corridor like to make sure that the top unit you're not looking out and seeing a whole bunch of units you're looking out and seeing the ocean ocean so that's where you take this and then you start angling everything and you start thinking about well in this context do we have green roofs so if there's any hint of a roof it's camouflaged by vegetation that matches what already exists on the island it's where the engineers become very important well yeah so there how do you build into a mountainside while being sensitive to to the beauty and of the island it's almost like a mathematical problem i took a class computational geometry in grad school where you have to think about these view corridors it's like a math problem yeah well but it's also an art problem because it's not just about making sure that there's no occlusions to the view you have to figure out when there is occlusions like what is the vegetation is it so you have to figure all that out and there's probably so every single every single room every single building is a is a thing that adds extra complexity and then the choices like how does the sun rise and set yeah so how do you wanna angle the hotel in relation that's awesome to the sunrise and the sunset do you you obviously want people to experience those so which do you favor mhmm the directionality of the wind and on on an island and you know in this case the wind is coming from the north and the vegetation is less lush on the northern end so do you focus more on the south southern end and have you know the horseback riding trails and amenities up towards the the north so there are these really interesting decisions and and choices you get to reflect on that's a fascinating sort of discussion to be having and probably there's like actual constraints on like infrastructure issues so all of those constraints grade of the land right if it's super steep so also finding the areas of topography that are flatter but still have the great views so it's it's fun it's i think real estate and building it's like a giant puzzle and i love puzzles every piece relates to another and it's all sort of interconnected yeah like you said no post office like the every single room is different so every single room is a puzzle when you're doing the renovation yeah that's fascinating and if you're not thoughtful like it's like at best really quirky at worst completely ridiculous quirky is such a funny word it's such a like a walked into i'm sure you've walked into your fair share of like quirky rooms yeah you know and sometimes like that's charming but most often it's charming when it's intentional yeah through like smart design yeah you can tell if it's by accident or if it's intentional yeah you can you can tell so much i mean the whole hospitality thing it's just not just like how it's designed it's how once the thing is operating if it's a hotel like how everything comes together yeah the the the culture of the place and the warmth yeah like i think with spaces they you can feel like the soul of a structure and i think on the hotel side you have to think about like flow of traffic use all these things when you're building condominiums or or your own home you wanna think about like the warmth of a space as well and especially with super modern design sometimes like warmth is sacrificed mhmm and i think there is a way to sort of marry both and and that's where you get into sort of the interior design elements and disciplines and how fabrics can create tremendous warmth in a space which is otherwise sort of colder raw building materials and that's a really interesting like how texture matters how color matters and i think oftentimes interior design is not it doesn't take the same priority and i think the i think that underestimates the impact it can have on how you experience a a room or a space yeah especially when it's working together with the with the architecture yeah yeah fabrics and color that's so interesting finishes you know the choice of wood that's making me feel horrible about the space we're sitting it's like black curtains the warmth i need to work on this no problem big two door this is a big two item you're making me you know i i'll listen back to this over and over need there may be a like a woman's touch needed a lot a lot i actually i appreciate the vegetation yeah it's fake plants you know what i love about this space though is it's is like you come through like every single element behind it there's a story behind it so it's not just some you didn't have some interior designer curate your bookshelf you know there's like nobody came in here with books by the yard this is basically an ikea like this is not this is not deeply thought through but it it does bring me joy yeah which is one way to do design as long as you're happy that usually means if your taste is decent enough that means others will be happy or we'll see the joy radiate through it but i appreciate you were grasping for compliments and you eventually got the no i actually i love it i love it do you have like a little i love this guy there's yeah you're you're holding on to to a monkey looking at a at a at a human skull which is particularly irrelevant and this i mean i feel like you've really thought about all of these yeah there's there's robot i don't know if i mean i don't know how much you've looked into robots but there's there's a way to communicate love and affection from a robot that i'm really fascinated by and a lot of cartoonists do this too you have to when you create cartoons and nonhuman like entities you have to bring out the joys of with wall e or the robots in in star wars to be able to communicate emotion to anger and excitement through a robot is really interesting to me and people that do it successfully are awesome are awesome make you smile yeah that makes me smile for sure there's a longing there how do you do that successfully as you as you bring them your projects to life i think there's there's so many detailed elements that i think artists know well but one basic one is something that people know and you now know because you have a dog is the excitement that a dog has when it when you first show up mhmm just the recognizing you and like catching your eye and just showing his excitement by wiggling his butt and tail and all this kind of this this intense joy that overtakes his body that that moment of recognizing something yeah it's the double take that you you're that that moment of like where this joy of recognition takes over your whole cognition and you're just like there and there's a connection and and then the other person gets excited and you both get excited together it's kinda like that feeling where would i put it you know like when you go to airports and you get to see people who haven't seen each other for a long time all of a sudden recognize each other in their meeting and they're all like run run towards each other in a hug and that moment but it's awesome to watch there's so much joy and and dogs though will have that every time you could walk into the other room to get a yeah glass of milk and you come back yeah and your dog sees you like it's the first time yeah so i love replicating that in robots they actually say children like one of the reasons why peekaboo is so successful is that they actually don't remember not having seen you a few seconds prior there's a there's a term for it but i remember as when when my kids were younger you leave the room and you walk back in thirty seconds later and they experience the same joy as if you had been you know gone for four hours and we grew out of that we've become very used to one another i kinda wanna forever be excited by the peekaboo phenomena the simple joys we're talking about on fashion having the confidence of taste to be able to sort of push through on this idea of a design but you've also mentioned somebody who admires rick rubin in his book the creative act it has some really interesting ideas and one of them is to accept self doubt and imperfection so is there some battle within yourself that you have on sort of striving for perfection and for the confidence and always kinda having it together versus like accepting that things are always going to be imperfect i think every day i think i wake up in the morning and you know i wanna be better i wanna be a better mom i wanna be a better wife i wanna be more creative i wanna be physically stronger and and so that very much lives within me all the time you know i think i i also grew up in the context of being the child of two extraordinarily successful parents and that could have been debilitating for me and i saw that in a in a lot of my friends who grew up in circumstances similar to that they were afraid to try for fear of of not measuring up and i think somehow early on i learned to kind of harness the fear of not being good enough not being competent enough and i harnessed it to make me better and and to push me outside of my comfort zone so i think that's always lived with me and and and i think it probably always will i think you have to have humility in anything you do that you could be better mhmm and and strive for that i think as you get older it it softens a little bit as you have more reps you know as you have more examples of of having been thrown in the deep end and figured out how to swim you you get a little bit more comfortable in your sort of abstract competency but if that fear is not in you i think you're not challenging yourself enough harness the fear the other thing he writes about is intuition that you need to trust your instincts and intuition that's a very recoupment thing to say but so what percent of your decision making is intuition or what percent is through rigorous careful analysis would you say it's both it's like trust would verify yeah you know i think you i think that's also where age and experience comes into play because i think you always have sort of a gut instinct but i think intuition like well honed intuition comes from a place of of accumulated knowledge right so oftentimes when you feel really strongly about something it's because you've been there you know what's right or on a personal level if you're acting in accordance with your core values you know it just feels good and even if it would be the right decision for others if you're acting outside of of of your sort of integrity or core values it doesn't feel good and and it you know your intuition will signal that you'll never be you'll never be comfortable so i think because because of that i i start oftentimes with my intuition and then i and then i put it through like a rigorous test of of whether that is in fact true very seldom do i go against what my initial instinct was not at least at this point in my life yeah i had a actually a discussion yesterday with a big time business owner investor who who's talking about being impulsive and following that like on a phone call shifting like the entire everything they're giving away a very large amounts of money and moving it in another direction on an impulse making a promise that he can't at that time deliver but knows if he works hard he'll deliver and all doing just to be following that impulsive yeah feeling and he said now that you know he has he has a family that probably some of their impulse has quieted down a little bit he's more rational and thoughtful and so on but wonders whether it's sometimes good to just be impulsive and to just trust your gut and just go with it don't deliberate too long because then you won't you won't do it it's interesting the it's the confidence of stupidity maybe of youth that leads to some of the greatest breakthroughs and yeah it's like there's a cost to wisdom and deliberation there there is but i i actually think in this case as you get older you may act less impulsively but i think you're more like attuned with you have more experience so your gut is like more well honed you know so your instincts are more well honed i think i i found that to be true for me mhmm you know it doesn't feel as like reckless as when i was younger amongst many other things you were on the apprentice yeah people love you on there people love the show so what did you learn about business about life from the various contestants on there well i think you can learn everything about life from joe rivers so i'm just i'm got it just that one human yeah amazing but you know i it was it was such a wild experience for me because i was i was quite young when i was on it just getting started in business and it was the number one television show in the country and it went on to be syndicated all over the world and it was just this wild like phenomenal success you know a business show had never had never crossed over in this sort of way so it was really a moment in time and you had regular apprentice and then the celebrity apprentice but but the tasks i mean they they went on to be studied at business schools across the country so every other week i'd be reading case studies of how the apprentice was being examined and taught to classes and this university in boston or you know so it was extraordinary and and this was like a real life classroom i was in so i think because of the nature of the show you learn a lot about you know teamwork and you're watching it and analyzing it real time you learned a lot about a lot of the tasks were very marketing oriented because of you know the short duration of time they had to to execute a lot of you learned a lot about time management because of that short duration so you know almost every episode would devolve into people hysterical over the fact that they had ten minutes left to with this herculean lift ahead of them so so it was it was a fascinating it was a fascinating experience for me and and we would be filming i mean we would film first thing in the morning at like five or six am in trump tower oftentimes like in the lobby of trump tower that's where the war rooms and boardrooms of the candidates where the contestants were and then we would go up in the elevator to our office we would work all day and then we'd come down and we'd evaluate the task so it was this weird like real life television thing experience in the middle of our sort of on the bookends of our workday so it was it was intense so you're you're like curating the television version of it and also living it well living the and oftentimes there was like an overlay like there were episodes that they came up with brand campaigns for my shoe collection or my clothing line or or design challenges related to you know a hotel i was responsible for for building so there was this unbelievable crossover that was obviously great for us from a business perspective but it's sometimes surreal to to experience what was it like was it was it scary to be in front of a camera when you know so many people watch i mean that that's a new experience for you at that time just the number of people watching yeah was that weird it was really weird i i really struggled watching myself on the episodes like i really i still to this day like television as a medium like the fact that we're taping this yeah i'm more self conscious than if we weren't i i just it's hey i have to watch myself as an after after we record this before i publish it i have to listen to my stupid self talk so and so you're saying it doesn't get better it doesn't get better i i still i hear myself i'm like does my voice really sound like that you know yeah why do i do this thing or that thing and i i find that some people are super at ease and and who knows maybe they're not either but some people feel like they're super at ease they are yeah you know my father was i think like who you who you saw is who you get mhmm and i think that made him so effective in that medium because he was just himself and he was totally unselfconscious i was not i was totally self conscious so it was it it was extraordinary but but also a little challenging for me i think certain people are just like born to be entertainers like yeah elvis like on stage they come to life yeah this is where they this is where they're truly happy i've met i've met guys like that like great rock stars like this is where they they feel like they belong on stage it's it's not just a thing they do and they there's certain aspects they lost certain aspects they don't know this is where this this is where they're alive this is where they they've always dreamed of being this is where they want to be forever michael jackson was like that michael jackson i saw pictures of you hanging out with michael jackson that was cool he came once to a performance i wanted to be one moment in time i wanted to be a professional ballerina okay yes yes and i was you know working really hard i was going to the school of american ballet i was dancing at the lincoln center in the nutcracker i i was super serious you know nine ten year old and and my parents came to a christmas performance of the nutcracker and my father brought michael jackson with him and everyone was so excited that all the dancers they wore one glove but i remember he was so shy he was so quiet when you'd see him like in in smaller group settings and then you'd watch him walk onto stage and it was like a completely different person like the vitality that came into him and you say that's like someone on who was born to do what he did and and i think there are a lot of performers like that and i just in general love to see people that have found the thing that makes them come alive yeah like i as i mentioned went to the jungle recently with paul roseley and he's a guy who just belongs in the jungle yeah like that's a guy where like when i saw i got a chance to go with him from the city to the jungle and you just see this person change of the happiness the the the joy he has when he first is able to jump in the water in the amazon river and to feel like he's home with with the crocodiles and all that and with the he's calling friends and probably dances around in the trees with the monkeys so he like he this is this is where he belongs i love seeing that you felt that i mean i i watched the interview you did with him and and he felt that like you his passion and enthusiasm like it radiated and capped i mean i'm i love animals like i love all animals never loved snakes so much and he almost made me now i appreciate the beauty of them much more than i did prior to listening to him speak about them but it it's an infectious thing he actually we're talking about skyscrapers before i loved he called trees skyscrapers of life and i thought that was so great yeah and they are they're so big i mean just like skyscrapers or large buildings they also represent a history especially in europe i like to think look at me all these ancient buildings you like to think of all the people throughout history that have looked at them have admired them have been inspired by them you know great leaders of history yeah in france it's like napoleon just the history that's contained within a building you almost feel the energy of that history you could feel the stories emanate from the buildings in that same way when you look at giant trees that have been there for for decades for centuries in some cases you you feel the history the stories emanate i got a chance to climb some of them so you feel like there's a visceral feeling of the power of the trees it's cool yeah that's an experience i'd love to have be that disconnected yeah being in the jungle among the trees among the animals you remember that you're forever a part of nature you're you're fundamentally our nature that this is a earth is a living organism and you're a part of that organism and that's humbling that's beautiful and you get to experience that in a real real way it sounds simple to say but when you actually like experience it it stays with you for a long time especially if you're out there alone i got i got a chance to spend time in the jungle solo just by myself and you you sit in the fear of that in the simplicity of that all of it and just no sounds of humans anywhere yeah you're just sitting there and listening to all the monkeys and the birds trying to have sex with each other all around you just screaming and there's like romance i mean i romanticize everything there's like birds that are monogamous for life like macaws you could see like two of them flying they're also by the way screaming at each other i always wonder like are they arguing or is this their love length like that's very funny just have these like two birds that you know have been together for a long time and they're just screaming at each other in the morning really funny because there aren't that many animal species that are monogamous and you highlighted one example but they literally sound like this it's just they're bickering but maybe it's to them it's beautiful you you know i don't wanna judge but they do sound very loud and very obnoxious but amidst all of that it's just i don't know i think it's so humbling to like feel so small too yeah like i feel like when we get busy and when we're running around it's easy to feel we're so in our head and we feel sort of so consequential like in the context of even our own lives and then you find yourself in a situation like that and it's i think you feel so much more connected knowing how minuscule you are in the broader sense and i feel that way when i'm on the ocean on a surfboard you know you just it's it's really humbling to be so small amidst that vast sea and it feels it feels really beautiful you know with no noise no chatter no distractions just just being in the moment and it sounds like you experienced that in a very very real way in in the amazon yeah the power of the waves is cool i love swimming out into the ocean and feeling the power of the ocean beneath you and you're just like this speck and you can't fight it right you just have to sort of be in it and i think in surfing one of the things i love about it is i feel like a lot of water sports are like manipulating the environment and there's something that can be a little violent about it like you look at windsurfing whereas with surfing you're in harmony with it so you're not fighting it you're flowing with it and you still have like the agency of choosing which waves you're gonna surf and you sit there and you you read the ocean and and and you've learned to understand it but you can't control it what's it like to like like fall in your face when you're trying to surf like what i haven't surfed before it just feels like i always see videos of when everything goes great i just wonder like when it doesn't those are the ones people post no well i actually had the unique experience of one of my first times surfing i only learned a couple of years ago so i'm not good i just love it i love everything about it i love the physicality i love being in the ocean i love the everything about it the hardest thing with surfing is paddling out because when you're like committing you catch a wave obviously sometimes like you know you flip over your board and that doesn't feel great but when you're in sort of the line of impact and you've maybe surfed a good wave in and now you're going out for another set and you get sort of stuck in that impact line there's like nothing you can do you just sort of sit there and you try to dive underneath it and it will pound you and pound you so i've been stuck there while you know four five six waves just like crash on top of your head and and the worst thing you can do is get reactive and you know and scared and and try and fight against it you kind of just have to flow with it until inevitably there's a break and then paddle like hell back out to the line or to the beach whatever you know whatever you're feeling but it's that's to me that's the hardest part the paddling out how did life change when your father decided to run for president wow everything changed you know almost almost overnight we learned that he was planning to announce his candidacy two weeks before he actually did and nothing about our lives had been constructed with politics in mind you know i most often when people are exposed to politics at that level that sort of national level there's first like city council run and then maybe a state level run and and maybe maybe you know congress senator ultimately the presidency so it was unheard of to for him never to have run a campaign and then run for president and and win so it was it was an extraordinary experience there there was so much intensity and so much scrutiny and and so much noise so that took for sure like a moment to acclimate to not sure i ever fully acclimated but it it definitely was was a super unusual experience but i think then the the process that unfolded over over the next couple of years was also like the most extraordinary growth experience of my life you know suddenly i was going into communities that i probably never would have been to and i was talking with people who in thirty seconds would reveal to me their deepest insecurity their gravest fear their wildest ambitions all of it with the hope that in telling me that story it would get back to a potential future president of the united states and have impacts for their family for their community so the level of candor and vulnerability people have with you is unlike anything i've ever experienced and i've done the apprentice before people may know who i was in some of these situations that i was going into but they wouldn't have shared with me these things that you got the impression that oftentimes their own spouses wouldn't know and they wouldn't do so within thirty seconds so you learn so much about what motivates people what drives people what their concerns are and you grow so much as a result of it so when you're in the white house people unlike in any other position people have a sense that all the troubles they're going through maybe you can help yeah and so they put it all out there and and and they do so in such a raw vulnerable and real way it's it's shocking and eye opening and and super motivating i remember once i was in new hampshire and early on right after my father had had announced his candidacy and a man walks up to me in in the greeting line and within around five seconds he had started to tell me a story about how his daughter had died of an overdose and how he was worried his son was also it's something it's something that i would experience every day in talking with people and those stories just stay with you always you know i i took a long road trip around the united states in my twenties and i'm kinda thinking of doing it again just just for like a couple of months for that exact purpose and you can get these stories when you go to like a bar in the middle of nowhere and just sit and talk to people and they start sharing and it's it's it reminds you like how beautiful the country is it reminds you several things one that people well it shows you that there's a lot of different accents that's one but aside from that the people are struggling with all the same stuff yeah and at least at that time i wonder what it is now but at that time i don't remember on the surface there's like political divisions there's republicans and democrats and so on but like underneath it there are people who are all the same the concerns are all the same there's not that much of a division right now the the surface division has been amplified even more maybe because of social media i don't know why so i would love to see what the country is like now but i suspect probably it's still not as divided as it appears to be on the surface what the media shows what the social media shows but what did you experience in terms of the the division i think couple reactions to what you just said i think the first is your when you connect with people like that you are so inspired by their courage you know in the face of adversity and their resilience and it's like a truly remarkable experience for me the campaign lifted me out of a bubble i didn't even know i was in you know i i grew up on the upper east side of new york and i felt like i was well traveled and well educated and i believed at the time that i'd been exposed to divergent viewpoints and i realized during the campaign how limited my exposure had been relative to what it was becoming so there was a lot of there was a lot of growth in that as well but i do think you know you think about the vitriol and politics and you know whether it's worse than it's been in the past or not i think that's up for debate i think you know few there have been duels and there's been screaming and there's you know politics has always been a blood sport and it's always been incredibly vicious i think in the toxic swirl of social media it's more amplified and there's more sort of democratization around participating in it perhaps and it seems like the voices are louder but it's always been it feels like it's always been that but i don't believe most people are like that and and you know you you meet people along the way and they're not leading with what their politics are you know they're they're telling you about their hopes for themselves and their communities and and it makes you feel that we are a whole lot less divided than you know the media and others would have us believe although i have to say having duels sounds pretty cool maybe i just romanticize westerns anyway alright i miss movies okay but it's true like you read some of the stuff like in terms of what politics used to be in the history of the united states those those folks went pretty rough like way rougher actually but they didn't have social media so they had to go like real hard and the media was rough too so all like the the fake news all of that that's not recent it's it's it's been nonstop you know i look at the surface division the surface bickering and that might be like just a feature of democracy that's it's not a bug of democracy it's a feature we're in a constant conflict and it's the way we resolve we try to figure out the right way forward so in the moment it feels like people are just tearing each other apart but really we're trying to find a way where like in the long arc of history it will look like progress but in the short term it just sounds like people making stories up about each other and calling each other names and all this kind of stuff but in the there's a purpose to it i mean that's what freedom looks like i guess is what i'm trying to say and it's better than the alternative well i i think that the vast majority of people aren't participating in it sure yes that's true also you know i think there's a minority of people that are doing most of the yelling and screaming yeah and the majority of americans just wanna send their kid to a great school and want their communities to thrive and want to be able to realize their their dreams and aspirations so i saw a lot more of that than it would feel obvious if you looked at like a twitter feed mhmm what went into your decision to join the white house as an adviser you know the campaign i never i never thought about joining it was kinda like get to the end of it and when it started i was like everything in my life was almost firing on all cylinders i had two young kids at home during the course of the campaign i ended up i was pregnant with my third so this young family my businesses real estate and and fashion and working alongside my brothers running the trump hotel collection and we had so many my life was full and busy and and so there was a big part of me that was just wanted to get through just get through it without really thinking forward to what but when my father won he asked jared and i to join him and in asking that question you know keep in mind he was a total outsider so there was no bench of people as he would have today he had never spent the night in washington dc before yeah staying in the white house and so when he asked us to join him he trusted us he trusted in our ability to to execute and there wasn't a part of me that could imagine the seventy or eighty year old version of myself looking back and having been okay with having said no and going back to my life as i knew it before i mean in retrospect i realized there is no life as you know it before you know but but just the idea of of of not saying yes wherever that would lead me and and so i i dove in you know i was also during the course of the campaign i was just much more sensitive to the problems and experiences of americans i i gave you an example before of of the the father in new hampshire but but even just in my consumption of information i you know i had a a business that was predominantly young women you know many of which were thinking about having a kid had just had a child were planning on that life event and i knew what they needed to be able to show up every day and and realize this dream for themselves and and the support structures they would need to have in place and i remember reading this article at the time in one of the major newspapers of of a woman she had had a very solid job working at one of the blue chip accounting firms and the recession came she lost her job around the same time as her partner left her and over a matter of months she lost her home so she wound up with her two young kids after bouncing around between neighbors living in their car she gets a callback from one of the many interviews she had done for a second interview where she was all but guaranteed the job should that go well and she had arranged childcare for her two young children with with a neighbor in her old apartment block and the morning of the interview she shows up and the neighbor doesn't answer the doorbell and stands for five ten minutes doesn't answer so she has a choice does she go to the interview with her children or does she try to cancel she gets in her car drives to the interview leaves her two children in the back seat of the car with the window cracked goes into the interview and gets pulled out of the interview by police because somebody had called the cops after seeing her her children in the back seat of the car she gets thrown in jail her kids get taken from her and she spends years fighting to regain custody and i think about that's an extreme example but i think about something like that and i say if i was the mother and we were homeless like would i have gone to that interview and i i probably would've and that is not like an acceptable situation you know so you you hear stories like that and then you get asked will you come with me and it's really hard to say no and i spent four years in washington i feel like i left it all in the field i feel really good about it and and i'm i feel really privileged to have been able to do what i did a chance to help to help many people saying no means you're kinda turning away from those people so you felt like that to me yeah yeah but then it's the turmoil of politics that you're getting into and it really is a leap into the abyss what was it like trying to get stuff done in washington in this place where politics is a game it feels that way maybe from an outsider perspective and you go in there trying given some of those stories trying to help people what's it like to get anything done it's an incredible cognitive lift that's that's a nice way to put it yeah to to get things done you know there are a lot of people who would prefer to cling to the problem and their talking points about how they're gonna solve it rather than sort of roll up their sleeves and do the work it takes to build coalitions of support and find people who are willing to compromise and move the ball and so it's extremely difficult and you know jared and i talk about all the time it it probably should be because these are highly consequential policies that impact people's lives at scale shouldn't be so easy to do them and they are doable but it's challenging you know one of the first experiences i had where it really was just a full grind effort was with tax cuts and and the work i did to get the child tax credit doubled as part of it and it just meant meeting after meeting after meeting after meeting with lawmaker convincing them of why this is good policy going into their districts campaigning in their districts helping them convince their constituents of of why it's important of why child care support is important of why paid family leave is important of different policies that impact working american families so it's it's hard but it's it's it's really rewarding and then to get it done i mean just the child tax credit alone forty million american families got an average of two thousand two hundred dollars each year as a result of the doubling of the child tax credits that's one component of tax cuts when i was like researching this stuff you just get to think the scale of things the scale of impact is forty million families each one of those is a story it's a story of struggle of trying to give a large part of your life to a job while still being able to give love and support and care to family to kids and to manage all of that each one of those is a little puzzle that they have to solve and it's a life and death puzzle it's a you can lose your your home your security you can lose your job you can screw stuff up with parenting so you can mess all that up and you're trying to hold it together and government policies can help make that easier or can in some cases make that possible and you get to do that at a scale not of like five or ten families but like forty million families and that's just one thing yeah the people who shared with me their experience and you know during the campaign it was what they hoped to see happen once you were in there it was what they were seeing what they were experiencing the result of the policies and and that was that was the fuel you know on the hardest days like that was the fuel child tax credit i remember visiting with a woman britney houseman she came to the white house she had two small children she was pregnant with her third her husband was killed in a car accident she was in school at the time her dream was to become a criminal justice advocate that was no longer on the table for her after he passed away and she became the sole earner and provider for her family and she couldn't afford childcare she couldn't afford to stay in school so she ended up creating a childcare center in her home and her center was so successful because in part of different policies we worked on including the childcare block grants that went to the state she ended up opening additional centers i visited her at one of them in colorado now she has like a huge focus on helping teenage moms who don't have the resources to afford quality childcare for their kids come into her centers and programs and you know it's stories like that of the hardships people face but also what they do with opportunity when they're given it that really like powers you through tough moments when you're in washington what what can you say about the process of like bringing that to life so the the child tax credits so doubling them from a thousand two thousand per child well like what are the challenges of that getting people to compromise i'm sure there's a lot of politicians playing games with that because maybe it's a republican that came up with an idea or a democrat that came up with an idea and so they don't wanna give credit to the idea and that's probably all kinds of games happening where they when the game is happening you probably forget about the families each politician thinks about how they can benefit themselves you forget like the serving part of the role you're supposed to be in there were definitely people i met with in washington who i felt that was true of but you know they all go back to their districts and i assume that they all have similar experiences to what i had where people share their stories so there'd be something really cynical about thinking they forget but you know some do you helped get people together what's that take trying to get people to compromise trying to get people to see the common humanity i think first and foremost you have to be willing to talk with them so you know one of the policies i advocate for was paid family leave we left and nine million more americans had it through a combination of securing it for our federal workforce i i had people in the white house who were pregnant who didn't have access to to paid leave so we want to keep people attached to the workforce yet when they have an important life event like a child we create an impossibility for that some people don't even have access to unpaid leave if they're part time workers so that and and then we also put in place the first ever national tax credit for workers making under seventy two thousand dollars a year where employers could then offer it to their workers that was also part of tax cuts so you know part of it is is really taking taking the arguments as to why this is good smart well designed policy to people and you know it was one of my big surprises that on certain policy issues that i thought would have been well socialized the policies that existed were never shared across the aisle so people just lived with them maybe in hopes that one day they would have the votes to get exactly what they want but i was surprised by how little discussion there was so so i think part of it is be willing to have those tough discussions with people who may not share your viewpoint and be an active listener when they point out flaws and they have suggestions for changes not believing that you have a monopoly on good ideas and i think there has to be a lot of humility in architecting these things and a policy should benefit from that type of well rounded input yeah and be able to see like you said well designed policies there's probably like the details are important too like there's just just like with architecture and you walk the rooms there's probably really good designs of policies like economic policy that helps families that delivers the maximum amount of money or resources to families that need it and is not a waste of money so like that there's a probably really nice designs there and nice ideas that are bipartisan it has nothing to do with politics it has to do with just great economic policy it's great policies and that requires listening requires trust too trust like i learned tax cuts was really interesting for me because i met with so many people across the political spectrum on advancing that policy i really figured out who was willing to deviate from their talking points when the door was closed and who wasn't you know and it takes some courage to do that especially without surety that it would actually get done you know especially if they've campaigned on something that was slightly different and you know not everyone has that courage so through tax cuts i i learned the people who did have that courage and i went back to that well time and time again on policies that that i thought was were important you know some were were bipartisan the great american outdoors act is something it's incredible policy i love that one yeah it's amazing it's one of the largest pieces of conservation legislation since the national park system was created and you know over three hundred million people visit our national parks the vast majority of them being americans every year so this is something that is real and beneficial for people's lives getting rid of the deferred maintenance permanently funding them but there are other issues like that that just weren't being prioritized modernizing perkins cte you know and vocational education and it's something i became super passionate about and helped lead the charge on i think in in america for a really long period of time we've really believed that education stops when you leave high school or college and that is not true and that's a dangerous way to think so how can we both galvanize the private sector to ensure that they continue to train workers for the jobs they know are coming and how they train their existing workforce into the new jobs with robotics or machinery or new technologies that are coming down the pike so galvanizing the private sector to join us in in in that effort so whether it's the legislative side like the actual legislation of of perkins ct which was focused on on vocational education or whether it's the ability to use the white house to galvanize the private sector we got over sixteen million commitments from the private sector to retrain or reskill workers into the jobs of tomorrow yeah there's so many aspects of education that you helped on access to stem and computer science education so the the ct thing you're mentioning modernizing career and technical education that's millions and millions of people the act provided nearly one point three billion dollars annually to more than thirteen million students to better align the employer needs and all that kind of stuff very large scale policies that help a lot of people it's fascinating education often isn't like the bright shiny object everyone's running towards so one of the hard things in in politics when there's something that is good policy sometimes it has no momentum because it doesn't have a cheerleader so where are areas of good policy that you can like literally just carry across the finish line because people tend to run towards what's the news of the day sort of to try to address whatever issue is being talked about on on the front pages of papers and there's so many issues that that need to be addressed and you know education is one of them that's just under prioritized you know human trafficking that's an issue that i didn't go to the white house thinking i would work on but you hear a story of a survivor and you can't not want to eradicate one of the greatest evils that the mind can even imagine you know the trafficking of people the exploitation of children and i think for so many they assume that this is a problem that doesn't happen on our shores you know it's something that that you may experience at far flung destinations across the world but it's happening there and it's happening here as well and so through a coalition of people that on both sides of the aisle that i came to trust and and to work well with we were able to get legislation which the president signed passed nine pieces of legislation combating trafficking at home and abroad and digital exploitation of children how much of a toll does that take seeing all the problems in the world at such a large scale the immensity of it all was that hard to walk around with that just knowing how much suffering there is in the world as you're trying to help all of it as you're trying to design government policies to help all of that it's also a very visceral recognition that there is suffering in the world yeah how difficult is that to walk around with you feel it intensely you know we were just talking about human trafficking i mean you don't design these policies in the absence of the input of survivors themselves so you hear their stories remember a woman who was really influential in my thinking andrea hipwell who she was in college where she was lured out by a guy she thought was a good guy started dating him he gets her hooked on drugs convinces her to drop out of college and spends the next five years selling her she only got out when she was arrested and all too often that's happening too that the victim's being targeted not the perpetrator so we did a lot with doj around changing that and but now she's helping other survivors get skills and job training and the therapeutic interventions they need but you you speak with people like andrea and so many others and i mean you can't not your your part gets seized by it and it's it's both it's motivating and it's hard it's really hard i was just talking to a brain surgeon many of the surgery has to do he knows the chances are very low of success and he says that that wears at his armor yeah it chips away it's like only so many times can you do that and thank god he's doing it because i bet you there are a lot of others that don't choose that particular field because of those low success rates but you could see the pain in his eyes like maintaining your humanity while doing all of it you could see the story the you could see the family that loves that person just you feel the immensity of that and you you you you you feel the heartbreak involved with mortality in that case and with suffering also in that case and in general in all these human trafficking but even in helping families try to stay afloat trying to break out or escape poverty all that you get to see those stories of struggle it's not easy but the people that really feel the humanity of that feel the pain of that are probably the right people to be politicians but it's probably also why you can't stay in there too long it's the only time in my life where you actually feel like there's always a conflict right between work and life and making sure you know i as a woman i'd often get asked about you know how do you balance work and and family and and i never i never liked that question because balance it's like elusive right you're you're one yeah fever away from like no balance you know like your child's sick one day what do you do there goes balance or you know you have a huge project with a deadline there goes balance like i think a better way to frame it is am i living in accordance with my priorities maybe not every day but every week and every month and and reflecting on have you architected a life that aligns with your priorities so that more often than not you're where you need to be in that moment and service at that level was the one time where you really you feel incredibly conflicted about having any priorities other than serving it's finite you know in every business i've built you're building for duration you know and then you go into the white house and it is sand through an hour glass whether it's four years or eight years it's a finite period of time you have and most people don't last four years i think the average in the white house is eighteen months it's exhausting but it's the only time when you're at home with your own children that you feel you think about all the people you've met and you feel guilty about any time that's spent not advancing those interests in to the best of your capacity and that's a hard that's a hard thing that's a really hard feeling as a parent and it's really challenging then to be to be present to always need to answer your phone to always need to be available it's it's very difficult it's taxing but it's it's also the greatest privilege in the world so through that the turmoil of that the hardship of that what was through all the family through all that jared and the kids what was that like that was that was everything you know to have that to have the support systems i had in place with with my husband and you know we had we had left new york and wound up in washington in new york i lived ten blocks away from my mother-in-law who if i wasn't taking my kids to school she was so we lost some of that which was very hard but we had what mattered which was each other and you know my kids were young when i got to washington theo my youngest was eight months old and arabella my oldest my daughter was five years old so they were still quite young we have a son joseph who's three and and i think for me like the dose of levity coming home at night and having them there and just joyful and it was super grounding and important for me i still remember theo when he was around three three and a half years old jared used to make me coffee every morning and it was like my great luxury that i would sit there he still makes it for me every morning i told him i'm never even though i i secretly know how to actually work the coffee machine but i've convinced him that i have no idea how to work the coffee machine now i'm gonna be busted but it's a skill i don't wanna learn because it's it's one of his like acts of love he brings me coffee every morning in bed while i read the newspapers and and theo would watch this and so he got jared to teach him how to make coffee and theo learned how to make like a full blown cappuccino nice and he was so he had so much joy in every morning bringing me this cappuccino and i remember like the sound of his little steps you know like the slide it's he was so cute coming down the hallway with my like perfectly foamed cappuccino now i try to get him to make me coffee and he's like come on mom like are you that was a moment in time but we had a lot of like little moments like that that were just amazing so yeah i i got a chance to chat with him and he has a his silliness and sense of humor is yeah it's really joyful yeah i could see how that could be an escape from the madness in washington of the adult life the quote adult life we really kept like our home life pretty sheltered from everything else and we were able to do so because they were so young and because they weren't connected to the internet they were too young for smartphones all of these things we were able to shelter and protect them and allow them to have as normal as upbringing as was possible in the context we were living and and they brought me like and continue to bring me so much so much joy but they were i mean without jared and without the kids it it would have been much more lonely so three kids you've now upgraded two dogs and a hamster well our second dogs we we rescued him thinking he we thought he was probably like part german shepherd part lab is what we were told mhmm he's now i don't even know if he qualifies as a dog he's like the size of a horse yeah a small horse simba yeah simba so i don't think he has much lab in him i think we joseph has not wanted to do a dna test because he really wanted a german shepherd so he's a german shepherd yeah he's he's gigantic and we also have a hamster who's the newest addition because my son theo he tried to get he tried to get a dog as well our first dog winter became my daughter's dog as she wouldn't let her brothers play with him or sleep with him and was old enough to bully them into submission so then joseph wanted a dog and got simba theo now wants the dog and has buster the hamster in the interim so we'll see what advice would you give to other mothers just having planning on having kids and maybe advice yourself on figuring out this puzzle i think being a parent you have to cultivate within yourself like heightened levels of empathy you have to really look at each child and see them for who they are what they enjoy what they love and and and meet them where they're at and i think that can be enormously challenging when your kids are so different in temperament you know as they get older that difference in temperament may be within the same child depending on the moment of the day but it's it really i think it's actually made me a much softer person a much better listener i think i see people more truly for for who they are as opposed to how i want them to be sometimes and i think being a parent to three children who are all exceptional and all incredibly different has has enabled that in me i think for for me though they've also been like some of my greatest teachers in that we were talking about the the presence you felt when you were in the jungle and the the connectivity you felt and sort of the simple joy and i think for for us as we grow older we kinda disconnect from that like my kids have taught me how to play again and that's beautiful i remember just a couple of weeks ago we had one of these crazy miami torrential downpours and arabella comes down it's around eight o'clock at night it's it's really raining and she's got rain boots and pajama pants on and she's gonna take the dogs for a walk in the rain which you know she had all day to walk but she but she wasn't doing it because they needed to go for a walk she was like this would be fun yeah and i'm standing at the doorstep watching her and she goes out with simba and wynter this massive dog and this little tiny dog and i'm watching her walk to the end of the driveway and she's just dancing and it's pouring and i took off my shoes and i went out and i joined her and we danced in the rain and even as like a preteen who normally you know she like allowed me to experience the joy with her and it was it was amazing we can be so much more fun if we allow ourselves to be more playful we can be so much more present i look at theo loves games so we play a whole lot of board games any kind of game so it started with board games we do a lot of puzzles then it became card games i just taught him how to play poker nice he he loves backgammon like any kind of game and he's so fully in them you know when he plays he plays my son joseph he loves nature and he'll say to me sometimes when like i'm taking a picture of something he's observing like a beautiful sunset he's like mom just experience it i'm like yes you're right joseph just experience it you know so so they've those kids have taught me so much about sort of reconnecting with what's real and what's true and being present in the moment and and experiencing joy they almost give you permission to sort of reignite the inner child just be a kid again yeah and it it's interesting what you said that the puzzle of noticing each human being like what makes them beautiful the the unique characteristics like what they're good at yeah the way they want to be mentored like i i often see that especially with coaches and athletes young athletes aspiring to be great each athlete needs to be trained in a different way like i for example with some you need a softer approach like with me i always like like a dictatorial approach i like the coach to be this like menacing figure that's when i that brought out the best in me i didn't wanna be friends with the coach like i wanna almost it's weird to say but yelled at like put to be pushed but that's doesn't work for everybody and that's a risk you have to take as a in the coach context of like because you can't just yell at everybody yeah you have to figure out like what does each person need and when you have kids i imagine the puzzle is even harder and when they all need different things but yet coexist and are sometimes competitive with one another so you'll be at a dinner table then the amount of times i get well that's not fair why did you let and i'm like life isn't fair and by the way like i'm not here to be fair i'm like i'm trying to give you each what you need mhmm especially when i've been working really hard and you know in the white house i'd say okay well now we have a sunday and we have these hours and i'll i'll have like a grand plan you know and we're gonna make it count and it's gonna involve you know hot chocolate and sleds you know whatever whatever it is that like my great adventure they we're gonna go play mini golf and then i come down all psyched up all ready to go and the kids have zero interest and there have been a lot of times where i've been like we're doing this thing and and then i realized wait a second you know like sometimes you just like plop down on the floor and start playing magna tiles you know and like that's where they need you mhmm and so so those of us who have sort of like alpha personalities who sometimes it's just just witness like witness what they need don't like play with them and allow them to lead the play don't force them down a road you may think is more interesting or productive or educational or edifying you know just just be with them observe them and and then show them that you are genuinely curious about the things that they are genuinely curious about i think there's a lot of love when you do that also there's just fascinating puzzles i was talking to a a friend yesterday and she has four kids and they fight a lot and she she generally wants to break up the fights but she's like i'm not sure if i'm just supposed to let them play can they figure it out yeah or you always break break him up because i'm told that it's okay for them to fight kids do that they kind of figure out their own situation that's part of like the growing up process but you wanna always especially if it's physical they're like pushing each other you wanna kinda stop it but at the same time it's also part of the play part of the dynamics and that that's a puzzle you also have to figure out and plus you're probably worried that they're gonna get hurt if they're well i think there's like when it gets physical yeah that's like okay we have to intervene i know you're into martial arts but but that's normally like the red line yes you know once it once it tips into that but there is always that you know like you have to allow them to problem solve for themselves like a little interpersonal conflict is is good it's really hard when you try to navigate something because everyone thinks you're taking their sides you have oftentimes incomplete information it's i think for parents what tends to happen too is we see our kids fighting with each other in a way that all kids do and we start to project into the future and like catastrophize you know if like my two sons are going through a moment where they're like oil and water anything one wants to do the other doesn't wanna do it's like a very interesting moment so my instinct is they're not gonna like each other when they're twenty five you know you sort of project into the future as opposed to recognizing this is a stage that i too went through and it's normal and it's not building it in your mind into into something that's unnecessarily consequential it's short term formative conflict yeah so ever since twenty sixteen the the number and the level of attacks you've been under has been steadily increasing has been super intense how do you walk through the fire of that you've been very stoic about the whole thing i've don't think i've ever seen you respond to an attack you just let it pass over you you stay positive and you focus on solving problems and you didn't engage while being in dc you didn't engage into the back and forth fire of the politics so what's your philosophy behind that i appreciate you're saying that i was very stoked about it i think you know i feel things pretty deeply so initially some of that really took me off guard like some of the derivative love and hatred some of the intensity of of of the attacks and there were times when it was it was so easy to counter it i'd even write something out and and say well i'm gonna i'm gonna press send and never did i i felt that sort of getting into the mud fighting back it didn't run true to who i am as a human being like it didn't it felt at odds with with who i am and how i wanna spend my time so i think as a result i was oftentimes on the receiving end of a lot of a lot of cheap shots and i'm okay with that because it's sort of the way i know how to be in the world i was focused on things i thought mattered more and you know i i think part of me also internalized there's a concept in judaism called blashenhara which is translated into i think quite literally evil speech and the idea that you know speaking poorly of another is almost the moral equivalent to murder because you can't really repair it you can apologize but you can't repair it another component of that is that it does as much damage to the person saying the words than it does to the person receiving them and i think about that a lot i talk about this concept with with my kids a lot and i'm not willing to pay the price of that fleeting and momentary satisfaction of of sort of swinging back because i think it would be it would be too expensive for my soul and and that's how i kind of made peace with it because i think that's just that feels more true for me but it is a little bit contrarian in politics it's it's definitely it's definitely a contrarian viewpoint to to not get into the fray actually someday i love dolly parton says that she doesn't condemn or criticize she loves and accepts and i like that it feels it feels right for me i also like that you said that words have power it's not sometimes people say well words when you speak negatively of others ah that's just words but i think there's a cost to that there's a cost like you said to your soul and there's a cost in terms of the damage you can do to the other person whether it's to their reputation publicly or to them privately just as a human being psychologically and it and in the place that it puts them because they think they start thinking negatively in general and then maybe they respond and there's this vicious downward spiral that happens that almost like we don't intend to but it destroys everybody in the process you quoted alan watts i love him in saying quote you're under no obligation to be the same person you were five minutes ago so how have the years in dc and the years after changed you i love alan watts too i i listen to his lecture sometimes falling asleep he's got like an on planes he's got like the most soothing voice but but i love what he said about you have no obligation to be who you were five minutes ago because we should always feel that we have the ability to evolve and grow and and and better ourselves i think further than that if we don't look back on her who we were a few years ago with some level of embarrassment we're not growing enough right so there's nothing i when i look back i'm like oh you know it's i feel like that that feeling is you know because you're growing into into hopefully you know sort of a better version of yourself and i hope and feel that that's been that's been true for me as well i think the person i am today you know we spoke in in the beginning of our discussion about some of my earliest ambitions in real estate and in fashion and those were amazing adventures and and incredible experiences in government and i feel today that all of those ambitions are more fully integrated into me as a human being i'm much more comfortable with the various pieces of my personality and that any professional drive is more integrated into more simple pleasures like everything for me has gotten like much simpler and easier in terms of what i wanna do and what i wanna be and and i think that's where you know my kids have been my teachers just being fully present and enjoying like the little moments and it it doesn't mean i'm any less like driven than i was before it's just more a part of me than being sort of the all consuming energy one has in their twenties yeah just like you said will your mom be able to let go yeah and enjoy the water the sun the beach yeah and enjoy the moment the simple the simplicity of the moment i think a lot about the fact that you know for for a lot of young people they they really know what they wanna do but they don't actually know who they are and then i think as you get older hopefully you know who you are and you're much more comfortable with ambiguity around what you wanna do and accomplish you're more flexible in your thinking around those things and give yourself permission to be who you are yeah you made the decision not to engage in the politics of the twenty twenty four campaign if it's okay let me read what you wrote on the topic quote i love my father very much this time around around i'm choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we're creating as a family i do not plan to be involved in politics while i will always love and support my father going forward i will do so outside the political arena i'm grateful to have had the honor of serving the american people and i will always be proud of many of our administration's accomplishments so can you explain your thinking your philosophy behind that decision i think first and foremost it was a decision rooted in me being a parent really thinking about what they need from me now you know politics is is a rough rough business and i think it's one that you also can't dabble in i think you have to either be all in or or all out and i know today the cost they would pay for me being all in emotionally in terms of my absence at such a formative point in their life and i'm not willing to make them bear that cost i served for four years and and feel so privileged to have done it but as their mom i think it's it's it's really important that i do what's right for them and and i think there are a lot of ways you can serve you know i think there's obviously we talked about the enormity the scale of what can be accomplished in in government service but you know i think there's something equally valuable about helping within your own community and i volunteer with the the kids a lot and we feel really good about that service it's different but it's no less meaningful so i think there are other ways there are other ways to serve i also think for you know politics is is a it's a pretty dark world like there's a lot of darkness a lot of negativity and it's just really at odds with what feels good for me as a human being and you know it is it it's a really it's a really rough business so so for me and my family it it feels right to not participate so it wears on your soul and yeah there is a bit at least from an outsider's perspective a bit of darkness in that part of our world i wish it didn't have to be this way me too i think part of that darkness is just watching all the legal turmoil that's going on what's it like for you to see that your father involved in that going through that on a human level it's my father and i love him very much so it's it's painful to experience but ultimately i wish it didn't have to be this way i like it that underneath all of this i love my father is the thing that you lead with that's so true it is it is family and i hope i missed all this turmoil love is the thing that wins it usually does in the end yes but in the short term there is like we were talking about there's a bit of bickering but at least no no more duels no more duels you mentioned dolly parton that's a segue that's this listen i'm not very good at this thing i'm trying to figure out okay that we both love dolly parton i mean so you're you're big into live music so maybe you can measure why you love dolly parton i definitely would love to talk i would love to interview her she's such an icon she's such an incredible human what i love about her and i've really come to love her in recent years is she's so authentically herself and she's obviously so talented and and so accomplished and this extraordinary woman but i just feel like she has no conflict within herself as to who she is she reminds me a lot of my mom in that way and and it's super refreshing and and really beautiful to observe somebody somebody who's so in the public eye being so fully secure in in who they are what their talent is and and what drives them so i think she's she's amazing and she leads with a lot of like love and positivity so i think she's very cool i hope you have a long conversation with her she's like okay so there's many things to say about her first like incredibly great musician songwriters performer yeah also can create an image and have fun with it you know like have fun being herself like over the top it feels that way right like she's really she enjoys after all these years it feels like she's enjoying she like enjoys what she does and you also have the sense that if she didn't she wouldn't do it that's right and just an iconic country musician country music singer yeah there's a lot we've talked about a lot of musicians who do you enjoy you mentioned adele seeing her perform hanging out with her yeah i mean she's extraordinary her voice is unreal so she is i find her to be so talented and she's so unique in that three year olds love her music she was actually the first concert arabella ever went to at madison square garden when she when she was around four and ninety year olds love her music and that's pretty rare to have that kind of bandwidth of resonance so so i think she's so talented we actually just saw her i took all three kids in las vegas around a month ago alice johnson whose case i had worked with in the white house my father commuted her sentence her her case was brought to me by a friend kim kardashian and and she came to the show we all went together with some mutual friends and that was like a very profound it was amazing to see adele but it was a very profound experience for me to have with my kids because she rode with us in in a car on the way to the show and and she talked to my kids about her experience and her story and how her case found its way to me and i think for young children it's very abstract you know policy and so for her to be able to share with them this was a very beautiful moment and led to a lot of really incredible conversations with each of my kids about our time in service because you know they gave up a lot for for me to do it actually alice told them the most beautiful story about the plays she used to put on in prison how these shows were like the hottest ticket in town like you could not get into them they always extended their run and but for the people who were in them a lot of those men and women had never experienced applause nobody had ever shown up at their games or at their plays or and and clapped for them and the emotional experience of of just being able to give someone that you know being able to stand and and and applaud for someone and how meaningful that was and she was showing us pictures from these different productions and it was a really it was a beautiful moment alice actually after her sentence was commuted and and she came out of prison together we worked on twenty three different pardons or commutations so so the impact of of her experience and how she was able to to take her her opportunity and and create that same opportunity for others who who were deserving and and who she believed in was was very beautiful so anyway that was an extraordinary concert experience for my kids to be able to have that moment oh what a story so just that's the sort of the because here we are dancing at adele yeah exactly exactly it's like that turning point later was almost to the day six years later so that that policy that meeting meaning of the minds resulted in a major turning point in her life and alice's life and now even dancing with adele and now we're at adele yeah i mean you mentioned also other i've seen commutations where it's it's a and it's an opportunity to step in and consider the ways that the justice system does not always work well like in cases when it's nonviolent crime and drug offenses there's there's a case of a person you mentioned that received a life sentence for selling weed yeah yeah it you know and it's just the number it's like hundreds of thousands of people are in the federal prison jail in the system for drug for selling drugs that's the only thing with no no violence on their record whatsoever and it's obviously there's a lot of complexity there's the details matter but oftentimes the justice system does not do right in the way we think right is and it's nice to be able to step in and help people like and direct they're overlooked and they have no advocate jared and i helped in a small way on his effort but he really spearheaded the effort on on criminal justice reform through the first step act which was an enormously consequential piece of legislation that gave so many people another opportunity and that was amazing so working with him closely on that was a beautiful thing for us to also experience together but in the final days of the administration you're not getting legislation passed and anything you do administratively is going to be probably overturned by an incoming administration you know how do you use that time for maximum results and i really like dug in on on pardons and commutations that i thought were were were overdue and and were worthy and and my last night in washington dc the gentleman you mentioned corvin i was on the phone with his mother at twelve thirty in the morning telling her that her son would be getting out the next day you know so and it felt really it's it's one person but you see with alice like the ripple effect of you know the commutation granted to her and her ability and the impact she'll have within her family with her grandkids and now she's an advocate for so many others who are voiceless you you know it felt like it felt like the perfect way to end four years to be able to to be able to call those parents and call those kids in some cases and and give them the news that a loved one was coming home and oh i just love the cool image of you kim kardashian and alice just dancing on adele show with the kids i love it well kim wasn't at the adele show but but we had got it she had connected us it was beautiful yeah the way the way adele like can hold just like the badassness she has on stage oh yeah like the she does like heartbreak songs like put it in anyone or no it's not even heartbreak like what's what's that genre of song like rolling in the deep like a little anger a little love a little like something a little attitude and just like one of the greatest voices ever all of that together just her by herself yeah i bet you strip it down yeah just strip it the power of her voice you know i think about that one one of the things you're talking about live music one of the amazing things now is you there's so much incredible concert material that's been uploaded to youtube yeah so sometimes i just sit there and watch these like old shows we both love stevie ray vaughan like watching him perform you can even find old videos of like django reinhardt you got me i got you jamie stevie ray vaughan texas flood we had this moment which is hilarious that you said like one of the songs you really like of stevie's is texas flood well my bucket list is to learn how to play it it's a bucket list it's just a bucket list i you made me feel so good because for me texas flood was the first solo and guitar i've ever learned because for me it was the like the impossible solo yeah and then that was so i i worked really hard to to learn it it's like one of the most iconic sort of blues songs texas blues songs and now you made me fall in love with the song again wanna play it out live or at the very least put it up on youtube unless because it is it's so fun to improvise and when you lose yourself in the song it truly is a blues song if you have fun with it i hope you do do that throw on stevie ray vaughan regardless i want you to play it for me hundred percent hundred percent but he's he's amazing and and you know there's so many great performers that are playing live now you know i just saw chris stapleton show he's an amazing country artist he's too good he's that guy is so good lucas nellison is one of my favorite to see live there's so many incredible songwriters and musicians that are out there touring today but i think you also you can go online and watch some of these old performances like django reinhardt was the first because i torture myself was the first song i learned to play on the guitar and it took me like nine months to a year it was i mean i should have chosen a different song but uetu monomor his one of his songs was and it was like finger style and i was just going through and and grinding it out and and that's kinda how i started to learn to play by playing that song but to see these old videos of him playing you know without all his fingers and the skill and the dexterity one of my favorite live performances is actually who really influenced adele is aretha franklin and she did this she did a version of amazing grace have you ever seen this video no i cry look up it was in la it was like the temple missionary baptist church talk about stripped down she's literally i mean just listen to this so or you could do one note and you could just kill it the pain the soulfulness the spirit you feel like in her when you watch this that's true adele carries some of that spirit also right yeah and you can take away all the instruments with adele and just have that voice and it's so commanding and it's so amazing anyway you watch this and you see the arc of also the experience of the people in the choir and them starting to join in and it's anyway it's it's amazing i love watching queen like freddie mercury queen performances yeah like in terms of vocalists and just like great stage presence that live aid performance is like considered one of the best of all i think i've watched that so many times he's so cool can we pull up that for a second go to that part where where he's saying radio ga ga and they're all mimicking his arm it's so cool look at that so good missed that guy so good so that's an example of a person that was born to be on stage so good well we were talking surfing we were talking jujitsu i think live music is one of those kind of rare moments where you can really be present mhmm where something about the anticipation of choosing what show you're going to go to and then waiting for the date to come and normally it happens in the context of community you go with friends and and then allowing yourself to sort of fall into it is is incredible so you've been training jiu jitsu yes trying i mean i've seen you do jiu jitsu you're you're extremely you're you're very like athletic you know you know how to use your body to commit violence maybe there's better ways of phrasing that but anyway it's been a skill that's been honed over time yeah i mean what do you like about jiu jitsu well first of all i love the way i came to it it was my daughter i think i told you this story she's at eleven she told me that she wanted to learn self defense and and she wanted to learn how to protect herself which i just as a mom i was so proud about because at eleven i was not thinking about defending myself you know i i loved that she had sort of that desire and awareness so i i called some friends actually a mutual friend of ours and asked around for for people who i could work with in miami and they recommended the valente brothers studio and you've met all three of them now they're these remarkable human beings and they've been so wonderful for our family i mean first starting with arabella i used to take her and then she'd kinda encourage me and she'd sort of pull me into it and i started doing it with her and then joseph and theo saw us doing it they wanted to start doing it so now they joined and then jared joined so now we're all doing jiu jitsu and right for me there's something really empowering knowing that i have some basic skills to defend myself i think it's something as humans we've kind of gotten away from you look at any other animal and you know even the giraffe they'll use their neck the lion the tiger every species and then there's us you know who most of us don't and i didn't know how to protect myself and i think that it it gives you a sense of confidence and also gives you kind of a sense of calm you know knowing how to deescalate rather than escalate a situation i also think as part of the training you you develop more natural awareness when when you're out and about and i feel like especially you know everyone's you get on an elevator and like the first thing people do is pick up their phone you're walking down the street there people are getting hit by cars because they're walking into traffic i think as you start to get this training you become much more aware of the broader context of what's happening around you which is which is really healthy and good as well but it's been beautiful they actually the valente brothers they have this seven five three code that was developed with some of the samurai principles in mind and all of my kids have memorized it and they'll talk to me about it theo he's eight years old he'll he's able to recite all fifteen so you know benevolence and and fitness and nutrition and flow and awareness and balance and it's an unbelievable thing and they'll actually integrate it into conversations where they'll talk about something that happened yeah rectitude courage benevolence respect honesty honor loyalty so this is not about jiu jitsu techniques or fighting techniques this is about a way of life about the way you interact with the world with other people exercise nutrition rest hygiene positivity that's more on the physical side of things awareness balance and flow it's the mind the body the soul effectively is how they break it out and the kids can only advance and get their stripes if they really internalize this they give examples of each of them and my own kids will come home from school and they'll tell me examples of how things happen that weren't aligned with the seven five three code so it's it's a framework much like religion is in our house and and can be for others it's a framework to discuss things that happen in their life large and small and and has been beautiful so so i do think that like body mind connection is is super strong in in jiu jitsu so there's many things i love about the valente brothers so but one of them is the how rooted it is in philosophy and history of martial arts in general you know a lot of places you'll practice the sport of it maybe the art of it but to recognize the history yeah and what it means to be a martial artist broadly on and off the mat that's really great and the other thing is great is they also don't forget the self defense route the actual fighting routes so it's not just a sport it's a way to defend yourself on the street in all situations and that gives you a confidence in just like you said an awareness about your own body and awareness about others yeah it is you know sadly we forget but there's a so it's a world full of violence or the capacity for violence so it's good to have an awareness of that and a confidence how to essentially avoid it a hundred percent i i've seen it with all of my kids they've and and myself how much they benefited from it but that self defense component and the philosophical elements of you know they pedro will often tell them about like wu wei and sort of soft resistance and and some of these sort of more eastern philosophies that they get exposed to through through their practice there that are sort of non resistance that are beautiful and hard concepts to internalize as an adult but but especially you know when you're twelve ten and and eight respectively so it's it's an it's been an amazing experience for us all i love people like pedro because he he's like finding books that are like in japanese and translating them to try to figure out like the details of a particular history like he's he's like an ultra scholar of martial arts and i love that i love when people give everything every part of themselves to the thing they're practicing yeah you know people have been fighting each other for a very long time and i love from the coliseum on you can't fake anything you can't lie about anything yeah it's it's truly honest you're there and you either win or lose it's simple and that's like it's also humbling that yeah that the reality of that is humbling and oftentimes in life things are not that simple yeah not that black and white so it's nice to have that sometimes that's that's the biggest thing i gained from jiu jitsu is getting my in my ass kicked which is the humbling and it's nice to just get humbled in a very clear way sports in general are great for that i think surfing probably because i can imagine yeah just you know yeah face planting thing not being able to stay on the board it's humbling and the power of the wave is humbling so just like your mom you're an adventurer are there your your bucket list is probably like a hundred and twenty pages is there things like just pop to mind that you're like thinking about especially in the near future just anything well i hope it always is long you know i hope i've never like exhausted exploring all the things i'm curious about i always tell my kids whenever they say you know mom i'm bored only boring people get bored there's too much to learn there's too much to learn so i've got a long one i you know i think obviously there are some like immediate tactical you know interesting things that i'm doing i'm incubating a bunch of businesses i'm investing in a bunch of companies that hopefully i'll always can continue to do that some of the fun things i'm doing in real estate now so those are all on the list of things i'm passionate and excited about you know continuing to explore and learn but in terms of the like the the ones that are more pure sort of adventure or hobby i think i'd like to climb mount kilimanjaro actually i know i would and i the only thing keeping me from doing it in the short term is i feel like it'd be such a great experience to do with my kids and i'd love to have that experience with them i also told arabella we were talking about this archery competition that happens in mongolia and she loves horseback riding so i'm like i feel like that would be an amazing thing to experience together i wanna get barreled by a wave and and learn how to play texas flood i wanna see the northern lights like i wanna go and and experience that i feel like that would be really beautiful i wanna get my black belt like you have nice i asked you how long did it take but so i wanna get my black belt in jujitsu that's like a that's gonna be a longer term goal but with within the next decade yeah a a lot of things you know i'd love to go to space i'd like not just space i think i'm i'd love to go to the moon like step on the moon yeah or float you know in close proximity like that famous photo yeah it's just you in a in a space suit i feel like mars is at this point in my life well the moon's like four days feels more more manageable i don't know but the sunset on mars is blue it's the opposite color i hear it's beautiful might be worth it i don't know you negotiate with you yeah hey you're very welcome goes let me know how it goes i think actually just even going to space where you can look back on earth yeah i think that just to see this little pale blue dot pale blue dot just all of the stuff that ever happened in human civilization is on that and to be able to look at look at it yeah and just be in awe and i think that's the thing that will go away i think being interplanetary my hope is that that heightens for us how rare it is what we have like how precious the earth is i hope that it i hope that it has that effect because i think there's a big component to interplanetary travel that taps into this manifest destiny inclination like the human desire to conquer territory and expand the footprint of civilization that sometimes feels much more rooted in like dominance and conquest than curiosity wonder and and obviously i think there's you know maybe an existential imperative for it at some point or a strategic or and security one but but i hope that what feels inevitable at this moment i mean you know elon musk and what he's doing with spacex and jeff bezos and others it it feels like it's not an if it's a it's a when at this point i hope it also underscores like the need to protect what we have here yeah and it's i hope it's the curiosity that drives that exploration and i hope yeah the exploration will give us a deeper appreciation of the thing we have back home and that earth will always be home and it's a home that we protect and celebrate what gives you hope about the future of this thing we have going on human civilization the whole thing i think i feel a lot of hope when i'm in nature i feel a lot of hope when i am experiencing people who are good and honest and pure and true and passionate and that's not an uncommon experience so those experiences give me hope yeah other humans we're pretty cool i love humanity we're awesome you know not always but but we're a pretty good species yeah for the most part on the whole we we do alright yeah we do alright we we create some beautiful stuff and i hope we keep creating and i hope you keep creating you have already done a lot of amazing things build a lot of amazing things and i hope you keep building and creating and doing a lot of beautiful things in this world ivanka thank you so much for talking today thank you lex thanks for listening to this
