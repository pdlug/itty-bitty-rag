lex this is the lex treatment podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's matthew cox what was the first crime you committed the first mortgage i ever did a mortgage is me borrowing money from a bank to buy a house yeah how can you find a way to commit crime in this how can you do fraud in this space it's it's very difficult for the average guy to commit fraud because there's so many safeguards set up you know if you were to go in and say i make three hundred thousand dollars a year okay well we want your w twos we want your pay stubs we're gonna call your employer we're gonna check to make sure your employer how long they've been incorporated we're gonna check to make sure they're registered we're gonna it's like your whole plan fell apart you know because the average guy can't do that he can't even come up with a with a pay stub and w2 so the average person you know or i'm gonna put down this much money but you're gonna borrow that money from the seller you know okay well then they start asking for bank statements where does the money come from how long has it been in your bank like you can't even have it put in your bank for a day get a letter you know it's kind of been there for ninety days or sixty days depending on the bank and and so there's all these ways for the average person it's very difficult to commit fraud the average guy that works at walmart and makes sixty thousand dollars a year and he's been there for five years and he saved his deposit like it's very that's really the guy that those transactions are set up for to borrow a mortgage from bank of america that's the guy they're looking for so to commit fraud in this space you have to misrepresent some aspect of your identity of how much you're worth how much money you have this kind of stuff right you have to be able to lie to the bank anytime you lie to the bank you've committed fraud and it's funny when i was you know doing it i would say ah it's it's in the gray area there's no gray area where you're either lying in some capacity or you're not so it's it for instance the very first loan i did i whited out my borrower had been thirty days late on her on a rent so they're really looking at the last two years so when when you go into the bank and that most of what they're asking is it is a two year window they're saying how long have you been on their job they care about two years and how long have you been at your at your residency they're looking for two years now you could be at three places in two years that's fine as long as you consistent consistently paid for two years which she had been in an apartment complex but she'd been thirty days late and she caught it up but she was late bank and the bank doesn't want to lend you money if if you've been thirty days late so i was a broker and i whited out the thirty day late i just got rid of it and my manager is the person that told me to do it she said it'll be fine and she was right it was what did it feel like so that was the first fraudulent action you committed yeah i mean i you know i was i was worried you know i was say you know i sweated bullets for four or five days you know but i mean i i was concerned and i don't know that i was concerned that i had broken the law i was concerned because i was behind on my on my truck payment i was behind on my mortgage like i had banked on being a mortgage broker and i'd gone deep deep behind on all my bills to do this so in the last minute when this loan isn't going to close and i have to commit fraud to make that happen and that the idea of my fear was they were going to figure it out and maybe i'd get fired you know i didn't think i was going to go to jail because my manager assured me you're not going to jail like they'll be you'll get fired at best so my concern was they were gonna catch it and i get fired and i wouldn't get paid like i needed that money so bad so maybe paint the picture here where were you working who was the manager the manager was it's funny because i i i don't think i ever really mentioned this it her name was gretchen zayas she eventually i don't mind saying it she eventually got ended up going to jail for fraud or her name was gretchen zayas and and she was a manager i was working for a company called eagle lending and it was in tampa and i this was like my first month so it was my very first deal three or four weeks into it into that first month and i walk in i put the file in front of my manager she looks through everything you know oh great good good and put this one piece of paper over here and sat there and then when she was done i said what's what's going on she goes perfect file's perfect she goes but your borrower's thirty day late on her rent and she said that that's it's done she's like that's a deal killer and i was like oh my gosh you know what do i do and i remember she pulled out a what thing of whiteout remember the whiteout not the sticks but it went yeah and she started going and i was like what she was if i was you and she handed she's i'd white it out make a copy stick it back in the file yeah she said it'll be fine and i went i could i was like that that's fraud i could go to jail and she goes and she was like it's they're never gonna catch it she said look i we do stuff i do stuff all the time she said they're not gonna catch it and nobody's calling the fbi she was worst case that that worst case scenario if underwriting catches it then they'll fire you that's it nobody's calling you're not going to jail and i was you know i trusted her i was like okay and so i i did what she said i stuck it in the file and i mean like i said for four or five days i was like oh my god so scared how do you at this point probably twenty nine i think it was twenty nine yeah you know like i had gone to college and so many things had not worked out you know i got a degree in fine arts it's not it's not a there's not a lot of people looking for anyone with a fine arts degree and you know i tried my i tried to be tried to be a an insurance adjuster tried that for about a year year and a half that didn't work out ended up ended up working construction for a few years and you know so finally the girl i was dating said you gotta be a mortgage broker you know she's just had just started as a mortgage in the mortgage industry and she was like you have to do this like you were born to do this this is perfect for you what does she see in you she said it's just you're a salesman and i was like because i was like you know i barely balanced my checkbook like i don't know i don't know anything about numbers and she's like it has nothing to do with that it's sales it's putting together deals you know you're good at that you're good at negotiating you're you know you're a natural sales salesman and i figured i'd i need to try something so what aspect of mortgages is sales and deal making and what aspects require the charisma that you clearly have well one you've got you have clients that have lots of options perfect credit i ended up working for a company that was a subprime lender and those people didn't have a lot of options by some honestly by the time they got to that to eagle lending that their options were over so what ended up ends up happening is you're negotiating with sellers you know you would think that a lot of the stuff that in that industry that real estate agents should do you know the brokers end up doing because real estate agents are are used to you meet them at the house or they take you to several houses they you know they they open the door they walk around they write up a contract that's legit a legit contract and you already you're already pre approved everything works out but subprime that's not the case you got borrowers with horrific job history they don't have enough of the down payment they can't maybe they have the down payment but they don't have the closing costs so you have to go to the real estate agent and say listen i need you to raise the purchase price and have the the seller pay the closing costs which is legal but that's not to a degree but that's not how they wrote the contract so now you're having to get them to rewrite the contract or you're have your you know there's little things you're trying to do and the more the more deals you get done and the more you deal with certain real estate agents the more you start to realize that they're you know you know which ones are completely above board and which ones are willing to twist the rules and a lot of it works on personal relationships right right for some reason people tend to like me mhmm and trust me yeah i don't know why it's it's it hasn't worked out for so many people but people naturally seem to trust me and so if i say hey i can close the loan but you gotta do this it'll be cool don't worry we do it all the time it's like my third loan and you know i've been doing this for years and they go oh okay and then they raise the purchase price they add some money they have the seller of the house give the borrower some money they stick it in the bank or they put it in the in escrow at the closing company like now you're starting to massage deals what was the second time you committed a crime so what how did it start to evolve from the whiteout well i mean when that went through you know i i think a normal person probably would have said wow that was a one time thing got away with it i'm good but for me it just emboldened me like i just got a check for like i i don't know what it was dollars twenty five dollars three thousand five hundred i was thrilled and by that time i was already working on another deal but that guy he made i forget something like he'd made like let's say forty five thousand dollars the year before in his w2 if you based on his based on his current track record or his year to date of his pay stub he made an just enough money but if you factored in last year's w2 he was shy so if i change that forty five thousand to fifty one thousand then he could the loan closes i get a check for three thousand five hundred bucks he gets into a house doing him a favor you know i'm doing god's work so i fix it it i kick back i'm terrified a little bit you know worried about it sure enough it closes four or five days later they call me he's ready to close a week later we close i get a check next guy that comes in i mean i i got very very quickly i was concerned do you have a house do you have a deal is it ready i can get you i can get you done now if you were in bankruptcy or something there's some things you just say you'd pull their credit and you just couldn't help them if they were if they had a five fifty credit score or something and no job i mean you know it had to be within reason but very quickly it was changing w twos changing pay stubs changing appraisals you know fixing verify like i said verifications of rent so it evolved very quickly for me and you're essentially helping people that's what i told myself giving him a chance people that have been really struggling financially in life so you've been telling yourself that this is you're doing good good thing for people i told myself that right up until that those loans were solid and i was helping those people out right up until i went to prison and i was in prison and i had to write the government asked me to write an ethics and fraud course for to help teach the nation's mortgage brokers you know all loan officers and brokers have to take i think it's nine hours of continuing education every single year and i was approached to write the ethics course and it was about that time and about the same period of time i was writing writing a book my book and that kind of i started reflecting on what i had done you know and the truth is like and this is a horrible thing to say cause the first time i ever heard somebody say this i remember thinking oh that's a horrible thing to say some people should not own a house they shouldn't be allowed to borrow they're not in a position financially you know and and there were there were many occasions where i put someone in a house that they one hundred percent swore they could afford it was i was helping them i told myself i was helping them and a year and a half later they're going into foreclosure their stuff's on the corner they don't know where to go and the truth is is that i'm not smarter than the actuaries that came up with those underwriting guidelines so in this whole process how are you making money are you taking a percentage broker yeah i charge a broker fee or you charge yield spread so yield spread is let's say the interest rate is eight percent interest if i charge them twenty five basis points over the eight percent so i charge them eight and a quarter you know eight point two five then i get one percent of the loan back as a fee so if i charge them eight and a half percent i get two points back so if it's a hundred thousand dollar piece of property and the bank says your interest rate is gonna be eight percent and i tell you eight point five and i'm charging you a three thousand five hundred dollars broker fee now i'm making five thousand five hundred dollars so on even a hundred thousand dollars loan you could make a nice chunk of change i mean it's so how much gray area is here you said that there really isn't when you're lying or not but i mean you're it feels like there is well every time i change something it wasn't gray area i just committed i just committed fraud at this level you're either you either meet the guidelines or someone has massaged it in such a way that they've committed fraud that's it and there's now there's there's tons of ways where you can commit fraud and they just can't figure it out does that make sense like i i mean i've come you've committed fraud and it's like they've looked at the entire they look at all the documents and they double check everything and they know there's fraud in here and they just can't find it but just because they can't find it doesn't mean it's fraud exactly doesn't mean it wasn't fraud as part of this you did a lot of fascinating things one of the things you did you talked about creating synthetic people meaning creating fake identities what does what does it take to do that to do that well so your credit profile is made up of your you know your your at your name date of birth your address and you know your social security number and you know those are the kind of you know and then there's other things where you work that sort of thing but what people don't realize is there's so many people out there that think that the credit bureaus already know who you are right but the truth is the first time the credit bureau has ever heard about you was when you told them the first time you applied for a credit card you they created a credit profile at that moment prior to that they had no idea so the first time you apply you give them your your full name date of birth social security number and your address and they create a credit profile and they say hey no record found of this person he has no credit nothing probably got denied well what i realized through the course of because eventually i ended up leaving that one company and i opened my own mortgage company when i opened that mortgage company i was i was on the inside does that make sense like i wasn't i wasn't just a broker that was sitting out with everybody else and would periodically come in and ask questions or would call underwriting and but really didn't understand what was happening and what exactly what the underwriting guidelines were now i was actually talking to the underwriters and you're you're talking to the to the owners of the lending institutions and the banks and you're talking to all of the account executives and now it wasn't just eagle lending i was talking to there were forty different account executives coming in on a weekly basis trying to get us to sign up with their lender and they're on the inside telling you coming in showing you programs and saying look if your borrower is you know self employed mhmm we don't ask for this or this we just ask for them to say they're self employed like liar loans you've you've heard the term liar loans okay no doc loans where they don't ask for any documentation if he's got over like let's say a seven hundred credit score and he says he's been a plumber and he works for himself then he's got over a seven hundred credit score he just has to say he's worked for himself for over two years and they don't ask any of that they don't ask for any documentation he's got the money in the bank he's got a seven hundred credit score says he's been on the job for two years he's self employed we're going to raise his insure freight by one percent and and he's got you know that's it he's he's got the loan so but you start to you start to know how things work because i hired a bunch of brokers to work underneath me and when they would get caught i would get the phone call so i get the phone call from the owner of a bank or a lending institute you know a lender and that lender says hey matt we got a problem i'm like what's up he's like he's like listen we we caught a fake w two i'm like what do you what do you mean yeah your your broker so and so sent us a file and this person had there's two fake w2s and we're assuming the pay stubs are fake and i'm like are you serious how did you even catch that and they go oh well here's what we did we checked with sunbiz dot com you know sunbiz dot gov which is the secretary of state's website that registers corporations and we checked and the tax id number didn't match and i now i know every w two has to have a matching tax id number for whatever corporation issued it so there's a sequence of checks they do to detect fraud on different documents like w twos right and then you're slowly learning slowly yeah exactly what's the process for detecting i mean i had a pretty good understanding anyway yeah but so i'm starting to learn that so i'm putting these things together and i remember one time i had a woman come in and she came in and she had perfect credit she had like seven fifty credit scores i mean it was perfect and she came in and one of the brokers came in and said hey man he's like can i show you something i was like yeah what's up he he goes look he said i've got this this woman's w twos here i said okay i looked at him and he goes here's your credit report and he goes here's the you know application this is the this is the social security number i went alright and he said this is the social security number on the w two and i went okay keep in mind you go to get a car loan or credit card they never asked for these things so and he was like and i'm really shocked he even noticed it i probably might not have even caught it but he w they were different and i went really and he goes yeah he said so i did you know she just brought them in you know she's here i was like oh bring her in here so she came in sat down i said listen here's what we just found and she was like oh okay you know what i don't want the loan i i just i go no no no no i said listen you're getting the loan you have seven fifty credit score like i don't care what we have to do we're getting you the loan i just wanna know what's going on how are how did you how did you get seven fifty credit scores under this social security number when clearly this is your real social security number you've been working for this company for ten years and your credit profile says it's only like three years old and i was like what happened and what she told me she did was she had been she went through a divorce she had been married for ten years used her husband's i mean his surname for ten years so she has no credit under her maiden name but when they got divorced she switched to her maiden name because when she pulled tried to get anything in her in her husband's surname it was denied bad credit so he had bad credit their credit went bad so he switched to her she switched to her name and a friend told her if she needed to get her electric or anything turned on she could use her name and use her daughter's or son's social security number which was like a four year old kid yep so she used that and it went through she had to put a deposit down but it went through at least wasn't denied so that went through then she went and she applied for an apartment with that sure enough it went through she had no credit but they said you don't have bad credit so she said once she moved into the apartment she then started getting these pre approved credit cards so she she goes but i knew i had applied there using my son's social security number let's say so she started filling those out and sure enough she got a credit card and then she got two and then she got a preapproval from ford motor credit she went and got herself a new car got approved she'd been making the payments ever since just seven fifty credit scores she thought she'd try her hand at buying a house in his name and his social security number and we caught it and she got a house in that name we closed it i just was like wow like this is great can i ask you a question about that because it seems like she's able to pay for everything right so while this is highly illegal is it unethical is it like it's it's unethical in that it's messing with the system on which a lot of people rely but it feels like there's some aspect of the system that's broken in that it doesn't give people like her a second chance she could have claimed bankruptcy and then two years later listen two years out of bankruptcy you can go into bank of america and get a conventional mortgage assuming you have perfect credit outside the bankruptcy you have the down payment you make enough money there's a whole bunch of you know a bunch of underwriting guidelines you have to meet but that's possible but you're right for instance she wasn't getting an apartment using with her bad credit she wasn't getting her utilities turned on she wasn't getting any of those things done so getting your life back on track is just harder it's extremely hard so there's a temptation to take the shortcut and the shortcut is often going to be illegal right and she stumbled into it but she basically explained it to me and i i mean i don't think she had walked out of the of my brokerage office before i went and i just started making up names and i think i went i went into our file cabinet and grabbed some people's ten forties which we had you know their tax returns and looked up children's social security numbers and just grabbed some random kids social security numbers and their name and went and pulled them and sh and you know but i changed their date of birth to be an adult pulled it and sure enough it came up no file found you know it didn't say fraud alert or fraud or anything they didn't say mismatch this mismatch that didn't say anything it just said you know no file found well then we went and we pulled apply for a couple of credit cards using a child's social security number and then we went and pulled our own credit report and sure enough it didn't say no no file found it just said that there had been two inquiries applying for credit cards so i was like oh wow like that's a credit profile so that turns into me going to social security and calling or calling social security and trying to get them to issue me social security numbers to adults that had never had a social security number issued to them i need to get social security number to give me a clean social security number but i called up and of course you know i'm a novice i don't really know what i'm doing so i'm i call up and i say hey yeah i was i'm never had a social security number issue and they were like how old are you and i was like thirty one years old you know and they were yeah that's not possible do you have a driver's license yeah do you have a bank account yeah you have a social security number bring your driver's license in and we'll we'll pull it up okay well that's not gonna happen hang up call back hi my son is seven years old or three years old and he he had never had a social security number issued oh okay was he born in a hospital yes well he has one he has one go ahead and get your son come in here no i'm not doing that hang up call back so i called back probably ten times and eventually someone said i kept altering it kept altering what i was saying till i got to the point where i was saying my son was born with a midwife not in the hospital and the pediatrician told us that we needed to go we need to get social security to issue a social security number and they would say well he should have issued it but that does happen sometimes so bring your son in and we'll you know you fill out paperwork we'll have one issued know first we'll check to see he never had one issued and if he hasn't we'll issue one and so then it turned into my son is out of the country and i need this and then that turned into oh i'm sorry well how old is he i was like you know he's three and they go well i'm sorry if he's over the age of twelve months old he has to come in hang up the phone call back my son is ten months old he's out of the country born with a midwife never had a social security number and then they go oh okay that's fine just get his birth certificate and a shot his shot record and you can come in fill out the paperwork we'll get issue you a social security number and that's what i did so i figured out how to create a birth certificate you know i ordered the security paper you know when where you make a copy it says you know void if copied so i ordered had to order a bunch of that and i went online and figured out how to make a fake birth certificate it was great too cause like the county actually they give you a blank form and then they actually show you what it looks like filled out like a handwritten one filled out so i knew if he was born this day he got these shots two months later he got these shots six months later he got these shots so i just filled it out i even had to order a a seal so you have to have a seal that says like hillsborough county vital statistics or richland county vital statistics or something and i couldn't get anybody to make that so i changed it to like richland county office of virtual records and then i took like two twenty grit sandpaper and and and hit it over and over and over again to wear it down and then i stay you know i did the embossment on the on the corner and you know i printed it on the security paper embossed it nobody looks at those things you could see richland county you know you could you could kind of see that in that really they just grab it and they go like this this is what you realize after you when i started getting started getting driver's licenses issued by by the state dmv right the state i figured out eventually it was easier to just go into the dmv and have them give me a driver's license than actually make one so but you notice they would just grab the thing they'd fill the form and go okay like they don't even look at it so which is upsetting if you put as much work into these documents as i am for them to go okay yeah that's good sit over there i felt like going like hey bro like take a look at this this is artwork yeah but they're looking for the low hanging fruit of crappy fraud right yeah this stuff was right through so okay so so birth certificate gets you a social security number so it's it's it's interesting because you've also you you've done a lot of different approaches to creating synthetic people there's homeless people involved so sometimes it's grounded in real people or real names and then you're right like some part is fake some part is real sometimes and sometimes it's completely all fake right because now i have the name i have the social security numbering what's great is they mail you what's even better is you get then you get to pick whatever name you want mhmm you know because when you pick your child's name he doesn't even have to have your last name mhmm you pick any name so i would pick a name and i just say oh my wife's last name is this if it could they questioned it which they never did but you know i've got a social security number and then i would go apply for credit cards and i get denied of course but they would all offer me a secured credit card so i i then fill out the secured credit card and i send them send the bank the money and they would give me a secured credit card for five hundred dollars three hundred dollars a thousand whatever it was and then once you start making the payments i pulled the credit and a credit profile shows up saying that this thirty one year old man with the social security number that i know was issued you know a couple months ago has three three credit cards they don't even say secure they just say there's like this credit card is five hundred dollars it was issued by bank of america this one was issued by capital one this one was so i've got three of them but i had no credit scores so at that point i kind of kicked back and waited and i just kept making payments and i remember thinking to myself i'll bet you they know that the credit bureaus don't generate credit scores for at least a year and i was like god this is going to be a year long process and while that was happening i started other i was starting other ones cause i figured at least in a year i'll have a bunch of these secure you know these we call them like phantom borrowers but now they call them synthetic identities so at least i would have these synthetic identities and maybe i could do something with them but what happened was at six months i went and i randomly pulled the guy's credit you know the person's credit and seven zero five credit scores seven zero five seven zero one six ninety five i was like oh my god you only needed a six twenty to borrow to get a ninety five percent loan from the bank so i was like oh my god this is in this is amazing sure enough a month later the other ones i had started all of them bam bam bam so what do you do with the phantom power like what how do you make money on this so i think most people if you were just like a scammer or a fraudster you would you would probably just get credit cards and maybe build up that history or maybe try and borrow a personal loan which is limited you know it's personal loans are used to be you used to be you could go to an fdic insured bank which borrows money those you know the personal loans they lend out at the max of fifteen thousand dollars you know so you could do that so you can go through this whole process of creating a fake identity getting a card paying it off building up credit and then you get fifteen thousand dollars at the end or so you get fifteen maybe you know if you wanna keep making the payments you know if you could wait a year you could probably get fifteen thousand maybe you could maybe get twenty thirty thousand and a bunch of little smaller ones you know get seven thousand five hundred cause i did i know that there was a seven thousand five hundred dollars from citibank you know dollars five thousand five hundred from american general so you maybe get what twenty five thousand you know maybe thirty thousand in personal loans maybe you can you could you could then apply for you can maybe get another twenty or thirty thousand in regular credit cards you know ten thousand here eight thousand five thousand and then you go to the lower department store cards and you go to home depot you get a thousand you get five hundred so it ends up being maybe you can get fifty sixty thousand maybe if you really good you could get up to eighty or a hundred thousand dollars in credit cards and personal loans if you really knew what you were doing but per person per identity per identity but i had the ability to to leverage that perfect those perfect credit profiles against properties and i mean ultimately that's what i end up doing and and so each one of those identities was worth you know a few million can you explain how that works so to leverage them against property so how does that work with the mortgage so what i did eventually i mean this was like is down the road but you know i mean at this point when things are just my whole life had kind of gone off the rails i was on federal probation and so what i did decided what i was going to do was start running a scam a much larger scam and what i was going to do was i was going to start flipping properties right like buy houses cheap fix them up and sell them there's an area of tampa called ybor city so i was going to start flipping houses anywhere city and you know i thought okay i can i can buy these houses for you could buy a really crappy house at that time for fifty dollars sixty thousand let's say fifty and then you could put twenty five thousand dollars into it in renovations you could renovate it for twenty five and maybe you could get an appraisal for a hundred so i thought what i could do is i can i can buy these houses renovate them and sell them to you know regular people but i also had been working on the synthetic identities and then i thought well or i could just sell them to synthetic identities and and then i wouldn't have to dump twenty five thousand into it right and these guys are perfect they have perfect credit i can provide w2s and pay stubs because by this point manufacturing businesses so i've got i've got i've incorporated businesses i've got websites for the businesses w twos pay stubs so these guys have these guys look perfect so i figure i'll buy these properties for fifty thousand sell it to these guys for a hundred maybe i'll pocket forty or fifty thousand i don't really have to do anything but that seems shortsighted so i thought would be even better is that if i did a little bit of renovations and then i sold it for much higher maybe i put ten thousand clean up the outside of it cause these guys don't care what the inside of of the property looks like you know they they're not they don't exist so and then i but i can't how am i gonna get an appraisal for a hundred thousand dollars well do you know how appraisals work okay so the bank sends it an appraiser out or at that time you could provide an appraisal they can review it so they'll do what's called a desktop review they review it they review it on on the computer and they never go out to the property or they send someone out they they call that you know it's like a field review they send someone out and they just look at the house they don't go in it though so i have to clean out the clean up the outside of the house so what i did was but the problem is is if your house is you're trying to sell that house for let's say two hundred thousand the other houses they have to pick three comparable sales in the area that are also going to support a two hundred thousand dollars sales price well there's no other house is selling for two hundred thousand near this house so i thought if i want to get these things appraised for two hundred two hundred and fifty thousand i have to have comparable sales and that appraisal is going to be reviewed so what i did was i started i went out and i bought this house for fifty thousand and i recorded the sale at two hundred thousand so when you buy a house for a hundred thousand dollars you pay seven hundred dollars in dock stamps but if you pay the extra an extra seven hundred bucks the sale shows up for two hundred thousand well i'm buying these things for fifty so i'm paying three hundred fifty dollars and i'm just paying an extra one thousand fifty dollars so so it ends up being you know fourteen hundred dollars but the but the sale shows up at two hundred thousand on a house that's a a crack house i bought for fifty thousand dollars now i go i trim the trees we mow the yard we clean up the porch we put the porch rail on maybe we paint it real nice we black out all the windows you can't see inside but from the sh from the curb it looks great and i get an appraisal so i do that with that house i do that with another house all within a mile so i buy four houses knowing i could use the all there's a subject and three comparables for all of them so the first thing i did is i bought four houses for fifty thousand sixty thousand forty thousand and i recorded the values at you know two ten two hundred one ninety so i get an appraiser to come out there he appraises it he said of course he says it's horrible but there's comparables here now of course it is in bad shape and he says it's in bad shape but i i go ahead and i correct all that so i correct it so now if you if you review the appraisal and you're in california or even if you drive your car down your the appraiser comes to the house and looks at it from the street it looks fine but the truth is i've got sixty thousand dollars into this property and you're appraising it for two hundred thousand so the bank's ready to not they're not going to lend two hundred but they'll lend one ninety so the bank is ready to lend this synthetic borrower dollars one hundred and ninety thousand on a house that i have sixty thousand in so i walk so i schedule a closing and we close on the house and i walk away with sixty thousand dollars you know and and the thing is like the problem was is by the time i got to this point i knew so many people in the industry i nobody had to really at that point show up although i've had people show up for the synthetic identities and signed for them almost all the closings nobody ever showed up i just showed up and said to the title to the title agency and said hey my borrower he's at at work right now he can't make it can i just take the file and i'll have him sign all the documents at his work and i'll bring them back he's like an hour and a half away from here i'll be back in two or three hours and they're like oh wow man matt thank you so much and they would give it to me and i'd go sit in the parking lot and i'd sign all the documents i'd wait an hour or two and i'd come back in and say here you go how are we able to keep all of this in your mind because you have to not slip up in any of these conversations it's pretty easy for me to for me to keep them everything in the correct category does that make sense like it's it's i'm not great at a lot of things but this i was very good at but well there's these phantom people that exist and they were becoming real people in your mind as in like you're able to tell good stories with with those people right like because if you're talking to the appraiser if you're talking to the everybody in involved well keep in mind the appraiser almost never meets the borrower never not even like ninety nine point ninety nine ninety nine percent of the time they never meet them but you have to talk about them yeah so i guess what i'm asking is you're able to converse fluently about these synthetic identities yeah they they all had different jobs they all had the all the jobs were basically they were all on the job for five years they were all i was a lot of it was there's a template yeah exactly but yeah you got it yeah it listened all matter of fact almost every one of them had the same birth date you know so because i you know who knows there's so it it yeah it wasn't difficult and keep in mind the a lot of the the brokers barely ever meet meet the bar they call in on the phone but it didn't matter anyway because i'm walking in saying i got a slam dunk deal for you mhmm and they're like oh wow man you got the w twos the pay stubs you've got all the you got all their their rental history you have everything done it's perfect thank you so much they're happy to do it hey i print up the docs and i'll have them go sign it great wow thank you you know assuming they didn't already know about it and almost everybody involved in this by the time i was done was involved there was probably fifteen or twenty people that all knew what was going on the full of it they knew the full depth of it yes yeah yeah maybe not one hundred percent everything but they definitely knew this is fraud and they were still going along with it yeah yeah keep in mind that even when i give you an example one of my you know let's say and this happened with almost all of them was he would buy five houses so the guy bought what happens to the basic design was i buy the houses i record the values higher and this person buys all five houses refinances them he ends up borrowing a little bit over a million dollars in his name then of course then i go and i i get personal loans from several banks i get credit cards i run up all of his credit cards by this point i've got ten dollars twenty thousand worth of credit cards in the guy's name so the guys are all worth like a million million and change well once i stopped paying you start getting letters from the collection companies right from the banks you know and then they sell them off so after about three months you're getting tons of letters and what i would do is i would take my borrower's name i would go online and i would find or i'd go in the newspaper and i would find i would find an article about let's say like a twelve car pileup you know so there's you know the huge accident on i four it's very dangerous so there's a twelve car pileup and someone in the accident was life flighted to tampa general hospital i would cut and paste that article and i would just insert my borrower's name into the article saying that you know brandon green was life flighted to tampa general hospital is currently in critical condition i would then print that article out on newsprint i then make a copy of the cut it up make a copy of the newsprint highlight his name and i would write a letter from brandon green's fictional sister to the collection companies saying several months ago my brother was in a horrible car accident he is currently they've got the article they have the highlighted name he clearly was in in this in this accident he is currently in a coma and the doctors say even if he wakes up from the coma he will never work again that you know so you might as well just foreclose on stop writing us letters and take the houses back and that's all they're looking for is is is a reason at this point that even if they look into brandon green they can't figure out if he's a real person or not because he's got a social security number he's got and everything went bad at the same time he's got multiple rental properties or his primary residence all of his credit cards went bad everything went bad we have an excuse we have a letter that happens people get divorced they lose their job they get an accident it's reasonable when they look into it all looks legitimate even if they ordered another appraisal by this point it's not four comparable sales or three or four comparable sales by this point it's like ten fifteen twenty thirty forty fifty because i kept making more and more of these guys what was your just almost like a tangent what's your thinking process there's a lot of cleverness going on here so like the the car pile up as a solution newspaper you mail it are you sitting there alone and thinking through this like how do you come up with that idea is it it's a very interesting a very clever innovative idea so at first i i thought about making like a a fake death certificate he died you know but i thought oh i don't know like what if you know like some of these places had like you know you know primary mortgage insurance like what if the primary mortgage insurance like what if they try and claim because he was dead or like i don't know i don't know that side so i'm like ugh i don't wanna do that i want to do something that's semi verifiable and third parties like a third party telling you this is what happened i thought well like the newspaper you know and you know or do i claim bankruptcy and i've done that i've gone and got the bankruptcy forms right you can go to the bankruptcy court and they'll give you forms to mail to all of your creditors and you mail them they stop contacting you they wait to be located by or notified by the bankruptcy court but my fear there is you know nobody's ever gonna notify them like i'm not going through bankruptcy for one of these guys so it was like this is a this is a better bet than just writing a letter saying i'm going through a divorce my wife's keeping those houses that's her problem you know you could do there's lots of things you could do but to me this was yeah they're not gonna try and how do you how do you shut it down without him dying how do you shut that down this is how you shut it down he's in a coma he'll never work again he was in a car accident here's the proof he can't even write you i'm his sister i wrote you the letter it's a one time letter that seems to type all type exactly exactly you know i get owner the exact exactly how that you know what sparked that as much as there were so many other avenues that i could have gone that i was i just didn't know but you were thinking through all those different avenues yeah are you mostly thinking alone i mean you know i had guys that i was bouncing ideas the ideas off of there were other guys that were involved in the scam you know everybody think that scam ended up making like the fbi said i think it was like eleven and a half million or something and and you know but but there were so many other people that were involved in that scam that were you know this guy's getting fifty this guy's getting twenty you know seventeen thousand twenty thousand we're just doing it constantly and so the bank would foreclose on that property they'd take it back they put it back on the mls they put it back on the mls for a hundred for two hundred thousand it wouldn't sell then they drop it to you know one fifty wouldn't sell then they drop it to one twenty five one thirty wouldn't sell i drop it to ninety and somebody buy it for like ninety it wasn't worth ninety but by that point that whole area had should we done so many houses at that point the whole area shot up and the the fbi said we did one hundred and nine houses i don't think that's true but we we when i ended up leaving tampa after that scam falls apart and the fbi shows up forbes came out with an article whatever six months later and they said that the ybor city zip code was one of the top twenty fastest growing appraising areas in the country and you know everybody was like oh that's mad cause this place is a dump like this is a horrible place like this is and i remember one time i had talked to a guy you know years later and he was like oh all the comparable sales have dried up like when you left there was just nothing even close to two hundred thousand you mentioned right before telling the story of this elaborate scam that you were on federal probation how did that happen so i mentioned that i i own the mortgage company yes right so i i had started a mortgage company i had maybe a dozen guys working for me and and there was fraud you know like i would say it wasn't all fraud but whatever sixty seventy percent of it was fraud that was going in there and from the outside of that that business it looked very legit and you know we were an fha approved lender we were a va approved lender we did conventional probably signed up with forty or fifty subprime lenders but but there was a considerable amount of fraud and you know it it kept getting you know it it became a game right you know it you start you start i started getting just more and more creative like like i i said every time i would get away with something like you become emboldened by it it's like nice you know like hey the underwriter's looking for this and looking for this and you sit there and go man so that she's you know that's what am i gonna do what am i you know what we could do we could create create our own bank what yeah here's what we're gonna do we're gonna go on like how do they know if this bank exists the these people are in california they're in new york like they don't know so what we're gonna do is we're going to go online and keep on this is two thousand you know this is two thousand two thousand and one like this is the internet's in its infancy still right so we figure out i remember godaddy i think had just come up with a site where you could build your own website like how cool is that so i go online with a buddy of mine and we create something called the bank of ybor you know we cut and pasted things that we like from other banks and we got a one eight hundred number you could call or a one eight six number whatever it was and you could call it and it would go to a voicemail and so we set up this bank and then i ended up making bank statements which by this point i already had been making bank statements to to prove someone has their down payment because a lot of times people they have good enough credit to borrow ninety five percent or ninety percent but they don't have their down payment so we'd raise the purchase price high enough to cover their five or ten percent down payment and we would bring their down payment for them or we'd have the owner of the house bring the down payment for them and then we would have a check cut out of the closing statement to a construction company that i owned and we get our money back so they get into the house for a hundred percent financing or one hundred and ten percent some of them turned into one thirty we want to pay off their car give them an incentive to sign they don't have still have the money to buy it so we're doing all kinds of insane things well at some point remember gretchen zayas my my old manager yeah the original yes she came and worked for me for a short period of time and then she and her husband went and opened their own mortgage company which you should have known it was gonna be fraudulent from the get go because it was called creative financing it was with yeah create cfm creative finance no creative creative was in the name yeah yeah creative was in the name oh boy so it's really on the nose so she she's doing very well and and we became very close by the way where we go on vacation went to puerto rico together i'm i got married at the time i got i was married our kids you know play together we babysit we go to each other's parties we're close we're good friends and she's got her own mortgage company she calls me up periodically and asks me hey can you make a w two or hey can you make me a pay stub sure no problem we're friends that's what fraudulent friends do so you know if i needed somebody to to verify rent or verify somebody's rental history or employment she had cell phones she would answer that sort of thing for me well when it ended up happening is she gets in trouble she starts doing fraudulent loans for some guys you know and these guys are doing what's called a cash back scam so they're they're getting like a half a million dollar loan on a house that's worth three hundred thousand dollars so they're getting they're buying the house for whatever six hundred thousand it's really only worth three hundred three fifty but she happened to be in an area where she could get it the appraisal jacked up so they they buy the house they get two dollars three hundred thousand back and it's it's a it's a straw man scam right it's a cashback straw man scam so this is a real person that's buying the house he's got perfect credit but he's willing he's willing to let to ruin his credit to get a couple hundred thousand in his pocket so he never has any intentions so it's not a synthetic identity it's not a stolen identity it's a straw man he's a fake kind of a not a fake person but he's just a straw man he's a stand in so he stands in he signs the paperwork he buys buys the house they end up getting two dollars three hundred thousand well this guy buys like five houses so it's a cut two dollars three million they've lost five six hundred six dollars seven hundred thousand and these guys never even make the first payment they they just let them go into foreclosure so the bank immediately investigates and realizes this is fraud so the fbi comes in they grab pete and gretchen she has to hire an attorney of course and she doesn't get thrown in jail or anything they just come to their office and they they tell them they're investigating them they know what's going on and they they want to talk to they're like well look we want to talk to you and you're going to be indicted okay so she comes to me well actually pete came to me and said look man can you refinance our house and get a seventy five thousand out to pay our attorney i said no problem gretchen gives me w twos pay stubs fake the whole thing's fake i get her i refinance i get a second mortgage on our house dollars seventy five thousand they pay their attorney their attorney immediately says you need to wear a wire on this guy like he just got you seventy five thousand dollars you know i don't know how you got seventy five thousand dollars the attorney knows something's wrong cause the attorney's like they just your whole mortgage company was just shut down there's no way you could borrow seventy five thousand dollars so he is like this this guy's doing fraudulent stuff and she says yes of course he is and he says you need to work with the fbi wear a wire against this guy so she calls me one day and says listen i gotta talk to you the fbi is asking questions about you know and i go what and she goes yeah i was like meet me at a pizza place down the street so you know don't come into my office because everybody knows she's been indicted like everybody in her office quit when the fbi the fbi shows up and gives you a business card and announces they're the fbi everybody quits so i said do not have do not don't don't come here cause they already know they're already concerned so i go and i meet her and pete and we sit down at the at a restaurant you know a little pizzeria and i sit down and she starts telling me that the fbi is asking questions about me and i'm like well what are you talking about like what are they asking and she goes look they came in they took all our files and like i was like i don't know any of this i'm like when did this happen she's like yeah they have a couple of weeks ago and they they and they have some of your files cause i had closed several loans for my wife at the time we were buying rental properties my wife didn't have a job so there there it's all fraud but i couldn't close i could not close those loans in at my mortgage company because i own the property so i'm selling those properties i bought properties renovated them and sold them to my wife to get around something called seasoning seasoning says you have to wait six months to a year to refinance at the market value otherwise you if you want to refinance that's fine but you have to refinance at the price you purchase the property at but i bought these properties for eighty or a hundred thousand renovated them sold them for two three hundred thousand to my my wife who got a very company didn't even get a big mortgage we were just trying to kind of get around a guideline so but my wife was not working and i provided w2s and pay stubs so when she says all this she says yeah they're looking at at your the loans you gave me at at your wife's loans and i went oh my god i said well you didn't tell them that the w twos were fake did you you didn't tell him the pay stubs were fake did you you didn't tell him that the down payments were you didn't tell him that we were married did you i mean just absolutely buried myself and as i'm telling her this i was like okay i i i was like i i i kind of caught myself and i'm okay wait wait wait a minute look okay here's what you're going to tell them you're going to tell them you never met her she called on the phone like i start trying to devise a plan that will answer their questions without getting my wife in trouble or them in trouble and if nobody cooperates the whole thing should shut down you know they it doesn't go anywhere there's no way there's nowhere for them to go if everybody just kind of stonewalls them so as i'm saying all this gretchen says matt we can't lie to the fbi and i go what are you talking about you're already lying to the fbi i mean you you you know you you've been lying to the fbi i mean i just refinanced your house and before i can really say anything pete jumps up her husband stands up and he says we've never lied to the fbi we may not have told them everything but we've never lied and i thought like what what who like who are you talking to like i know that's not true so you're not saying that for my benefit so i was just i kind of look at them and i'm like what and i i remember looking down and and this may mean nothing but both of their cell phones were right next to me mhmm right and i remember they were probably just wearing wires wires but i just remember thinking those cell phones are microphones yeah they probably weren't but i remember thinking oh wow and i just i looked at it and i went wow and i said well i hope you're gonna get something for this and she immediately starts crying and she says mad i'm sorry i have a kid i can't go to jail you have kids at that point yeah i like i have a kid like i have a kid and i was like wow i wow what have you learned about friendship from that like loyalty oh yeah there's no there's that's a that's it's sweet that must have hurt it's cute i mean i i love the idea of it you don't think that no hey i'll tell you why so i go back to my i go back to my office i remember i told her i said tell the fbi agent to call me on the phone do not come in my office so i go back i'm still trying to figure out how to weather this right i go back i sit down phone rings my secretary comes in and says hey agent i'll never forget the guy's name agent scott gale with the fbi and i was like okay is on the phone and she's standing there i was like close the door get out and close it she's like so get on the phone he asked me if i'll come down i said yeah absolutely let's schedule it for next tuesday you know i put it off four or five days i go to my brother-in-law immediately who's who's a a lawyer and he says oh yeah yeah and i don't really tell him exactly what's going on but i tell him this is what's happening kind of and i'm i may be in trouble i need i need a federal defense attorney i don't even know what a federal defense i don't even know the difference but he said you need a federal defense attorney he's the fbi so he we go on a couple we meet a couple of lawyers i ended up getting a lawyer i give him like seventy five grand and he started to have me convinced initially he had me convinced i was probably going to go to jail for a few years but really that's what they kind of do to justify you giving them seventy five thousand dollars right and then but the more i thought about it that you know and and read he gave me the guidelines that that supposedly i had i had you know the the fraud that i had committed and what the guy and the guidelines that oversaw that and i read it and i was like i'm not really in trouble here because i'm looking at a felony but i'm not gonna go to jail because there was no potential for the bank to lend to lose money so because i bought the house with like a hard money loan and then i renovated it with my own cash and when i sold it it appraised at two hundred and fifty thousand my my ex wife borrowed like one hundred and eighty so there's plenty of of equity if the whole thing had gone into foreclosure they still would have got their money back and to be honest by the time all this happened there was only like three of the three properties it was like five but we'd already sold a few and at this point we had just sold another two there's like one or two properties left so we're selling at that moment we were selling them so i was like no i kind of argue with them but then he wanted seventy five grand i gave him seventy five grand and then he comes back and he says good news there was no potential fraud so i can get you three years now here's the thing here's here's what i always kind of look back at when i first got went into his office he said he said listen you haven't been indicted yet i spoke with the fbi i spoke with the us attorney they believe and they've been told and he said look they didn't tell me exactly what they have but they said what the the evidence that they have on you based on two confidential informants that it's you cannot go to trial and i was like right of course i knew that and i was like okay he said but he said you haven't been indicted yet and they are fairly certain that you're running a mill right a fraud mill over there and that you guys are churning out fraudulent loans now they can't come in they can't come and raid your office and do anything about it yet cause so far they only have you but here's what i'm saying is that he said i can keep you from being indicted it's called pretrial is a pretrial intervention where we go in and what we'll do what we'll do is you go you work you go in talk to the fbi you go grab a bunch of your mortgage brokers most egregious files grab them bring those files to the fbi go work with the fbi they will indict them and you will not be indicted and i said which i kick myself to this day i said absolutely not i'm not going to snitch on them i'm not going to cooperate i'm not going to you know i'd seen the godfather you're not supposed to cooperate you're supposed to be loyal i'm not going to do any of that and you know and so i say all of this where you know looking back like i would have if i could go back in time i would have gone into our weekly meeting with a dolly and i would have walked in front of everybody and scooped up two or three of the file cabinets and put them in the back of a truck and said listen you guys are going to be talking to the fbi soon i suggest you get attorneys and i would have driven off but i didn't i thought no be loyal you know don't do that and and what happened was when my when the other thing falls apart right when the next scam falls apart every one of these people go to the fbi like they're not even coming to them these guys are going to the fbi with lawyers i want to cooperate i want to tell you what cox did i want to help i want to and i'm thinking like i never had to get indicted to begin with so you think that most of these people from your experience are going to sacrifice all integrity that's a funny word sacrifice i'm not sure that applies to this but that's they're going to sacrifice friendships and loyalty for just to save their own ass yeah that i only had one person that did not talk to the fbi i had one person that every time the fbi or the secret service went to that person's door she said don't come to my house again i don't have anything to say about about matt i have nothing to do with any of this talk to my lawyer and this happened over and over again and that's my ex wife she's a gangster so are there people in this world you trusted or you still trust i you know the the problem is eventually i cooperate and at the time i didn't want to cooperate i didn't believe in cooperation but after seeing how many people cooperate and the way the system is set up i think that my understanding of loyalty is vastly more realistic now and i think that if you're committing crime if if you're absolutely like the things i did i did a bunch of scumbag things you know i mean i'm not killing people but i'm doing scumbag things i'm lying cheating stealing that i'm a thief you know you boil down to it that's what i am so you can't go around behaving like a scumbag dealing with scumbags and then expect those same scumbags to suddenly abide by some kind of a street code and not roll over on you you know and it does happen but it's it's like in the it's in the ninety percentile of people that cooperate ninety something percent and people cooperate when they're not even looking at any real time so if you're looking at thirty years and and especially after going to prison you go to prison and it's like this guy's a stand up guy over here he got thirty years he could have cooperated against all of his co defendants but he didn't nobody comes to see him his wife divorced him you know his kids ended up in foster care his you know his his friends are are are cleaning out his house nobody puts money on his on his his books nobody comes to see him nobody answers his phone nothing he took thirty years most of those guys turned around they ended up getting indicted for other things years later they cooperate and the best thing this guy's got it going for him is that he can walk around and say well he's a standup guy that guy is going to the same halfway house as me he's probably he's going to do thirty years where i'm going to do ten the stand up guy meaning he never snitched right and so everybody's seeing this example and saying well i'm going to snitch then but it it sounds like what people are doing is they're signaling virtue signaling like there are they would never snitch and actually do secretly i mean what is it i i remember i talked to one of the ceos at the prison one time and he said he said i said shit i said fifty percent of the guys here snitched he goes there's more than that he said but listen he was a hundred percent of them are lying about it he said so the old he goes there's nobody here that's gonna tell you they they snitched nobody so there's guys tons of tons of them that cooperate if eighty ninety percent of of defendants cooperate you know you start doing the math and you if you you ask ten guys in prison all of them say i didn't i didn't cooperate i didn't cooperate i didn't cooperate like okay well you ask a hundred i didn't cooperate nobody's gonna say i cooperated does that break your heart a little bit that people backstab each other like this it it does it it does but you know what i have such a low opinion of people you know what i'm saying like i don't expect it it's not that i i don't like people it's that i just don't expect anything of them you know i don't expect you to look out for me you know there was a time when i did i thought i look out for you you should look out for me but i just don't expect that anymore see but i think humanity flourishes because there is a lot of people out there that do the thing that is difficult to do in terms of integrity that may be but these these aren't people with integrity these are criminals if these were decent human beings and all of them will tell you well why'd you do that oh you know i was a drug addict or i needed the money well if you were if you were a decent human being you would have gotten off the drugs you would have gone and gotten three jobs you can work eighty hours a week i've done it you can work eighty four eighty five eighty or ninety hours a week you can do that oh i did it for my kids no you're lazy you could have worked three jobs for your kids instead you decided to sell methamphetamine well i was i was addicted you could have gotten off me it wasn't important it was the easy way out you're not someone with integrity so for you to sit there and say hey i'm going to act like a scumbag but now i got caught or you got caught and i don't want you to tell on me well you're a guy that robs banks you stick guns in people's faces you kidnap people you torture torture people you sell drugs you're not you're not a moral ethical person but you want you want everybody else to hold up to some ethical code while while you're robbing grandma that's not right like you know so you know i i get i get the whole o marta code you know and there was a mo there was a time when i was you know delusional enough to believe that but you know after you go after going through it no and after going through it multiple times no i have to really think about that and i deeply appreciate your honesty on this okay because it's right i i think i mean there's all kinds of criminals in this world and they all have all kinds of stories and your story is one of i don't know if it came from desperation versus a love of this kind of game right like it it it wasn't part of it an attraction to the the creative aspect of this of breaking the rules when nobody else can and you figure out a way to do it i think i think initially it was i needed the money like that's the first thing you know you you say oh okay well i need and if you ask most of them oh well man i needed the money you need the money but and then i i i definitely needed the money but then you get fifty thousand dollars in your bank and then you get a hundred and then it's two hundred and then it's half a million and then it's a million and what the hell are you still committing fraud for you've got half a million or a million dollars in the bank or worth of real estate or you've you're making five dollars ten thousand a month just in rental income why are you still committing fraud so it turned i think it morphs into the creativity in part for me and two it was a chance for me to prove to everybody how smart i was you know i mean it was done out of desperation initially and then it just turned into pure narcissistic arrogance look at me look at how i can do things that nobody else can do look how smart i am i just walked into bank of america handed them seven documents that were all fraudulent and they cut me a check for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars like wow i'm amazing you know and guess what they're never going to get their check and they w they won't know even know where to start to try and find the person because they're looking for a phantom so you know and you feel great i felt great i used to say i i felt like i felt like james bond i felt like double o seven it was amazing and you know and it it did it it feeded my need to feel important you know even if it it it was it was even if that was a lie because all that success was just a lie well no you're good at it it was good at it but it was it's not it was illegal like elon musk you know what i'm saying like there's it's not like you're an ex i'm an exceptional human i'm an exceptional human being at a horrific thing at at committing fraud well the question is how many people are getting hurt because initially the thing is initially nobody got hurt that's the thing nobody ever lost any money directly like i didn't go and say give me fifty thousand dollars and i ran off with your money like i wasn't doing that and that was a great justification but at some point and we'll get into that you know i take off on the run and people do lose money i didn't take that money directly in for some reason in my you know sick mind or whatever the case may be that seems like a distinction to me that makes me feel okay is that i never said give me three hundred give me ten thousand dollars and i ran off with it but i put people in a position where i damaged the credit or damaged the the title to their house and they had to go get a lawyer to fix that you know and and so that they had to go pay a lawyer ten thousand dollars so i absolutely caused that person that i stood to meet to you're a victim and i owe you that money and it was a shitty thing to do because even at the time i was like oh they'll make a couple of phone calls it'll be fine it wasn't fine and if i had really put any thought into it all i would have known it's gonna it's gonna really affect these people and those people had done nothing wrong with the exception of trusting me they rented me their house or they owner finance their house they made the mistake of bumping into me and now they owe ten thousand twenty thousand dollars you know and and i'm sure a a ton of anguish so what happened when you were caught that first time so i i was caught i got three years probation you know i took the probation what does that involve initially it was it was such a slap on the hand on the wrist were you allowed to still practice now okay so i wasn't i had to i couldn't own the mortgage company anymore that was a good question cause like i you would think you know wouldn't it be great if i could keep on going but what they said was you know you you have to forfeit your your brokerage your broker's license and your brokerage business license and what i did was i i transferred my brokerage business license to a guy that essentially bought my business they allowed me to work as a consultant in the mortgage industry you know cause they went you know they go my my lawyer goes to the judge and says what else can he do so and so i have a friend his name's dave walker he was a cpa he came in and he bought my business and he paid me like nine thousand dollars a month and and that covered my bills my wife and i got divorced so she's my ex wife and i i don't know what to do right like i don't i'm i could you know and i would say you know i could have like you know you look back and it's like i could have claimed bankruptcy i could have moved into my parents' spare room you know something like that but you know cause i had i had i lost everything in my divorce i had huge child support payment you know not that that has anything to do like with my my ex wife like i absolutely signed up for that like i wanted to pay that but it was it was it was a chunk of change you know so we're talking about a couple thousand dollars a month for you know for child support she got all of the apartments that we had we had about a million million and a half half dollars worth of apartments which isn't a lot now but that's probably five or six billion dollars now so she got all the apartments so she got everything so now i'm sitting here like i got no i can't be a mortgage broker i can get my nine thousand dollars but i have to help this guy run this company train people do that sort of thing so so what i decided to do was i was going to start flipping houses legitimately or not well initially i thought about doing it legitimately right but at the same time i was also in the middle of figuring out how to make these synthetic identities so i'm making the payments every month remember two months in three months no no credit scores no credit scores no credit scores and i'm also saying i'm going to go i'm going to start buying houses renovate them sell them so to the the truth is we actually renovated probably one house completely i remember it was on twenty sixth street we renovated the house completely on the outside in and the inside yeah outside inside it's done it's good okay great me and me and this guy actually dave dave walker the guy that bought my business so we renovate it and it just so happens at the same time i go to pull credit one day and wow seven hundred plus credit scores and i went we don't have to sell this thing at all like we just we can just i can sell it and put it in this guy's name and let him refinance it and so that's what we did we ended up i ended up selling it to this synthetic identity do you remember the first synthetic identity the name the first one was a joel cologne and then i started getting creative because the ones after that i started naming well so i had like joel cologne and an alan duncan but then i i do remember the movie w reservoir dogs so i started naming the characters after guys in the reservoir dog so i had a i had a a james red you know i had a like a michael white lee black i had william blue david's over brandon green so then i start developing these guys now i thought oh forget those those normal names i'm going with these with the reservoir dogs and i thought i was so cute too do you think in retrospect those are so stupid that was just it's just there's so many things so many mistakes i made i mean within the fraud there are mistakes i made but you know other than just the overall committing fraud but it was just like i thought it was so cute and then you know you get in front of the judge and the judge is hearing about the reservoir dogs and mister mister green and mister black mister white mister this mister and he's looking at me just like you jackass like and you know what am i saying i'm like yeah i thought that was cute you know but nothing's cute so you know plus i'm making fake banks what's the purpose of the fake banks well sometimes you have to have your down payment in the bank right so you have to they have to they want three months worth of bank statements to see that hey he's got his fifty thousand dollars in the bank and then the more the more properties you buy they want start to want to see what's called reserves they want to make sure that you can pay all your mortgage payments if this guy loses his job can this guy maintain all these mortgage payments for the next six months and so they do that and they think you're gonna go you know oh no he can't do it they go well then we won't lend it well when they do that to me i go of course i do of course he's got it let me send you over the bank bank statements oh you wanna call the bank call them so there's a phone number there's a website yes you can call we'll get on there i'll i'll do the whole you know and hold on okay what's the name again or do you have the account number hold on you wait a little bit you know you come out oh okay i gotta hear i i can't tell you the exact amount right now but what is the the what what was his balance last month and you yeah you tell oh yep that that's it exactly okay thank you click would you do different voices or would you be you know i've done different voices or i just have somebody else do it you know gretchen would have done it or or one of the brokers susan would have done it one of the brokers that worked for me or you know kelly or johnny moon or i have so many guys and you know they just get on the phone and they do it because they're all doing something fraud and we're all working together so hey i need you to call this guy i need you to call this guy and verify this and say oh i'm i i i'm at the bank okay i'm at the bank okay cool and they call back and does this feel like an organized system or was it more improv just like dealing with the different situations the government would definitely say it was organized i would say it was you know you're a bunch of you're just a bunch of guys you know to you know it's you're joking around with everybody you're you're helping each other and it's not like everybody's you know kicking up the tommy yeah you know so so and then all these new puzzles come up and you figure out which ways to solve these puzzles you'll go in and you say hey i've got i've got this loan i need to get this loan at this guy's trying to buy this house and i need a loan that looks like this where can we go and by the way they cannot they cannot order a copy of his tax returns so you don't want to have to sign what's called the forty five zero six six so they're like oh okay listen so and so's got a program that you know and you go back and what but you have to have this much in reserve but you got the bank right yeah yeah i got the bank i could do that you know so you you go in and you throw it out there to five or six guys and you're gonna come up with an answer so you're on probation here just to self reflect did you start doing this while on probation because of the money or because it gave you meaning god i you know i mean part a big part of that the reason is i i did not want to move back in with my parents and i didn't want my father to see me struggling and i didn't want him to it was my success he had no idea my success had been the first time he'd ever really been proud of me is that financial success yes at which point when was the first time you told him you did something he was like you could sense him being proud oh when i became a mortgage broke when i when i became a mortgage broker and i went to work for the company and we're talking about within a week i got a client three days later i got a client a week later got a client two days later got a client like i closed four loans my first month and my dad was like well how much money are you going to make and i'm like oh i'm charging this much this i got a point on the back i got this i got to boom i'm thinking i'm gonna walk home after taxes like ten eleven thousand jesus god almighty you know are you sure well we'll we'll see don't start counting your chickens before the you know and and then you know two whatever three weeks later four weeks later you know boom i got a check it's like nine thousand dollars or something or and then you know the next month it's twelve and the next month it's sixteen and then they make me a manager and you know it just he didn't know any of it was illegitimate no he thinks he thinks my son he's brilliant you know he's great he's wonderful i i had you know was certainly not proud of me prior to that but you know my dad was athletic he was extremely bright i mean brilliant and i was a kid who had to be put into special schools who barely graduated high school who ended up going to college and getting a degree in fine arts because i was never going to be able to get a degree in business it wasn't going to happen so when i graduated college i remember with the degree in fine arts he said the best you'll the best thing you could do with that is maybe you could draw caricatures at disney world you know what i'm saying which wasn't a compliment but it wasn't like hey you could draw so yeah he you know and then i turned around and i tried to go to work for state farm insurance which is who he worked for he worked for them for like forty something years and i failed the aptitude test so then i went and worked for another insurance company and i was an insurance adjuster but i couldn't keep up with the workload and then i ended up working construction i'm still barely paying my bills you know and that's basically where my dad felt like that's that's you know he was polite to me you know we was we were you know cordial but yeah i wasn't i think he felt he deserved a better kid so well when you when you started doing mortgages that's when he was like he was like this kid's got something i'm driving i'm driving a new i got it just pulled in in a new car and i got a i just bought a house that was you know four or five blocks away from his house from where i grew up from where he lives you know lived at that time you know six blocks away from where my sister's married to her lawyer husband like i'm doing pretty good and then within three months we bought you know where my new wife we buy a a quadplex and then we're buying a triplex and another quadplex and a ten unit and a duplex and another duplex and a quad plan and it's like what the hell is going on this guy is blowing up he's going on vacation here and vacation here and you know so he you know and so when when when the fbi comes in and they indict me and i take the three years probation like i mean the probably the worst thing in the world you know other than going to prison would have been just having to just sell everything and go move in and start over and sell used cars not that there's anything wrong with selling used cars but i just felt like you know i just didn't want to disappoint him any more than i already had so i i thought i'm going to flip houses and then i'll start maybe a development company so i'll buy some vacant lots and all this and that the problem is these houses on mine for fifty thousand if i fix them up and sell them maybe i make twenty twenty five thousand and then you gotta find a a a qualified borrower it's very hard to find a qualified borrower that wants to live in ybor city back then it's i still think it's rough but those same houses are going for three and four hundred thousand so you know i'm buying houses i gotta i gotta get qualified borrowers i've do all the renovations it's it's a nightmare you know and if i you know looking back it's like okay well then you gotta bite the bullet it's just what you have to do i didn't want to do that i didn't want to do it whether it was laziness or i don't know you know i just thought i'm good at this i'm going to run i'm just going to start running a scam i'm going to figure out how to drive the prices up buy the houses for fifty record them at two hundred thousand and then have these synthetic identities buy all the properties refinance them pull out the cash make six months worth of payments let them all go into foreclosure and that really really started working well very well and i had one time where i had a guy it was james red the synthetic identity was james red and he had bought two or three houses and there was somebody at the office who was friends of somebody who knew the title company where we were closing the loans and he called that her her name was mary and said mary this guy james red like cox is doing something shady james red doesn't even exist she goes and looks at the file her last couple of files and she realizes of course obviously like this guy never showed up she remembers cox picked up the files like and he's saying he doesn't exist so she freaks out she calls the mortgage broker mortgage broker calls me mortgage broker calls me up and says listen mary said she's not closing the next loan unless james red shows up and i went wow that's that's a tough one and she's like okay so what do you wanna do do you wanna go to another title company like we're supposed to close in like three days two three days i said well i mean he's gonna have to show up then i said i'm gonna i'll figure it out like like gimme a couple days gimme let let me figure this out she's like okay well i don't know how that's gonna happen he doesn't exist keep in mind at this point i don't need ids i don't need a real id i mean i can i figured out how to kind of make a real id right like i could make one i could take sandpaper and sand off the information on a regular id and then i would print the the corrected information in reverse on a piece of transparency and i would glue it over there and you could still see the holograms and stuff it actually worked pretty good i don't know if the cops not gonna it's not gonna pass muster with a cop but somebody at the bank like i was able to go in and i would open a bank account with it well so one of the things i had done when i was closing these loans was i would go online and i would pick you have to pick a photo of somebody right to put on the on the driver's license right so i'm not making a fake id for all these guys because i don't need a fake id for all these guys not with my picture on it but i needed a fake i need i need a copy of an id but i need a picture where do i get the picture so i go to hillsborough county's arrest website and i would find people that i knew that had been arrested and so i found a guy named eric tarmago who had been arrested he'd like i don't know what it was the dui or domestic violence i forget what it was but there was a picture of him so i print out the picture i cut it up i paste it onto a driver's license and i make a copy of it you know for for james red that's what i'd been giving the title people when i would close i'd sign all the documents and i'd leave them that copy so that it looked like they made a copy for of the of it and then they would notarize all the documents even though they'd never seen this person they have a copy of his driver's license everything's signed cox said he signed it it's good notarized here's your check so what i do is i think let me see if i can get eric to do this he's been to i knew he'd been prison before so i call up eric and i remember one of my buddies like he's never gonna do this and i was like i i think he will i think he will so and that's how and that's really the that kind of like you think what do you think but no let me try let me call him i don't know bro like that's the kind of conversations you're having like it but really looking back like i think the opener few sentences that you have with him i got i can tell you exactly what i said because it's burned in my mind mhmm he comes in so what eric was doing at that time he was actually working for us he worked for somebody else but periodically we would you know we'd buy a house and we'd call him up and we'd say hey can you you you and your boss can you guys come over and trim the trees of this house trim all the trees take all the crap in the yard clean it up they go yeah sure no problem cause that's what he did worked for like a handyman service so they would come and they clean it up and they do that so i said can you come over and he goes like yeah so he comes to the office whatever a few hours later and i he comes in the conference room i said hey eric what's going on and he says he says hey you know how's it going i said yeah i said listen i said i i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you something i need a favor he's like okay cool he's like what is it i said you know all these houses we've been having you go and clean up he's like yeah we had that you had you painted that one house you did this yeah yeah yeah i know i know right so here's what we've been doing i've been buying these houses for fifty thousand dollars recording for two hundred and then i have these fake people buy them and i explain i just lay it out for him and he's like wow that's he's like that's fucking bro that's ingenious man that's that's smart like wow oh and you know i was like okay i said yeah i know that's great so here's the thing i said the title company who's been closing some of these loans and we have a closing in a couple of days she wants this guy james red to show up and i need someone to show up as james red and he goes wow he goes who are you going to get to do that and i was just thinking just like you're not understanding i'm not confiding in you because i need a friend you know so and i looked at i said well i was thinking you might do it he was like because that's a big favor mhmm i said i it is a big figure i could be in a lot of trouble and i said i i know and he goes well wait a minute because i can't go he said you have to give these people a driver's license you said the driver's license is you were you you were using mug shots she's you said she's closed a couple of these she already she's seen this guy's picture and i go she has seen this picture i said the thing is for james redd i pulled the mugshot offline of you when you were arrested a couple years ago and he jumps up and he goes joe motherfucker and i go oh i said eric i said wait a minute i said hold on hold on i said listen i said i only did that because i knew if it came down to this moment you were the only person that i knew that could pull this off that have the balls to walk in and do it and he sat there and he went yeah you're right you're right and i mean i i well i i couldn't believe he fell listen this guy would beat the brakes off me he was he's like five ten five eleven he's boxed he's a big guy yeah so you know it's like i've weathered that part of the storm and he sat there and he goes right right and he goes well i'm not doing it for free i'm not doing it for nothing i said no bro of course not i mean well you know what he's like you're making a lot of money i said well keep in mind a lot of that money goes back in the prop property it's not like we're walking away with you know i think i said like tens of thousands we're really walking away with hundreds of thousands this is not like we're walking away with a bunch of money or you know it's you know we gotta put it by that we gotta buy more properties we gotta keep it going we gotta make the payments you know i know but still i can get in a lot of trouble i said i understand bro i go well what do you want and i remember thinking if he asked for more than like ten or fifteen thousand like i'll just i'll do it myself we'll just change title companies and we'll go and i'll i'll do it myself and he sat there and he went i want five hundred dollars and i went five hundred dollars listen i almost started laughing i mean i was like i put my hand over my i was like five hundred dollars yeah it's it's it's gonna take you thirty minutes yeah and he's like he's like i don't care bro i get in a lot of trouble i was like oh well yeah i'm not paying you now you gotta sign first and he's like oh you know i'll sign i'll sign i know you're good for it i know you're for five hundred bucks i made a fake id form he goes in to the place he signs james red comes out what was even funny what was funny about that was when we walked into the title company we're sitting in the in the lobby and mary comes walking out and she looks at me and she goes mr cox i don't know why you're here she was i told kelly that was the broker she was i i told the broker that i'm not closing the loan unless unless james red shows up and eric stands up on queue and he goes i'm james red and she was like and she goes hold on a second she runs in the back comes back with a file opens it up looks at the picture and she's like oh i'm i'm so sorry give me five minutes i'll i'll i've got the file i prints up the docs he goes in signs and when we're there she's passing out the checks five thousand here twenty five thousand here thirty five thousand here seven thousand here six thousand here so he sees all these checks and i'm like well i i i got that i and then the construction coming in no no no i i have that i i'll take care of that i'll take care of that so i get all the checks and i leave we go sit in my audi and he sits down and he's like bro it's a lot of money it was a lot of that money goes back in the properties eric and he's like i still bro and i said and i had counted out five hundred bucks but listen a week later mhmm we had another closing so i he comes in i said hey bro he's hey what's going on and i said i need you to do the the james red thing he was yeah i've been thinking about that i did that way too cheap i said i get it man well how much do you want what do you want and i'm thinking if if it's if it's more than ten or fifteen i'll do it myself and he sits there and he goes i want a thousand dollars i go a thousand dollars like oh my god so i gave him a thousand dollars and we he he did another one and but by that point it was like five or six we'd done five or six with that guy and after five or six plus the credit cards plus you know all the other things like their credit scores start dropping you know if it was seven hundred now it's down to like six hundred and at six hundred you couldn't really borrow enough to make it worth it so like and i have other people in the wings waiting so you know we would just we'd i'd go out and i i'd run up the credit cards and and pull them as much money pull all the money out of the out of the banks and close the accounts and then stop paying and you said a lot of people knew so he was one of the people that he was one of the people why do you think nobody said anything i well i mean i think everybody was making money the appraiser at that time i had an appraiser eventually i ordered the appraisal software and i just started doing the appraisals myself like why give this guy five hundred bucks so so you were doing the appraisal yourself bro i'm doing the how's that possible how's that is there a check against it is there there is it's just funny nobody ever questions that you actually have to have a license to get the appraisal software so i get an appraisers that we're working with i get her license and i i i create a an email address as her so it was a synthetic appraiser right it was a real person but i end up ordering the appraisal software by by emailing it was called alamo alamo appraisal software so i end up emailing them as her and they go well we can't give you we can't sell you the software unless we we need a copy of your license boom here's your license so i send her the i send then the license and then we pay for it with a credit card you know you could go get like a green dot card you go put five hundred bucks on it or a thousand the software was like fifteen hundred bucks or something so you pick them like back then you know it was a long time ago so fifteen hundred bucks they mail it to us and now i've got the software so now i can you know i can do the appraisals myself what stops you from appraising it not for two hundred thousand but even more there's no comparable sales so no matter what you sent to the bank they're going to look at it like they're going to have their in house appraiser is going to do a desktop review he's going to go online he's going to check to make sure all the appraise all of the comparable sales are sold for what you said they sold for are the same square footage were built what the pictures look like where how far they are they're just gonna double check everything but you know he's some guy who's on salary and he does you know whatever forty or fifty of these a day or something it doesn't take them long and so it's cheaper that way where we pay for the appraiser appraisals the whole thing got it so everybody's getting paid right and so at this point i'm i'm doing that right you know and i'm getting caught periodically can you give an example what do you mean getting caught i'm living in tampa heights which is right next to ybor city in tampa right so this is all these are all like little suburbs of tampa and they're all built back in the 1920s right 1890s nineteen ten nineteen twenty so i've i bought this eight unit building i renovated it into a triplex i mean i'm driving an audi i'm dating a a woman that i should not have been dating like i mean i don't know what she was thinking so i'm you know i'm we're going on vacations like everything life's good so but every once in a while you know like we're you know we're things happen you get a phone call hey this is what just happened and i one time i got a phone call from same broker kelly kelly called me up and said listen we got a problem this was i want to say this was alan duncan this was one of the first ones that i had done right but we we used him but and so he so she calls me up and says listen alan duncan never made his first mortgage payment and i had a friend of mine or one of my codefendants when we closed on that loan we both got checks for whatever forty or fifty grand keep in mind we're also buying some of this money's going into a business account we're buying property we're buying so it's not like i'm pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars or even you know even twenty or thirty thousand dollars on every closing i'm more like i'm getting twenty five ten twenty and this guy's getting ten and this guy's getting fifteen and then we're taking sixty and we're putting it into the business account we're buying a bunch of vacant lots or we're building some new houses so we're trying to kind of take all this and turn it into a development company but we still have to pay our bills so you know my buddy's got to go to he's got to go to amsterdam at least for two weeks you know he's from belgium that's you apparently have to do that at least once a year so he he was so when i gave him his check the check i said look you're gonna make the here's the like twenty grand or fifteen grand but you got to make the payments on this thing for the next six months he was no problem i said okay so she calls me up a month and a half later and says hey alan duncan did not did not make his first payment and i went oh my god and i re i he was actually renting the apartment downstairs for me so i run downstairs and i opened the door and i go bro i'm like did you make duncan's payment and he turns around and he's like is it due and i was like oh my god so i run back you know i i grabbed the phone i'm like he didn't make it he didn't make it she's like okay well here's what's happening the account executive is calling they've got the file and it was called southstar bank southstar bank has it they're reviewed it they've already been ordering documents they they they're saying that this guy there said there's a problem there it's it's it's falling apart like the whole thing's falling they they they know something's wrong but they don't know exactly what it's just something suspicious at that she didn't tell me that on the phone okay like she she's saying there's something wrong they're freaking out yeah because the account executive didn't really know she just got a phone call saying hey have you ever met this this broker did she meet the guy who is the guy he hasn't paid we're calling the cell nobody's answering and really most of this was was my buddy rudy's fault he's not doing any of this stuff he any of the things he's supposed to be doing so we go to the office and i call south star bank i get the secretary and i said look i need to talk to whatever the guy the big guy was it was one of them was like the president and one was like the somebody else anyway vice president so i said i need to talk to so and so the vice president and she says i'm sorry he's in a business meeting i said well listen tell him this is alan duncan like you need to go tell him as alan duncan's on the phone right now i'm assure you he wants to talk to me and she's like all right hold on and i mean like twenty seconds later you know speaker phone hey mr mr duncan this is so and so and you know i'm here with the with our lawyer and the president of the bank and our head of fraud mhmm we were just discussing you and i was like okay i understand that you guys are i haven't made my first payment i said it actually came back in the mail i had the wrong address that was completely my fault and i apologize i said but i can get you a cashier's check today i will overnight it no problem hope that's gonna be okay as they as they said way we're way past that way past that i said okay well what's what's the issue and they were like i mean look to be honest i don't think i'm talking to alan duncan i don't think there is an alan duncan he's like i mean your social security number was issued a couple of years ago the we called the bank and and this was i we had gone with like south or sun trust bank right so it was a real bank so it wasn't our normal bank and they called they don't they don't have any record of you and i was like well i've never been happy with southstar bank there if you know it sounds like a banking error mhmm and they're and they're like yeah i don't think this isn't cute he says i don't think i'm talking to alan duncan right now right and you were a terrified terrified i'm but you have to be playing it cool i guess i mean i know what am i gonna say no you're talking to matt cox like i i can't say that like i'm just gonna keep running with it just like okay well look you know and he's like you know we call the dmv this you know they don't have a list for you in the in the you know in their website we think that the you know we don't think you exist yeah you know we're still waiting for a phone call back from who so so and so and so and so and i'm just like oh my god and i said have you called have you called the authorities yet and they were like no we haven't but once we put our file together we will and then the head of the fraud department they said oh by the way mister i forget his name but the head of the fraud department is the head worked for the fbi for like ten years or something or twelve years and i and i so i mean i'm just like and by the way the the broker is there and my buddy rudy is there and i mean they're he's pacing the room she's in tears crying like there and i'm like okay well fellows i said where's this headed where's this going what are we doing and and they so they're they're kind of chuckling and joking about it and i remember being like thinking what's the deal like it's weird and i said look well why don't i just let me just pay you back and i said ah well we'll we'll get the money we're not worried about it i said you don't seem worried about the money about getting any of the money back like don't why don't you just let me i'll cut you a check i can get you the money back like what do i i owed them like one fifty or something i forget exactly there's nothing like i owe you a hundred fifty thousand let me cut your check for a hundred fifty thousand and they were like no no you know that's we'll get the money back when we foreclosed on the property and that's when i was like oh they think the property's worth like one hundred and ninety five thousand dollars or something and i went oh i said i understand okay i said do you have the appraisal in front of you mhmm and they were like yeah and i said open it up i said take a look at comp number one that's owned by a guy named you know lee black comp number two you know is owned by you know whatever david silver whatever the names were and i'm like you know like black silver red i said i am all those people and i said let me tell you what i've done and i tell them just laid out boom boom boom boom boom i said so you can call the fbi but you're not going to get all your money back or you can let me give you your money back and we can let this we can let sleeping dogs lie the whole thing goes away i apologize you know i had every intention of making all the payments it's a glitch you caught me nope my bad and so these guys are all just like oh my god like now they're they put me on hold they're looking through the file they come back and i remember at some point we go back forth back forth and finally they come back and they said listen you still have the money i said yeah well first they come back they threaten me oh well when the f we give us to the to the fbi you're i said that's not true i said the money was deposited into a bank account it has since been moved the bank account bank account has been closed it's been removed in cash that money is gone you will never see that money i will be cutting you if i pay you back at all it'll be from another account account and so the fbi agent ends up saying he's right even if we caught him red handed the likelihood that any of these funds will be ever be recouped is zero like there's almost no money's ever recouped and so we ended up they put me on hold again they come back and they go how quickly can you get us a cashier's check and i go like that day i go get them a cashier's check overnight the cashier's check they never called the fbi they never did anything now at that point we actually ditched that whole that james or alan duncan i remember at that point we went to the mall ran up all the credit cards and just threw everything away and walked away because it was shop you know that whole that guy was shot i think we borrowed whatever eight hundred thousand dollars or nine hundred thousand in his name so with the banks it's really really all about the money that listen when i go on the run i got one where i was caught so red handed it's it's insane how how bad it was and listen that's not that's nothing i got caught by washington mutual one time i was caught by washington mutual where we had done six owner occupied duplexes so if you say you're going to live in a house you can get about ninety five percent financing but if it's an investment property you got to put down twenty percent you get about eighty percent financing so a buddy of mine who was a sheriff's deputy we had his wife by i'm going to say six owner occupied duplexes saying she lived in every single one of them well you can't own or occupy six dwellings like if that's fraud now granted her w2s and pay stubs were correct but she didn't put the down payments down even the down payments we didn't put down we actually got cash back but months later we the they called the a lawyer from washington mutual ends up calling the mortgage broker and saying that they ended up with two of the owner occupied duplexes because washington mutual had a credit line extended to one of the lenders who'd lent the money so it actually was washington mutual so it was a couple months later when they went to sell sell it in you know they package them together and sell them they realized we have the same customer with two duplexes side by side both owner occupied this is fraud so she comes in she tells me oh my gosh this lawyer's on the phone this is what happened i'm like oh wow this is horrible i ended up getting on the phone with him we have a huge we have a conversation and i'm like you know he's like look you know this is a big deal we could call the fbi i'm like look who knows who was involved in this maybe somebody on your side was involved maybe somebody on my side i don't know what my mortgage broker did i'll deal with her on my own why don't you just let us refinance the properties not only did we talk him into refinance allowing us to refinance the properties he gave us a reduced a reduced balance of what we owed him because we couldn't we couldn't borrow enough to pay him off so they took like a twenty thousand dollars hit just to refinance those properties never called the fbi never did any it was absolutely fraud i had a broker one time we got called with over a million dollars in loans that he had done that were fraudulent pinnacle bank corp which was out of chicago the owner called me and he was like look your mortgage broker did this like there was a bunch of canceled checks they were fake canceled checks so they look like they had run through the bank for this somebody's rent but they hadn't does that make sense like you pay your rent they deposit it it goes to the bank and they've got all the numbers and everything well i had a bunch that were blank that all you had to do was sought fill out your your borrower's information and then you cut and pasted his full his name and his address at the upper left hand corner you make a copy of it it looks like canceled checks we had twenty four of them well my one of my brokers was using them for all of his files like even if the person really had a rental history he didn't want to order it he just did this it was easier it's faster yeah wow so they catch a million dollars worth of loans they call me up and then they caught another million dollars but they had already sold them to household bank so while i'm on the phone with the owner his name's gary and we're talking he's like look this is what we found this is this this is what happened and i remember i said gary at the end of this conversation if you think i've cutting you a check for a million dollars i said i just don't want to have it they don't have it and this was when i owned the mortgage company and he says no i what i'm asking you for your word that if any of these come back on us they're in florida they're in your area you'll help us get rid of the properties you'll we'll foreclose we're going to have to resell them i don't want to be flying down there just help us get rid of them i said absolutely of course no problem i said what about the i said well what are you gonna do with them he goes well they're gonna be a part of a a package like a three million dollars package we're selling we we are going to take care of it it's not what happened in fact gary flew down a couple of weeks later took me and several of the brokers not that broker but several of the brokers out to dinner mhmm had a few drinks and he openly admitted he's like look i don't care if all the loans have fraud in them as long as they don't come back on me that's what i'm concerned about because there's a clawback clause for one year he's like so if they can perform for one year i don't care that was it how many people in the industry do you think are operating like this and by like this i mean in the aforementioned gray area i would say there's probably after like the like after the two thousand and eight financial crisis i would say it cleaned up considerably but i would say at this point it's it's just as bad as it ever was and keep in mind these a lot of the loans that caused the problems were like you know they call them liar loans or or you know you know no qual no qualification no qual loans right no income well those loans are they exist again like there are subprime companies that are doing that again they're not the cut i don't think they call them subprime anymore they call them so they got some other name yeah rebranded yeah they rebranded a little bit but it's it's happening all over again it just seems the whole the whole real estate slash banking system is very prone to this kind of corruption i i mean but but how but how how can you fix it like if if a lot of the things they fixed a lot of the manipulation they fixed but if you tighten it too much then the average person can't get a loan like you you you so you you know and and the thing is some of these loans sometimes changing a w two you know should that person have gotten in that into that house no he shouldn't have he didn't qualify but he makes all of his payments so it was like is it a fraudulent loan yeah but it performs mhmm so you know i think that i would say that i forget what the fbi statistic was it was like twenty percent or thirty percent prior to the two thousand prior to the financial crisis it was like twenty or thirty percent of like bank loans they were saying that contained some kind of fraud even if it was just a lie you know if you wanna cut thirty percent out of the out of the you know that that's a ton that's a ton so you're on probation and you're doing these you're almost getting caught you're almost getting caught and you're doing these really large scale scams how does it get to the point where you're on the run so i'm doing multiple scams right so it's not just that i'm doing the scams with the the reservoir dog scams right i'm not just doing those guys i'm also creating other identities because i've got other people that are involved they they wanna do a scam mhmm so this chick i was dating she wanted to she wanted to run a scam so i set up a scam it's semi complicated but the bottom line is she ends up stealing a real person we we we steal a real person's identity i have a real person's identity we get a driver's license in her name open up some bank accounts go rent a piece of property in her name and i transfer the deed or the deed from the property out of the real owner's name i transfer it into her stolen identity we then refinance the house like three or four times and so she starts going to these different closings and she's her name is alison and she's pretending to be a puerto rican woman named rosie to perez alison has brown hair and blue eyes rosie de perez clearly doesn't yeah so alison when when when we make the id she dyes her hair black curls it a little bit and gets the pictures pictures taken of herself but before she goes to the first closing to get a check for like a hundred thousand dollars and we've got like three of these scheduled she she changes her hair color like the she dyes it back like like a dirty blonde and she goes to the first closing and she gets a check a check for a hundred thousand let's say i don't know what it was like ninety five or a hundred and five whatever roughly a hundred thousand dollars she gets a check at the closing they give it to her we then go to the next closing well at the next closing the the title person has her sign all the documents but she's looking at her like something's not right looks at her id makes a copy of the id looks at it and says this this doesn't look like you and she's like you know you don't look hispanic and she's like i'm half hispanic what do you what and she's like you don't i mean but keep in mind the photograph was her so she's saying this doesn't look like you but it's her granted that she had you know the curly hair a little bit but that's it so allison is like it's me and she's like look i'm not going to give cut you i'm not gonna give you the check yeah i'm gonna let you sign the documents you know we can get you can get the check i'll i'll let you know so she goes gets in my car she said yeah listen there's a problem so we're driving on the road she explains it to me i realized you know okay that's done it's over we're we're not going back she said what about the other closing no no no more closings we're done and and i you know and it was probably more of a yell screaming and yelling like what the hell did you do why i told you not to change your hair why would you change your hair like that when she came in like the day before and i was like what did you do what did you do and she's like she's my hair what's the big deal it's still me sure enough you know and that's like it's not that i knew that that was going to happen but why tempt fate how'd you meet allison like what was a mortgage broker okay and and i had done some fraudulent she needed she worked for another mortgage company sorry she worked for another mortgage company she couldn't get a loan closed the owner of that mortgage company called me and said look we got a loan we need it closed and i said great and i when guys would call me i'd say great i'll come pick it up i'll give you a three hundred dollars or a five hundred dollars referral fee no no it's a couple hundred thousand dollars we wanna close it well if you then close it well i can't close it we need a w two or we need this we need that we can't figure out how to do it so i go over there and typically i convince them just give it to them it's not gonna close she was she was she was you'd have to see this chick she was gorgeous she was gorgeous very flirtatious made me feel like i was thin and handsome so like she gets whatever she wants yeah so i'm like okay look here's what you do and i explained to her do this do this do this send it here it'll close and should we close it well then she starts calling me right hey how's it going we go to lunch next thing you know we start sleeping together she realizes what's happening she says i wanna i went in on this so now we do the closings we're on our way i say look that check's dead what if she goes what about the other the other one i go no no it's all dead we're walking away now that was easy for me to say because for me i had money she's going through a divorce she's broke you know like none none of this did i take into consideration at the time by the way to me it's like nah that's dead we're done we're we'll start over again well and she's to her in her mind she was about to make what we were getting probably that was a million dollar scam she was about to end up getting you know whatever it was half or one third of half a million dollars in the next week now she's got nothing so she says look let's at least cash this one and i had a buddy named travis hayes who had been you know we actually were we've been friends since high school we were like best friends right really close friends in high school we were still close travis was running a scan scam this one was hers was in clearwater his was in orlando so i'm all i'm getting on all over the state at this point right so he's running an orlando scam that's already yielded half a million maybe more he's still pulling we're still refinancing properties right so he's about to close on another half a million dollars worth of properties he's got a a bank account that's open she says let's give it to travis have him deposit it in his account he's already pulled out like three hundred thousand out of the account and she's like shouldn't be a problem i was like no no no and she was let me call him she calls him i think i called him and he i explained the situation he's using is okay and i said no i don't think it's okay i don't think it's okay at all and he's like no it's not a big deal just give me the give me the check so i give him the check he goes he deposits the check they say they're gonna hold it till it clears you know that was kind of a thing back then it takes i don't know how long it took five days six days whatever it was he was supposed to go back and it would have cleared and he would have been able to start pulling money out and so i call him one day because is bugging me so i call him and i go hey where are you at he goes i'm actually on my way to orlando and i said oh okay so you'd bet let alison know i'm not getting any money he said the bank manager called and said that because the check was over a hundred thousand dollars they have to witness me endorsing the back of the check or they had to see my something right and for me to come in i'm a oh i said something's wrong something's wrong don't go to the bank what do you think is wrong i think the cops are waiting for you that's what i think is wrong and he goes no the cops aren't he goes man i'm i'm in the parking lot right now i just pulled pulled in the parking lot there's no cops i'm like they're not gonna be in squad cars like and he's like no he said it's fine you're overreacting bro and i'll never forget what he said he said you're shaking like a little girl bro calm down i got this i'm cool with the manager like the manager like because you've chopped it up with the manager he's gonna let your fraudulent check go through so he walks in the cops are in there they locked the door he just told me later you know they closed the door locked it the cops are in there they grab him and they bring him downtown he didn't say anything he won't say anything that's not true by the way but he's so here's what he told me he wouldn't say anything alright i told him i'm not talking to you coppers oh he told her yeah he told you but he actually did he actually did talk to him so he what he ends up doing what ends up happening is we can't get in touch with him yeah so we're calling and calling calling and then finally i decide you know what i'm not gonna call his cell phone anymore i'm gonna call the name of the person he was the the synthetic identities number right so i go and i call the synthetic identities number i call and i say somebody answers and i go hey is so and so there and he said and it's a gruff authoritarian voice you know it's this is law enforcement and he's and he's like no who's this he goes no he goes no this is officer so and so who's this and i go i was like this is lee black i said he said he was how do you know so and so i was like oh no no click and i just hung up and i called for like a pay phone so i turned around and i said he got arrested and then later on that night he showed up on the the county website you know the the arrest website showing he had been arrested and the next day he calls me and he asked me to get him out of jail like hey i i you gotta go so i have to give his brother-in-law money you know we get him out of jail he actually got out for yeah he got out for like nothing and here's where i should have known that he was cooperated it went from like dollars three hundred thousand bond down to like dollars ten thousand mhmm so it's a thousand bucks so right then i didn't know it at the time but obviously that means we're gonna let him out of jail where he's cooperating so they let him out of jail i go and i get him a lawyer a state this was state by the way it wasn't federal so i get him a lawyer for like fifteen thousand dollars i he come you know he comes there of course he tells me look they asked me a bunch of questions i told him that you know i that he you know he made up some story about there's an he's working with another guy but he doesn't know the guy's name he made up a name like there's a whole he has this whole kind of thing where he tells them about me but not me and he's like and then you know the the numbers none of the numbers led anywhere so they all lead to cell phones that are only being used for those scams so it's a dead alley or blind alley and i'm like okay okay and i mean i'm paying him like he's coming in man i my truck's no good i need another truck i buy him another truck hey man my the electric's gonna get turned off and i don't have oh i'm i'm i need a thousand dollars of course here's a thousand dollars i don't know what i was i'm embarrassed you had to ask here's a thousand you know week later you know he needs two thousand for this a thousand for this two thousand for this he wants to start a tree trimming company he needs to buy a tree trimmer how much are those five thousand of course i find ten so i give him another twenty five thousand it starts like a tree trimming business which he runs to this day what i don't know is that you know the whole time he's actually working with a task force that's been put together federal or this is state at this point it's a state task force cause there's multiple counties involved at this point and it wasn't hard for him to explain like this this is this comes back to reservoir dogs i got a much all he had to say to the officers was listen you gotta let me go i can't do any prison time i'm going to tell you about a much much bigger scam and they go okay well how can you prove that scam pull up hillsborough county hillsborough county's tax appraiser website okay look up the name james red look all of these were built bought six months ago six months later they're all in foreclosure pull up lee black all of these were bought look six months later all of them are foreclosure hey pull up james you pull up brandon green pull up so all of these are going in foreclosed i mean it's it's so it's like you know that what i thought was so cute not cute there was just stupid and so he very quickly they put together a task force he's working with them on the task force and we're still buying houses flipping houses doing everything cause i'm i believe him i believe he's not you know he's saying look if i have to go to jail for you know a year or so like you know and he is also paying you know he hasn't paid them back yet but he but we're saying he can pay them back like it's like look if we get to the point you know when we get to that point like we'll pay them back but we haven't paid them back yet cause we have no way to show where that money came from we can always go to like one of his relatives and gives the give his dad forty grand give his mom twenty grand you know that kind of stuff and start putting money that way and all that money was taken out in cash too so we could always show up with a chunk in cash regardless you know it's still in the process and i think that we're still in the process and it could be six months or a year away cause it's a slow thing i've already been through the process my first time when i got in trouble and it was a year but from the time that i was spoken to until i pled guilty and was sentenced so i'm not concerned about it well that's happening we're still flipping properties and one day i have a buddy named steve sutton remember the sheriff's deputy and keep in mind it's funny because like i've done bad loans for police officers sheriffs lawyers doctors like you know across everybody these aren't like all you know yeah everybody guys that you know these aren't all like you know construction workers or guys that work at you know our mechanics or something these are like the legitimate these are legitimate people that have credit problems or whatever the case may be so one day i'm sitting at work and i'd been getting phone calls for the prior week from people at title companies saying hey matt wanted to let you know we just had some subpoenas served on several of your files and i'm concerned like that had me concerned then a guy named jeff testerman starts making phone calls jeff testerman is a reporter for the st petersburg times he's calling people saying hey i noticed that you sold a piece of property to lee black have you ever met mr black he seems like and they're like just hanging up on him or saying no i don't know what you're talking about i'm not sure what that guy's name was let me call you back and i'm getting phone calls from people so i know something's up with the newspaper now now i know something's being looked at but nobody's really talking i know that there are subpoenas being being served and i'm i'm nervous you know i'm i'm very concerned and then one day i'm in my office and the sheriff's deputy walks in steve sutton in his uniform too which everybody always stiffened you know when he would walk in so he walks in i go steve i said what's going on in his head and usually he's jolly and laughs and stuff and he goes and he says i gotta talk to you outside i was like okay i walk outside what's up and he says i i used to date this girl in the like the tampa police department or something right i was like okay he said she showed up at my house this morning at like six o'clock in the morning i went okay he said she said that she's been working on a task force and he said apparently one of your buddies got arrested in orlando they're investigating some other thing in clearwater they're investigating a ton of properties here in in ybor tampa heights and i mean there's like a hundred properties involved and my name came up because you've sold some properties to me which i had and he's like so she came to me and said look your buddy cox he said and i go i was like okay he goes he said well the task force is on you and she said to stop talking to you because they're going to come arrest you in a couple of days they just handed over the task force findings to the to the fbi and the fbi is going to come arrest you in a couple of days and she said not to talk to you because and because you're you're going to cooperate and because all

thousand here's six here's nine and had them go into all these different bank accounts pulling out cash but this is like a thursday at four o'clock so the next day they show up with cash write some more checks they go again i get about eighty grand in cash that's all i can get i i i go home that night i start packing my bags and i was dating this this chick named rebecca halk we've been dating about a month and she shows up at my house you know i hadn't returned our phone calls all day and apparently we're supposed to go out and i'd forgotten about it i had bigger issues and so i'm packing a couple of duffel bags and she walks in and she's like what's going on i'm like i'm leaving where are you going it's always supposed to go out at session go do something tonight i'm like i'm leaving it's over and and she says what happened i tell her what happened this is what happened she's like oh my god like she had no idea well she had no idea about anything you were done no i barely knew her like i mean she's coming over two three times a week for a month like i've you know this isn't love this isn't you know this is a booty call that's all it is like we're hanging out or having sex and that's it i don't even know you so she suddenly just begs to come with me you gotta bring me with you you have to this you have to that i'm like what are you talking about like you you've got a you've got a son you have your mom lives here you're and she's just in tears and crying and she suddenly said and this is what's so funny about it is that she had just moved from vegas to to st petersburg to work at the dog track to work for a company that owned the dog track right but a casino interest or a yeah like a gambling company and she said you don't even know why i'm here i was like okay why are you here she said i'm here because i was working for a law firm that worked for the the casino company that i worked for she said i got caught embezzling nothing it was like ten or fifteen thousand dollars from my boss because she had a gambling habit and she said he didn't call the police because we were sleeping together and he was afraid his wife would find out she said so instead he banished me here to st pete my son just came to live with me he's been caught sneaking out cause he her the father had raised him he'd only been living with her since she got to florida and and she's like i was about i was gonna send him back he's failing school he's smoking pot he's been caught sneaking out after curfew i'm like oh okay i don't know any of this she's like he was going back in december or no he was going back after the school year which would have been like may okay and i'm like so where before five minutes earlier i thought she was this sweet secretary sweet innocent secretary and and she's like you know i've been married three times i am a gambler i've claimed bankruptcy i'm sleeping with my old boss i got like you know she went from this you know thieving adulteress you know and i thought these are all really beneficial to my you know my future plans yeah you know and i shouldn't have at that moment you know i was so just flipped out and concerned and up and leaving your life and everything you know behind that's that's terrifying and you know and and so now you're alone in a strange place and if that's the first time you've done something like that like leave to go on the road yes so i'd never just up and moved and keep in mind now i can't call home i can't like i'm leaving there there are things that i feel like get you caught and every you know i've watched tons of these tv shows and you know there are certain things that get you caught and you know one of them is keeping in contact with anybody in your old life so i'm thinking that's that's not gonna happen like i'm not i'm not contacting anybody i'm leaving and that's it that didn't really happen i kept in touch i called my mom every once in a while but i was like okay that's cool did the loneliness of that hit you early on or no like the as you're i never did well you're leaving your life i mean there's a it feels like a fundamental transition oh listen you think i mean look it's not just that like i'm leaving my my son i have a son and i'm you know i was i was leaving everything i was just terrified of going going to prison and you know i mean i don't know it was just it was just so stupid it was just arrogance and you know i should have stayed like i made things so much worse but i also thought i'm smart i can i can figure this out like i can change my identity blend in i'll be fine doctor aren't you already like people know what your face looks like they do they do but i one of the first things i did was i got plastic surgery what what kind of plastic surgery i've got i've got a nose job mhmm i got what they call a mini facelift they go in through your back of your ears and they suck out all the fat in your neck does that change appearance much a little bit i got i was balding i got two hair transplants you know two hair grafts so the hair and my head this isn't my hair it's my hair but it's from back here mhmm so there's they cut it from here and they that's great i appreciate it so they reimplanted it there you know got liposuction just some you know other stuff and you know got my teeth done that sort of thing you know so you know and i that's was kind of like my plan i'll go i'll take off i got eighty grand i'll steal some more money you know but i let her come with me and we ran up all my credit cards over the next few days packed up the car traded in my my audi and got like an audi i don't know was it like an a six or like a ford or like a big ford or whatever it was got that and drove straight to atlanta and so i wrote a letter to my parents before i left just explaining this is what's happening i'm leaving i'm done i'm not going to prison love you sorry sorry sorry sorry i know i'm a disappointment sorry bam so i take off go to atlanta when we went to atlanta i already had the name of a guy named scott cugno that i'd done alone for so i had his his you know his his vital information right like i have his name date of birth social security number mother's maiden name and where he was born one day we were having a conversation and i just slowly pride all that out of him right like i already i we've done a loan for him so i had his name date of birth social security number but i need to steal his identity i need to know where he was born and his mother's maiden name so through the course of a conversation i just pride you know hey you know cugno is that you know what is that is that like irish is it no it's such and such or what's your mom's name oh such and such oh okay yeah you know we were born here you're born in in where why aren't you from oh man i was born here i was born in such an oh hillsborough county you know like i so it was no big deal we get to atlanta i make a fake id for both of us but keep on i don't i don't have like i don't have a driver's license i i do but they're they're fake like i can't give this to a to a cop can't give a driver's license that says david freeman what's david's residence florida or is this georgia no no this is florida okay but it was just a made up name okay i'd gone to like high school with a kid named david freeman so i had an id but i can't give that to a cop like that's enough to get like rent a place or do something or so we go go to atlanta make an id set it up make some business cards set up a couple of websites set up some get an hq which is that like a it's a company that will you can do virtual you can rent virtual you rent offices and they'll answer your phone for like a hundred bucks a month and they'll afford them so it seems like you have a an office they'll they you know they give you a phone number that you call up and they say you know hi united southern bank you know and they'll answer the phone and and forward messages so we get one of those make a business card for for becky she rents a house from a guy named michael shanahan so we rent michael shanahan's house it's like two hundred thousand dollars two hundred thousand dollars house in alpharetta and i then go to alabama wait i then order scott cugno's birth certificate social security card i think i registered to vote in his name and i and we i made a lease agreement in his name and i think that's all i needed and then i went to alabama and got a driver's license in his name so i went into the dmv give them all these documents and which are almost all of them are real except for the lease they said sit over there i sit over there i sit down boom twenty minutes later i have a driver's license it's you know it was twenty something dollars it was nothing so i get the driver's license now i'm driving this i'm still driving a car that an audi that is in the name of matt cox so i parked that i then go get social security to issue me a social security number and the name scott cugno and i then turn around and i go and i get a loan you put down twenty thirty percent there's all these first time or first time buyers thirty percent down rent get like a honda or something so now we're living in a house we've got some furniture bedroom furniture and i go downtown i pull the title to this guy michael shanahan's house and i go downtown and i satisfy the loan on his house so he had two loans with bank of america and so i i may create two satisfaction of loans from bank of america so michael shanahan owns a house and the name of michael shanahan he has one mortgage with bank of america and a second one when you pay your mortgage off the way public records knows it's paid off is they mail public records a satisfaction of mortgage it's a one page document and it's notarized so i filled out two i created two of them i just ordered you know you can redo research so when i went downtown i researched bank of america satisfaction of mortgages and you know thousands show up so i just grab a couple of them now i know what the basic template is they're all and they're all different by the way so it's you know it's not like you even have to be that close but whatever i mimic some of them order i had a notary stamp not hard to get you know you just you go in and you'll you go into three different you know office depots and you say hey i need a notary stamp and you give them the information and you come back four day or whatever a week later and they give it to you so i've got these notary stamps so i notarize the satisfactions i go downtown i file them boom the mortgages are gone keep in mind bank of america he he's still paying the mortgages they don't know that they've been satisfied in public records they're not notified so those are gone but it takes about a month or two for it to show up atlanta was that far behind i think it was fulton county they were just way behind so so we just kind of have to dick around for a while right so we're going on little vacations we're going to new orleans we're going to different places as scott cugno driving a car scott cugno we opened up several bank accounts we have multiple bank accounts and then we ended up going to vegas and we don't get we we do go to vegas but what happened was we're driving around and i remember thinking telling her i was like you know this is the problem like we have to get real i ids real driver's licenses i mean this is real but this is a real person too and he may stumble across it and and so what i did was i started running ads in magazines saying home loans available good credit bad credit no problem call now government loans you know government you know va fha fine you know whatever yeah call this number so people start calling and i'm getting their information one of the guys i got was michael eckert yeah i remember michael eckert poor michael eckert i actually actually legally changed his name to michael johnson at one point but at this point it was just michael eckert so i don't i wanted to see you know i'm bored i wanna see what the process is how much does it cost can is this possible let me see if i can change this guy's name it was it was fifteen hundred bucks i changed it without him ever showing up anywhere so you can figure driver's license in his name right i am him so he did show up he showed up at the lawyer's office right he so you know right so i'm so i do that i'm living in the house and we're driving along one day and i'm saying we gotta get real like these people that are calling like that one guy i i get his information but during the course of taking the application and i'm asking like these these government survey questions at the very end there's like twenty questions and i'm rambling them off and at some point he was like he said he he volunteered like i didn't know i never even asked anybody about criminal history and he just he ended up saying something well i do have a felony does that matter i mean he's like he was i mean it was a dui i've had a couple duis but i got my license back and that was part of the reason he had bad credit and it was like okay no nope it doesn't matter don't worry i'm thinking you're not getting a loan so this is i'm just taking your i'm just stealing from you sharing your information so i get all this information i'm i'm gathering it and so one of the things i said to becky while we are sitting at this stoplight is i'm like we got to get real people's real information and i said like for instance i said what if i steal somebody's identity i get a driver's license in his name four states from where he lives and he gets a dui i could get pulled over two years later and get arrested for a dui that he got in florida and she's like well what do you what do you what do you think are you thinking like like criminals or anything like like prisoners like mental patients like and i went i mean i don't and i looked over and there was a homeless guy holding a sign and i went like that guy and i remember she goes she's the hobo like i know who calls them hobos and she's like the hobo i said yes that guy i said hold on pulled over to a subway got out she went inside to get subway i walk across the street pulled out like twenty bucks and i said hey bro can i ask you some quick questions real quick he's like yeah what's up up and i go here's twenty bucks i said listen i said when was the last time you were gainfully employed he's like ah whatever ten years i'm like oh okay do you have do you have a criminal record he's like i've been arrested in misdemeanors like you know vagrancy and he names off some things you know drunk in public whatever and i was like are you on probation he goes i can't we can't i can't i can't do probation they don't give us probation they keep us for ninety days they release us like the the judge knows i can't do i'm not gonna show up for a probation i'm like okay do you have a driver's license he's like maybe i don't think so i think it's just i go is it skip dui he's like no i think it's just expired did you have a driver's license with you he's like no i got nothing i'm like okay well you know he told me he lived in like a tent in the woods and and so i give him like another twenty bucks ask them a few more questions and and then oh and i remember in the middle of it he said he goes well you're taking a survey or something and i went i remember thinking i nothing i s i go i kind of chuckled i go you get a lot of surveyors out here like that and he goes yes and sometimes and i was like really he goes yeah he said like the he said people from like you know halfway houses and what did he say social workers and stuff they'll come out and they'll you know they'll pass out stuff and they'll ask us questions and stuff and i'm like oh okay i was like i thought that's good to know so i go back i get grab becky and she's like oh did you give him money i said give him like forty or sixty bucks or something forget what and she was like yes what a waste of money that was good that was money well spent i said that guy's perfect i said that guy is he's got everything he has no way to be contacted he has no documentation on him i said he's he's not gonna drive a car he's not gonna get a dui he has an expired license i just have to get his license reinstated mhmm and i can be him so i went home i typed up a what i called a federal statistical survey form and i made a little thing i mean i went online i mean i'm always filling out federal documents as a mortgage broker so it looked identical i mean i had like this little like the the recycle symbol and it was like you know federal form seventeen oh seventeen you know and so i print out these forms i get a clip go buy a clip board i make a little salvation army id i pin it on me and i go out and i start doing surveys i start surveying homeless homeless people don't judge me bro i was in a bad spot i was in a bad spot i see the judgment i see the judgment let's maintain civility here like stay neutral stay neutral so these homeless guys i mean they have they have a social security number they have a a birth certificate i guess i mean they're a real person right they're a real person with they're just not using their real person yeah they're not actively engaging with the the economic system the financial systems they're not they're not employed they don't have housing all that kind of they they don't file taxes they don't so i one of the questions i even asked the guy at the end one of the last questions i said do you believe that you will be gainfully employed within the next two years mhmm every one of them said no no no so you know it was like okay they're not even they're not even trying and they all had alcohol problems or honestly the few of my talk to like was pretty clear i mean it takes literally five minutes less than five minutes to fill out the form and i filled it out for them of course but even filling it out and that brief just asking questions back and forth half of them you could tell you've got some mental illness like something's not right with you like these aren't guys that are gonna go out and get are going to get jobs they're not cleaning up so they were perfect for my purposes as horrible as i know that sounds so do you feel bad about this little small tangent no do i feel bad about it the homeless people in society are really it's a difficult life like dealing with mental illness dealing with drug addiction all that kind of stuff i mean listen being in prison and then the the kind of the people that are in prison that you know are are going to be homeless or have been homeless or the mental illness that i've dealt with in halfway house you know you know they they cause such problems like i don't know what the solution is other than just kind of keeping them fed maybe and keep them away from normal people you know so they don't cause crime or whatever i don't know about housing them in one area that seems like a mistake like there is absolutely no good solution to that problem none because it's not like hey if if we gave you a house or we gave you job training and we gave you this okay you might get five percent yeah ten but most of them are on the street because they've just messed up over and over and over again and they just kinda gave up but you know i guess we still have to remember that they're human beings and we mentioned off mike soft white underbelly and he highlights the humanity of people who've had a real difficult life he does it well he's mark leyda is amazing he's amazing and one of the things he had said was like these are he was like these are real people and he's like their stories he's like they have stories and they need you know but if you also talk to mark he'll tell you you can't just you can't give him money you can't like you can't like he's tried over every time he's reached out and tried to help these guys put them in apartments fed them got them back on their feet within six months they're back on they're back on the street and it just it just happens over and over and over again i mean i think the amount of money that would have to be dumped into correcting that problem i don't know i mean you can say well yeah but just you know you should do it because it's the right thing to do i don't know who's paying for it it's complicated but for your purpose they they have a security number they got twenty bucks they seem very happy there you are with a clipboard taking a survey right took a survey went home ordered their and they you know of course they give me everything name date of birth social security number mother's maiden name where they were born have they ever been in the armed services have they ever had a passport issued what states have they had identification and have they ever been arrested they they've been on probation have they ever claimed social security disability ssi i mean i had like seventeen questions and it absolutely answered everything what high school did you go to because high school transcripts are great for documentation a lot of times they'll ask you for high school you know can you get us a copy of your high school transcripts like that's good now and i'm a big believer in overkill so i mean i ordered a ton of stuff if i needed three things to get a driver's license in your name right you know i'd come in with like six cause what you do is you get in front of the the the guy at the dmv and you kind of fumble through like i got this what else do you need you know i know exactly what you need mhmm but you know they'll be like oh was that high school transfer yeah i'll take that and we're oh yeah voter's registration card give me that yeah that's you're perfect you're good sit down right over there that's it yeah who is by the way lurking in the shadows trying to catch you you've mentioned fbi secret service yeah i know you you mentioned i think i've heard you mentioned us marshals which is interesting cops in general the the police cia i guess cia is international only fbi is internal yeah okay well so who is when you're doing this who are you afraid of so by the time i've gotten to atlanta within four or five days the fbi raided my office i guess i kinda missed that back in florida back in florida when i left and drove to atlanta and left remember this fbi was gonna show up a few days later they were going to arrest me and they did they did they showed up like i left on a sunday night or something because for some reason my stupid thought i thought well they won't arrest me on the weekend like they don't work on the weekends so they came on like a whatever it was like a tuesday or wednesday or thursday like within a few days they come in the office they rate it they're looking for me but i'm gone nobody knows where i am and so now i'm i'm surveying the homeless guys and i've turned around and i'm ordering their documents and as their documents are showing up you know i'm i'm going to different states and getting ids so i'm going to florida so over over the course of this whole thing i've had twenty seven driver's licenses and like seven different states i've had two dozen passports because if you're going to get the driver's license in the guy's name you might as well get or an id even you might as well get a passport because a passport is not difficult to to get they don't fingerprint you mhmm you know all they look all they're doing is saying this is your id and were you born here and then they run a check and if it it comes back or it doesn't and back then you could do it expedited and i'd have it in like two weeks like now it takes like ninety days or sixty to ninety days to get one but and if you have multiple ideas for a single identity that's more proof right so wait what number did you say how many how many ids how many identities so i had well i've had over fifty identities but i've had twenty seven driver's licenses issued from state dmvs department of motor vehicles so like legitimately legitimately i walked into the dmv mhmm said hi my name's michael eckert and i just moved here about three weeks ago four weeks ago here's my lease and here i i i lost my i lost my driver's license bro mhmm like i don't know what i did with it i don't know i don't know what happened i don't i don't know and they're like it's alright what what do you have do you have i need a proof of residency while i have my lease oh okay i need a a primary okay here's my birth certificate okay and i need a a secondary my social security card but i also registered you know i i registered to vote my girlfriend made me vote immediately and she said i would need it you know oh yeah it's perfect you're you're good i don't even need that okay great stand over there pay that person they call your number two seven five you know forty five minutes later you go you pay your twenty five bucks you stand in front of the screen they take a picture you got a driver's license you walk out it's still warm it's beautiful it smells like pop plastic it's amazing and so i i'm opening up different different bank accounts in these guys' names and just what are you yeah sorry well what are you mostly doing with identities you're opening up different bank accounts right now are you doing a credit starting to establish credit or not some of them like i might order i might order secured credit cards so i can't get credit you know i'm building their credit like it's not helping me in any way i'm just sending out five hundred dollars to get a a capital one card or a american i'm sorry bank of america secured credit card whatever so i'm building their credits but not all of them only a few because i'm collect although i'm collecting them i'm also going to be moving soon i'm only here to get a few hundred thousand dollars and move i need some kind of a base so i don't wanna start getting credit cards and building up a a history in atlanta in anybody's name but i am getting driver's licenses in other states so i've been in like north carolina south carolina what's the primary method of income here when you move to a place south carolina how do you make a hundred thousand at this at this time well i'm in right now i'm living in this guy's house and i satisfied his loans the house is worth two hundred thousand got it so what happens is one day we go and we check public records remember i told you it takes months for it to show up and it shows up mhmm he's got no mortgages on the house so now i'm i turn around and i make a fake id in the name michael shanahan mhmm and i'm living in his house but i have no credit right there's no credit so i've got the the id i i've got a s a social security number and i order some secure credit cards in his name so if you pull that credit profile it does it shows up saying he's got some credit cards but it's they've only they're only a month or two old so i can't go to like bank of america i mean i could but i needed to get the money as quick as possible like i want to get out of atlanta so and at this point by the way there's multiple articles showing up in tampa so the st petersburg times is is writing multiple articles about me with your face with my picture yeah yeah but it's honestly it's it's pre i mean not pre internet but it's post internet but it's it's in its infancy like no nobody's it's not huge and and honestly it's a it's a it's a it's a local newspaper in tampa it's not that big of a deal like i'm not concerned about that so much at this point what i'm concerned about is getting a chunk of money and just moving on and kind of reestablishing ourselves in a better way where we're not living in a in a building that we're going to be committing fraud in with our house so but i'm living in this place i make a fake id and the name michael shanahan and i call up three secured or sorry three hard money lenders a hard money lender is a guy that lends his own money or other investors money on property kinda like a bank but he's lending his own money so he doesn't have to really meet the banking requirements and he char can charge a much higher interest rate these guys are charging twelve thirteen percent interest simple interest and they're only lending you a per a much lower percentage of the value of your home so they're not lending you ninety percent of the value they're lending you sixty five percent sixty percent so i call three of these guys they all come out to the house at different times and each one of them says i'll lend you a hundred thousand or just like one hundred and fifty thousand one hundred and fifty like they all lend roughly one hundred and fifty thousand so we schedule three separate closings none of them know about the other person so what i do is i close i close one loan on let's say monday and then one on tuesday and then went on whatever wednesday or thursday or or they may have all been the same day to be honest but i don't remember the point is i go to three separate title companies or real estate attorneys and we close and i get checks for you know after costs and everything the total ends up being roughly four hundred thousand so i've got four hundred thousand becky and i run another scam in tallahassee florida and we get like fifty grand and plus we the eighty the eighties dwindled down to close to nothing cause we we had gone on several vacations we went to like bermuda and i think we went to jamaica we actually stayed at the ritz in in jamaica so it was very nice you and becky so becky turned out to be pretty good in terms of scams on the road no she was useless she was she was she was horrible and and she just spent money all the time and by the what i realized too very quickly is she's bipolar so she's bipolar and she's absolutely you know insane she smokes pot all the time did that matter for you personally or did it actually affect the how good you were able to do these these particular scams it was that she was the type of person that would start an argument at one o'clock in the morning and scream at the top of her lungs and get the cops called okay so i can't have the police called i can't get taken downtown and fingerprinted i can't have the police showing up i don't know who's really who's looking we haven't had plastic surgery at this point we're still pulling money together so oh becky yeah becky's a problem and at some point i actually we send her to like a psychiatrist and they they give her they put her on zoloft and she takes it for like a month or two and then she stops taking it she's she she thought she was all better mhmm like you're not all better so can you give me a timeline here how long are you able to be on the road here successfully three years three years this is me this is the first few months years well so three years yeah what happens is we i we get that little chunk of money we put it deposited into these bank accounts and we start pulling out cash which works out fine cause we got a bunch of accounts and we're pulling out little amounts seven thousand five thousand eight thousand and you know i would cash checks against her accounts and they would call her to verify is there someone here trying to cash a check for nine thousand dollars you know can v you verify the payee and they go oh yeah that's scott cugno oh okay thank you and they cash the check you know these are new accounts so it looks odd but you know we're always i opened the account so what ends up happening is we're cashing them and i remember getting really frustrated cause it's just taking forever and i had gone into a bank one time and you know they have banks where that they they cash they actually cash like large checks like if you go into bank america and you try and cash a check for fifteen thousand dollars or twenty five thousand they probably won't do it they'll tell you we don't have that much cash on hand we don't this we don't that they have certain banks that do that so they told me where one of those was i went there i had a check for like twenty nine thousand that had been cut on a closing for michael shanahan remember i refinanced michael shanahan's and then i've got a check for twenty nine thousand that was issued to scott cugno so i'm sitting in the bank i go in there and i say i need to cash this and she says you're gonna talk to the manager i go okay she says go sit down over there i go sit down in the little glass cubicle he comes over and he says i see you're trying to cash this check and i was like right he goes why don't you just deposit in your own bank and i went my bank account my bank is a credit union or something and it's in like florida like they'll hold this thing for like two weeks like i need the money now i have people i need to pay he was like well i'm not sure and i was like well it's fine it's a it's a cashier's check like it's good and he goes no it's it's good it's good as you have the money and he's like yeah we have the money he said it's just odd hold on he goes back in the back and he comes back and he says where'd you get the check cashier's check i said it was a cashier's check it was drawn off of a closing for somebody property that i were doing the company i work for we're putting on an addition on okay that makes sense comes back why do you need cash i was like i i'm cashing guys checks that work for the company like there's a lot of these guys that are like mexican guys they give them a check they go to a check cashing company or they get charged five ten percent so i cashed them i'm like i don't under like what the check's good right like my and he's like yeah we're just trying to verify some stuff and he went yeah hold on and he leaves again and i remember my cell phone rang and i pick up the phone it's becky she said what are you doing what's taking so long i go the guy's being a jerk you don't wanna give me the money oh she's like oh my god get out of the bank get out of the bank and i went i can't get out of the bank the guy's got my id he's got my credit card my id and the check for twenty nine thousand like he's going to call the police if i just jump up and run and i go don't don't call me again i'll i'll let you know it'll be fine hang up the phone she calls back same conversation i'm bouncing all the walls i'm like i'm going crazy oh my god it'll be fine hang on the phone he comes back out and he goes he said i said hey so what's what's taking so long and he goes we're trying to get in touch with with michael shanahan to verify the check that was not good for me like i'm thinking right right okay okay and he walks away the phone rings it's becky what's what's going on i go he's they're trying to get ahold of michael channing she's oh my god oh my god and i'm like oh my god i remember thinking i should i shouldn't have left her the keys there's a good chance i run out of this place and she does she's not there but by the way when you're sitting there you're who scott you're scott i'm scott cugno and then the other guy calling my michael shanahan right they're saying they're trying to get in touch with michael shanahan so then the phone rings my cell rings again i look and it's not becky's yeah not becky so i pick up the phone i go hello and she says hi this is kim is it from suntrust bank is this michael shanahan so i'm like yes it is michael shanahan and she says there's a guy here he's trying to cash a check it's very large could you verify the payee and i go sure it's scott cugno he's try i said i believe the amount's twenty nine thousand dollars and she goes that's right thank you very much i appreciate it i said okay i said hey by the way how'd you get my number this is my cell number and she's like oh i'm sorry we called the title company and the title company gave us your phone number mhmm well i closed those loans that's my cell that's why if they'd looked in any other way i would've they could've gotten in touch with the real michael shanahan so i was like oh okay hang up the phone you're sitting you answered the phone from the bank while sitting in the bank as as my as scott as scott pretending to be my so i just right so i just verify the check yeah myself as matthew pretending to be scott as pretending to be mike right yeah so i wait there terrified still they come out about two minutes later the manager comes out plus a woman i'm assuming maybe that was kim she never said anything and he she walks out and she says and and he counts out the money twice twenty nine thousand twenty nine thousand and i stand up and i i mean just like i'm like shoving the money in my pockets like i'm trying to get out of there so quick i'm like hey i'm like okay cool like i'm thinking this whole thing is you know feels bad and i'm getting up and i'm so starting to walk out of the bank and he goes he said excuse me mr cugno and i said yes sir i turned around and he goes i'd like you know like you to know that i feel very apprehensive about this transaction and i go really what is it exactly and he goes i can't put my finger on it and i go it'll come to you and i turn around and i just bolt right out of there and so keep in mind a week or so later the secret service shows up did you cash a check for twenty nine thousand dollars so what's so funny is like that was one of the last checks we cashed so we ended up with like four hundred thousand was there a connection between the secret service and this guy no the deprehension so the fbi is looking for me kind of in in tampa yeah and they've put out a a a fugitive warrant for me which is how the us marshals got involved so us marshals tracked down fugitives yes federal fugitives they tracked down but everybody's after you you're on every list right i'm on the fbi's most wanted list at that point the secret service got involved once i leave atlanta so when becky and i pack up our bags and we leave atlanta the secret service got involved because of identity theft you know banking identity theft the secret service doesn't just do counterfeiting and protect the president they also protect the financial infrastructure of the united states and they especially have jurisdiction when identity theft is involved so identity theft plus bank fraud there that's when they they're they move yeah that's it that's their their their territory so they don't marshals are just fugitives us marshals just fugitives they don't do any they're all kind of work okay but they're all kind of working together yeah they yeah the the you know like the us marshals are like let's say an arm of all of the various law enforcement agencies federal agencies not the states the states have their own fugitive task force they're fugitive so when you leave atlanta basically everybody's after you everybody's after me did you know this at that time or did you just sense it or no but i mean now yeah you know we're every day you're looking at you're looking your name up every day like i'm not cause i'm just trying to get a bunch of money and and just blend in right things were not as interconnected at that time as they are now but they're starting to get interconnected but of course i have no idea how much i i barely go on the internet for anything you know dating mhmm that's the only thing on the internet you know i'd never been on facebook at this point facebook isn't even a isn't even out yet this is two thousand and six still were you trying to stay low yeah i i am i'm not a flashy person like i'm not driving you know like i didn't go out and buy a a red lamborghini you know i'm driving i'm driving forty dollars fifty thousand cars you know i've had some sports cars seventy eighty you know maybe that's one hundred and fifty thousand dollars sports car now but it's still not flashy it's not like it's bright red or yellow i mean these are it's always something you know nondescript and i'm living in areas that these cars are everywhere you know i go to nat so i ended up going to charlotte north carolina we rent an apartment we decided to run a scam in in south carolina so i go to columbia south carolina and in between this period of time we go to las vegas and i when we go to loss we go to las vegas to drop off a bunch of money to becky's son's father who's taking care of her son we drop off some money there we go and we start and and while we're there it's like hey there's homeless people here so we yeah so you're always you know usually i don't feel bad telling these stories you make me feel bad i'm sorry my judgment is showing no but you have to be collecting identities i guess to be constantly creating new identities so so i i got my survey forms so i go and you know we're we we go out and we're taking i'm taking service and i end up going up to this guy there's like two or three guys that are standing on like a bench or sitting on it next to a bench or something and i see him and i walk up and the guy one guy gets up and he comes over he is like hey what what do you need and i went i'm taking surveys for the salvation army to determine where we place our next homeless facility and the guy goes oh i'm not interested and they always said that and i said it pays twenty bucks cash right now it'll take you five minutes mhmm and they're like what you're twenty dollars cash right now i was like yeah like show them the cash they go okay yeah yeah what do you need name date of birth social security number so when i get to criminal record the guy he says criminal record he's like yeah i've been arrested he's i've been arrested like three four times for a prostitute he said but they're like misdemeanors and i went okay and it was like okay well prostitution i to me women get charged with prostitution you know men get pro charged with solicitation i went prostitution and he goes and he went he said yeah yeah he said i offered to blow an undercover cop for twenty bucks he said i that's what i thought you were coming up here for and i was like i was like no no bro i said okay and he's like yeah he said you know he goes he goes i mean he said i mean a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do you know and he made some comment or something i was like okay so i jot down the rest of it we're good i give him twenty bucks i get my car i leave we get back to north carolina i order all of his documents his name was gary sullivan i then go to south carolina when i go to south carolina i get a real estate agent we drive around for a day we look at like five or six houses i put five contract five owner owner financing contracts on five different houses so i get him he writes up five contracts all of them i'm asking for owner financing i'll put down ten percent i want owner financing two of them end up coming back and saying yes we'll do it i have two closings one of them is a house that's worth like two hundred and twenty five thousand i put down twenty five grand another one's a one hundred and ten thousand i put down eleven thousand so i buy these two houses i then satisfy the loans to on both the houses everything seems like it's going okay although becky's a lunatic at this point she's she's had so many she she won't take her medication she's had so many outbursts that and and we've had by this time we've had plastic surgery like she's gotten plastic surgery she's gotten a boob job she's gotten liposuction i mean all kinds of stuff so look way different like appearance changes or thinner better looking you know just tightened everything up i guess you know she was in her she'd had a she'd had a kid and she was thirty thirty three thirty four i don't know how she was twenty thirty two thirty three i don't know roughly my age so yeah i thought she looked you know she lost like fifteen pounds like she was not because of the surgery but just in general we're not we're just working out we're going mountain climbing we're you know riding bikes we're doing you know there's frauds not a full time job so you know we have plenty of time so we're we're goofing off and but she's also a lunatic you know she's getting the cops called she's able to go out and she's able to stay stoned twenty four hours a day she's she's going out with friends drinking i never leave the house you know even to this day i really barely ever leave the house i'm very much a homebody kind of person so like the the idea that i'm able to make my living doing youtube and i'd never have to leave my house mhmm i love that i don't ever go anywhere except for the gym and back home that's it so what happens is i i've actually moved her out of the my apartment like i had an apartment downtown thirty story building actually move her into another apartment she's that much of a lunatic we can't even be in the same place multiple times i've tried to leave her she's called me up and begged me to come back it's horrible so i ended up buying a couple houses in in columbia south carolina i satisfy the loans on the houses i've got an id not a driver's license but an id in the name of gary lee sullivan and i refinanced i refinanced those houses because keep in mind there was owner financing but they also had mortgages so there's something called a wraparound mortgage so these guys did wraparound mortgages so let's say you buy a house for two hundred two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and the bank lends you two hundred thousand mhmm and then you own or finance the house to me so we do a i give you fifty grand down but i'm not i'm not able to get a loan from the bank to pay off your mortgage so what we do is you do a wraparound mortgage so i'll pay you your mortgage and you pay the bank so there is a second mortgage on the property but it's called a wrap it's a wrap it's wrapped around your first that's legal yeah so i wouldn't lie to you so it's so there's these have wraparound mortgages so you're always selling i and you're good at it so i go i satisfy yeah the loans the owner finance loans the wraparound mortgages and i i satisfy the loans their the original loans that these people took out on their own mortgages mhmm one of them by the way i sat at you know you have to sign as the president of the bank right yeah so i sign it as c montgomery burns which is the aging tycoon in the the the guy that owns a power plant in the simpsons tv show yeah so i signed that and i notarize it mhmm which i thought was cute i actually wanted to sign all of them cartoon characters and becky was screaming her head off and wouldn't let me do it right like i wanted to do all the simpsons right but she wouldn't let me do it she's screaming and hollering so i ended up with you know nobody knows who see montgomery burns is so i sign it notarize it all of those are satisfied i then go to the multiple bank banks and i refinance start refinancing all these these properties multiple times so i'm applying for these loans and i'm getting the loans and i'm closing so i've got like five or six loans this one house the house is like two hundred and twenty five thousand i think it was like two thirty whatever i i i get i borrow like four or five loans on that house so i borrow like one hundred and ninety thousand dollars like five times so i've got like eight hundred thousand dollars and then i borrow another three or four hundred thousand on the other house the one the smaller one right so it ends up being like one point three million dollars it's actually like one point five million it was more but what happened with that was so keep in mind i you can only open up so many bank accounts in your name you can go to bank of america they'll open one then you go to suntrust they'll open one they're gonna ask they might even ask you did you did you open another bank account today because every time you do it there's an inquiry into something called check systems or accucheck mhmm and so then they go so then by the time you go to the third bank they'll say listen something's not right you've got multiple inquiries you know if you go to whatever mercantile bank there might be they might go okay we're gonna open one they're gonna need an explanation but you're not met you're not opening more than three by the third one they're gonna be like absolutely not something's wrong so you know i've got multiple identities but i can only open up so so many banks the other problem is that these these checks they'll only give you so much money on a refi usually after a hundred thousand they only want to let you walk away with let's say a hundred thousand dollars so one of the things i did was i would i would typically record another mortgage and have them pay that mortgage off so i had to open i opened a corporation to do that so i could then turn around and go open corporate bank accounts cause now it's not going off my information it's going off the corporation so i can open up multiple corporate bank accounts these corporations are fake or real no no i went to a real corporate bank attorney corporate attorney and had him open them i gave him whatever i gave him like fifteen hundred dollars two thousand dollars and he opened up a corporation for me gary sullivan yeah and i then turned around and i went and opened up multiple bank accounts in that in those that corporation's name how how are you keeping track of all this cause it's i don't need this so i'm i'm is it in your head or do you have good organization no no i have every single identity has its own file with with you know plastic inlays sleeves for their passports that's nice and organized yeah it's super overnight you open this i'm gary now right that's exactly what it is like you kind of go over boom boom boom boom you sit in your car for a minute you put it down you walk in well what happens is it went up to like one point five million and i'm pulling money out of the bank and then one day i got a phone call on gary sullivan's cell phone the guy it's a it's a lawyer they call up he says hey i'm lawyer with washington mutual we have an issue i said what's that he says we got a phone call from the title company one of the title companies that i was attempting to refinance one of the pieces of property with notice that i they had been sent they'd been sent a document that showed that i had purchased the property and i said i purchased it cash and i the documents that i purchased it cash and they got that and there was actually a mortgage on the property and so some somehow or another they they connected it and they called washington mutual and they said look there's an issue there's a fraud we have a fraudulent document here and he was like he said so we went and we looked and it turns out that we pulled public records and that there is a mortgage in front of us several mortgages in front of us so there's like three or four mortgages in front of me washington mutual you owe us and it wasn't that much it was like a hundred a hundred it was like like a hundred grand right like ninety five or a hundred and i said okay and he said so there's an issue here you've got a few mortgages in front of us and we're supposed to be a first mortgage and we're not supposed to be two mortgages behind or three and i was like okay sounds like sounds like an error not a big deal have you contacted law enforcement he said no i haven't i was hoping we could rectify this some other way i said you know what i think we can i'm going to have my lawyer call you back i'm going to go to his place right now give me about two hours no problem i immediately run jump in my car head towards south carolina call my corporate lawyer tell him look i need to talk to you here's what's going on i explain it to him he doesn't really understand he says this sounds pretty complicated i have my bit my wall partner is a criminal defense attorney i'm going to have i'm going to set up a meeting right now with all of us okay i get there forty five minutes then later i walk in the door i sit down he says what happened i said oh they said you know gary this is this is sudden sound right well what's what do you what happened i said okay so listen bought this house i bought a cash i then refinanced it i didn't buy a cash but i told them i bought it cash i refinanced it like four or five times within a day or two of each other and they were like how was that even possible i was like well i went to different title companies and i explained how i do it i said washington mutual just found out that they're in like second position or third position and or i said but they're probably they may be in fourth position you know they mail these things in so you never know and he was like oh my god he's like that's what do you want to do i said i want you to contact them and agree for them to not contact the authorities provided we pay them i pay them off he's do you have the money i said i do have the money i can go get the money right now he calls the lawyer they this is back when faxes right so they fax some documents back and forth they make they do a couple emails back and forth and they have a conversation i remember the lawyer started arguing because he wanted to charge me like yield spread and fees and stuff and i was like i was like what are you talking about like i'll pay it like so it ends up being a little over a hundred thousand and i'm like that's it so he's like okay and so he says okay that sounds good and so he said okay all you have to do is go get the check and he said bring it to a washington mutual branch tell them to call i said i'm not going into washington mutual branch bro i'll bring you the check so he calls them back he's not doing that and he's not okay i'm not i'll bring it here you guys take care of your side no problem okay hang up the phone and he turns to me he says okay well we have a problem he said we still have the problem of these other mortgages and i went right and he said and he goes okay well i said they don't know anything he said i know but gary he said what if they find out i said they find out that they're like in second and third and fourth place he's like right i said i i leave town and he went they they so they both laugh they gary you can't just leave town i they they have they have a copy of your driver's license they have your social security number they have your birth certificate i said they'll find you it's the fbi and i go you're assuming i'm gary sullivan wow you tell him and he they listened they looked at me and they went and i and i remember he said he goes we'll we'll cross that bridge when we get to it and i said right my immediate problem is getting rid of these people and he goes right right so i go get the check bring it back give it to them never call the fbi can't believe you got away with the with the with the washington mutual oh bro this is i mean these are all really close calls it seems like you no this is the close call mhmm i have two more close calls that my hands sweat thinking about it i walk in i walk into wachovia i just opened this account two months ago so it's a new account so whenever i would go in there and i'd say hey i need a seven thousand dollars six six thousand dollars anything over three thousand dollars they had to call to get permission right like auth author authorization so she was like okay i gotta go call i said no problem so she still the girl walks in the back i'm sitting there waiting all of a sudden a massive person reaches over my hand and grabs my wrist and somebody grabs it from the other one and they pull my hands behind my back these are two of possibly the largest law enforcement officers i've ever seen in my entire life and they're massive and they they handcuffed me and they say your mr sullivan you're being detained we're taking you into custody and you know putting you we're holding you until a detective gets here who are these guys is this us marshals or is this cops or what these are sheriff's deputies sheriff's deputies and as they walk me in the right as they walk me in the back they're calling me mister sullivan right they sit me down and by now i'm you know the secret service are looking for me they're they're calling me well they were calling us john and jane doe but now they figured out who we were and so now i'm on the secret services most wanted us i'm not like number one at that right like i probably was but i we just found out i was on like on that list so it's it's getting bad so they sit me down and i'm waiting and i remember thinking that the fbi was coming you know i don't really know at that point i couldn't tell you the difference between everybody and then five minutes go by and you know i'm sitting there going what is going on do you guys have any idea what's going on they're like we don't know we're just grunts we just do what we're told so suddenly the sky walks in he's probably in his early thirties maybe he walks in gray suit i think he looks like he's fbi he says hey i'm a detective with the i want to say richland county you know whatever sheriff's department or police department whatever and i was like oh okay and he says yeah listen we've got an issue wachovia wachovia wants this they want us to arrest you he said that they they're saying that you've got three mortgages on on your house and i go is that illegal and he looked at me and he went you know to be honest i don't know and i i and i distinctly remember thinking i'm walking out of here all i have to do is convince this guy i haven't done anything wrong he's already said he doesn't know so he gets on the phone with the head of wachovia fraud department and he's telling it saying this guy is running what's called a shotgun scam which is absolutely right and so what is the shot it's where you're you you close on so many loans simultaneously they can't catch it anyway they they start going back and forth and he's on the phone and he's like why did you close three loans and i said i you know what why are you pulling what i said i it's not illegal i have a first mortgage a second mortgage and a and a home equity line of credit that's perfectly legal and he goes and you could hear the guy yeah it's not they're all first mortgages and i said i read every one of those documents not one of them said they were first mortgages and they don't first mortgages don't say they're first mortgages it's the placement of the mortgage placement of the lien that determines is there first second or third so it's possible that i wouldn't have known it certainly that i could have read those documents and not known and he's like that's not true and he's screaming and so i go yeah listen and and he said well you're taking out all cash why are you taking out all cash i said well i mean i don't know if this sounds i don't know if this might be illegal i said i don't know i said i mean i worked for for a i worked for a labor company labor on demand i pull out my business card you can call so i'm like i work for labor on demand and i said we we hire a lot of guys that like they don't have bank accounts so the company pays them and then i'll usually i'll pull out money and i'll i'll cash their checks because they get charged like ten percent of these check cashing companies i feel bad i know the checks are good so i just deposit them i mean i don't think that i said but i don't i don't know if that's illegal i don't know if that's illegal like if if and he's like no no no that's fine it's it's that's that's a decent thing to do it's not that's fine i'm like oh okay so we're so he's talking to the guy and you know what covey is screaming hollering he says he's doing that you know he's going back and forth back and forth so we're going back and forth back and i'm just derailing everything this guy says and at one point he says he's screaming he's committing fraud we want him arrested and he's like i don't know what to charge him with and he's like you know he he's saying these aren't you know how did you know how did you he's like hey look how did you even do this what i go look i didn't do this i said i came to wachovia i met with a loan officer i said i need a first mortgage i need to pull out like a hundred thousand dollars i wanna start buying houses he goes that's right you own another house here too don't you i said i do i said i'm we're putting a new roof on it we're gonna build an addition we're putting in a pool i'm buying one right down the street from that one i said so i'm i'm obviously i'm pulling out money mhmm i said so i told him i need a hundred thousand dollars they said that's fine we get we they said they could only get me a hundred thousand dollars out for something about fannie mae guidelines which is true and i and i said so then she said i i can get you i can send you to a friend of mine who's a loan officer she can get you a second mortgage which she did i said then i told her she could only get me a hundred thousand or so one hundred and ninety thousand in the other and she said you should get an an equity line of credit if you're gonna be doing like you know renovating properties so she sent me to somebody and they got me an equity line of credit i said i said i you know i haven't committed fraud i said i wouldn't know how to commit fraud if you told me i said what sounds more reasonable a guy that works for a labor company ripped off a bunch of banks for over half a million dollars i said or some loan officers got together and did something illegal i said there's a problem at the bank and he says i think you've got a problem at the bank and this guy goes nuts and while he's screaming he needs to be arrested this is fraud my loan officers have not done anything illegal they wouldn't do that he says look at his id his id is fake his id starts with zero zero zero south carolina id start with zero zero zero this guy's in california he has no idea so when he says that he go he the the detective looks paul looks at my id and he goes listen he said this is a real id i ran this guy through ncic he said this is gary sullivan and i and i looked at him i go now i'm not gary sullivan i go come on on bro what are we doing here and he goes i know gary i know and he says i'm gonna take him downtown i'm going to talk to my whatever lieutenant whoever captain and i'm gonna fill out a police report and i'll let you know and he hangs up yeah i get up they've taken the handcuffs off i stand up as we're walking out with the detectives as we're all kinda walking out he goes hey you have an id do you have a driver's license mhmm and i went i do but it's in like nevada mhmm and he goes oh that's right he goes you're from vegas and he looks at the two deputies and they all kinda grin and i think he ran me through ncic which means he ran a statewide criminal database which means he thinks i've been arrested three times for in vegas right i listen i'm humiliated i was just like and the grin told me and i was just like oh man and so one of the cops goes here give me the id takes the id he goes i'll check and see because i have to follow him back in my car so he goes and by the way my car is is in the name michael eckert so michael eckert he doesn't have a photograph of michael eckert right because you can't pull up photographs from other states so he doesn't have a photograph but he knows that's not my car and he asked me whose car are you driving i said oh that's my boss michael eckert and i said that's my boss and he goes oh michael eckert i said yeah exactly and he's like and i'm like oh my god so i'm thinking he knows michael eckert knows it's registered in north carolina knows the address which is where i was currently living that's a problem so is i have no idea if this homeless guy has a driver's license in nevada i don't know he had nothing on him he comes back and he goes he's he is does he have a valid license he goes yeah it's valid and he hands it to him or he hands me the id and he says he said he he goes it's valid and he looked at me he goes yeah well he said it it says he's like he says he's five foot eleven mhmm like it was like five ten five eleven i'm clearly not five ten or five eleven and they all look at me and i go fellas with a good pair of shoes like that and they all go follow us gary i follow them back to the police station becky is calling me mhmm on the phone screaming her head off now i'd always told becky if i ever get arrested immediately go get me a lawyer the lawyer will be able to get me out on bond cause it'll i'll be arrested for something stupid i said it will be something like trying to cash a check you know a fake check or you know use of somebody said it won't be the all my ids are real so it won't be for for a fake id so my id my id won't be in question and most most police departments and sheriffs at that time did not run your fingerprints through aphis so they didn't because they charge them for that so they don't typically do it unless your identity is in question mine wouldn't be i have a valid driver's license or a valid id in that state so i go back she's screaming she's like oh my god you don't understand i just checked the i just checked the just checked the internet the website you are number one on the secret services most wanted list and i was like i got bigger problems right now they just held me in the bank i'm following them right now i know and she was like yeah get on the get on the interstate go go i cannot go the detective's in front of me the cops are behind me they're escorting me to the police listen she's like oh my god run run i go look i'm not a nascar driver like i'm driving it's a it's a sports car but it's not going to outrun a radio or a helicopter like i am not that's not going to happen i know it looks it seems nice i'm not that guy so i was like i can't i said look you don't understand i was in handcuffs thirty minutes ago i just talked my way out of them i'm gonna get out of this mhmm and i and i said the worst that happens is i'll be arrested as gary sullivan you can get me a plea or you can get me a an attorney he can get me out and she goes i'm not getting you an attorney i'm not getting you out on bond i'm not risking everything i've got for you because she has all the money we've got seven eight hundred thousand dollars at this point mhmm so oh and by the way she's not even in north carolina at this point she's relocated to houston texas because when this scam broke fell apart we were gonna move to texas so we we were already moving there so but by the way just a small tangent where do you store money in situations like this that like when you talk about eight hundred thousand do you have to keep moving accounts to make sure it's not accessible by there's about fbi well there's about six or seven hundred thousand accounts but keep them on i'm getting that out in cash like there's no bitcoin there's no none of that stuff exists so my you know i i probably should have bought diamonds or bought gold or bought like i don't know any of that all i could think of is go in slowly be patient don't drain the accounts you know fluctuate them like i was writing getting cashier's checks from one account to another so the balances were doing this you know they weren't just going they were doing this and then one day boom they're gone okay got it so so we got out like whatever we got we've gotten out like six or seven hundred thousand there's still like six or seven hundred thousand in the bank but i i'm not going back i'm done i actually to be honest with you so well look i go in so i go into the police station and what first she says if you go in the police station i'm done if you get arrested and you're done i said well i better not get arrested i hang up the phone the cops standing behind my car mhmm get out i go in the police station i walk in i fill out the police report he tells me i gotta talk to my captain real quick can you wait he couldn't leave me in his cubicle he goes can you wait in the hallway i can't leave you in the i said no no problem so i go and i wait in the hallway in the hallway or a whole wall full of on the corkboard wanted posters black and white black and white like you know car thief you know rapists murderer secret services most wanted and i'm on the on my faces right there i'm like holy jesus and you know everything in may told me run bro just just fucking holler at right now right now just go you're you've your luck's run out not that i even thought he was gonna there were so many i didn't think he was gonna see it mhmm but it it just everything in me just said run the the problem is if you've ever been a plea into a police station you're not getting out of it do you understand the there's a lot of cops around well not just that but they buzz you in yeah you get in the elevator you have to punch in a code right you have to punch in a code to get back out of the elevator you have to punch in a code to get into the next door there's like i mean it it was it's impossible like i'm never i'm not gonna get in the elevator so guy comes back up to the cop comes back up he said hey gary appreciate it no problem my captain said we're good we're going to wait for a phone call from the no way the f the district attorney called already they're looking into it i'm going to go ahead and let you go i go downstairs he walks me out to my car he said look do me a favor he's like we we do have some serious questions at this point like the district attorney said there's there's some some things up he said i said not with me and he said well just do me a favor he goes don't don't leave town i said bro i own two houses here i'm not going anywhere i said that i'm telling you right now i said walk over they they fucked up and he's like i believe you i believe you seven i worry he said whatever he's like i hope you i hope they were right i'm sure you're right okay so i get in my car i leave i go to two more banks pull out more money but at one point i go into a bank and like two of the cashiers practically slam into each other trying to get to the phone and i could tell something's up i go no no no no no something's up so i back i get my car back out one of them even kinda runs out and looks tag number you know so i drive i get on the interstate i go you know becky of course she's you know i'm sorry i love you i would have never done that i was just scared i understand i go becky sounds like a handful oh my god so i go all the way back to charlotte i pack up my apartment i drive all the way to houston with my entire apartment packed up by the way in a u haul like the next day the next morning we pack she's got people there packing it up movers we pack it up i drive the u haul all the way to houston it takes a couple of days i unload it into we have some guys unload it into a into a storage unit cause i'm going to stay with becky until a five mile apartment as we're driving around the neighborhood super nice she's living in like whatever like unlike that twentieth floor or something of some huge high rise great apartment we drive by and i go oh stop the car and i i want to get out on it it was one of those cone things where there's flyers for the house for an up house i jump out and i get the flyer and and she's like what are you doing i go i just want to you know i look look at the flyer and she says i don't want to do a scam here i want to live here this place is nice i love it here and i went right i understand i said i'm not gonna i said no but i have a fine an apartment mhmm and she is oh you just i'm just so disgusting you can't stand to spend even a couple weeks with me you just and she goes just ballistic she's screaming at the top of her lungs and i know she's going to get me caught she's never going to get me out right she's already told me that so we go back to the apartment we go upstairs i was so scared of this this chick bro i was so scared i remember i was going up in the elevator and this girl gets on this clearly a stripper i mean drop dead just but wearing stripper clothes yep and i'm staring like and as soon as she got on becky gave me that where the face and i'm like this i'm like staring in the corner and never look at the girl and i remember when we get off the elevator ping it opens i bolt off it becky bolts bolts office and i re off the elevator and i remember she squeals i bet you just love to fuck that tramp and the girl has the elevator doors are closing she goes hey i thought that was funny so i go to the apartment yeah we we have a screaming match kind of tell her i want to split up the money she tells me she's not going to give me split the money right because she said you can go somewhere else and do this again you'll have a million dollars in six months you know i have to live off this money did she threaten you oh she threatened the but it was it was funny too cause the conversation back and forth i remember saying no i won't happen and she goes and she said i'll give you ten thousand dollars i said you're out of your mind i said i said i'm telling right now you come up with some reason but i'll take all of it and she said what'd she say i said i'll take all of it she was in what escape in that u haul they're going to she was the cops are going to be looking for in five minutes and i went i just remember thinking oh wow and keep in mind all of my ids everything are in the storage unit that she has a key to like i'm not getting those it's over i got an id right now that says my name is michael eckert yeah i am driving a i i i got i'm driving a u haul van yeah sounds like she has a lot of negotiation leverage right so we start arguing back and forth and she says a hundred thousand dollars yeah i'll give you a hundred thousand i said i'll take it she counts it out counts out the hundred thousand later when i recount it it wasn't even a hundred it was like ninety eight thousand that's fine that's fine so but you know we've got them all marked you know two thousand five thousand six thousand she's like two thousand five thousand that's tall that's it she ends up stiffing me that's fine it's not my money so i i take it i end up you know i take it i leave and as i'm leaving she'd always called me before on the phone and begged and pleaded and cried i messed up please give me a chance i'm sorry i'm i'll i'll take my medication i'm sorry i thought it was better i thought it was okay and i remember walking out i put my cell phone on the counter and just walked out went downstairs got in the truck and drove and drove when i got to louisiana i stopped at baton rouge and got a i mean at some point i stopped and i got like i think i got a room or something at one point i know i stopped so you drove without a plan essentially i drove back to charlotte to get my car got it so i can't be driving i can drive in this truck so i stopped at baton rouge at one point and got a cell phone you know like a burner phone like a verizon virgin mobile or something one of those little phones so i bought one i call a few people at home back home call my mom she's in tears crying my dad's yelling in the background i call what's your mom just a small tangent what what did your mom and dad say you know anything stand out to you no my dad you know you you know well i hope you're happy you know your mother every time someone mentions your name your mother cries which is funny to me cause like growing up like he was they were concerned about her crying you know so it was like since when did you care you know and i just so i mean my dad's like he's an alcoholic you know he's been sober for two years a month and a half drunk drunken binge or drinking sorry drinking binge and then sober for six months and then did it again and sober you know it just went back and forth and in and out of alcohol you know drug programs but like i said it worked for state farm and state farm he was a top selling manager and so what they would do is they they'd put them into a thirty day program and and and i mean like like he has to stay there and they had they were the only ones that had that kind of control cause they're like you're going to do this and you're going to pass it or we're firing you you know he he made a lot of money and he made a lot of money for state farm and he hired he hired and trained a ton of agents and he had one of the top performing agencies so he was worth a lot to them and but so i i end up what ends up happening is i'm driving through i get that phone that i was telling you about and i call so i call talk to my mom she's you know she's crying she's like i love you so much you know i just wanna make sure you're you're safe i end up calling susan barker which was one of the brokers that worked for me at the time call her and i say hey what's going on how's it she's like oh matt and you know what's going on fbi is everywhere like they're they're they've been talking to everybody they you know and this has been it's like a year and a half at this point and she's like it's not you know they're they come around every once in a while everybody's gone in everybody's cooperating everybody's talking everybody's blaming you including her and and so as we're talking she said look i i've the main fbi agent on the case she told me if i ever spoke with you to have you call her and i was like yeah i'm good so she goes her name is candace and she she wants you to call her she goes at least call her for god's sakes maybe you could just turn yourself in maybe maybe you can negotiate just like a couple years like because they're if they're not gonna catch you then then maybe turn yourself in maybe it'll help at least hear her out and i was like okay all right you're right hang up the phone i call candace she picks up the phone i go hey i said she goes who's this and i go this is matt cox yeah and she goes hey hello mister cox how are you and i go i'm i'm doing okay how's it going i understand you wanna talk to me she goes i do i said what can i do for you she goes you can turn yourself in i go well that's not gonna happen i said what else do you need and she said i think that you should think about turning yourself in i said why well what am i looking at she said well that's not how it works w way it works is you turn yourself in and you know we take that into consideration i said no no no no i said that's not good enough i said i'm not not stupid enough to turn myself in and hope for the best so she says well let's talk about this and i said well what am i looking at and she's i don't really know i i can't you know really i can't tell you that and she's i said well then we don't really have anything to talk about she goes well wait a second she said let me hold on let me call the us attorney maybe we can work something out so she calls us she she so i said okay i'll call you back and she said we'll give you your phone number i'll call you and i went no no no i said i'll i'll call you i said i'm going to hang up the phone i'm going to turn the phone off i said for all i know you're triangulating this phone call right now or something you know and she says oh give me a break she says you're not that important something you know and she was oh give me a break she's you're not that important and i i remember thinking who do you think you are like like she like right like you're you're just some little fraudster guy running around you know like you're not a terrorist mhmm you know like and i almost i almost was like oh okay here's my number which she probably already had mhmm but i almost like was like okay i'll wait for your call and left my phone i said no you know what i said i'm gonna hang up the phone i'm gonna turn it off anyway and i'll i'll call you back she's alright whatever i hang up i turn off the phone it turns out i found out later when i ordered the freedom of information act she actually immediately called the us marshals and they immediately called took the phone number and tracked back the phone and immediately had two marshals from baton rouge or go immediately to the place where i had been mhmm damn oh listen yeah i mean they work fast yeah she's and she's good too not just that i i made the initial calls sitting there in that where i went and bought the phone it was like a gas station there was also like a subway station i had ordered like a subway i was eating a subway playing on my computer program the phone and making phone calls so by the time i talked to her and they're they're driving i by that point i walked and gotten into my vehicle and i leave but you know who knows i don't know if they showed up thirty minutes late i don't know like i could have hung out like oh i'm just gonna finish my food could have shown up so i go i call her back an hour or two later she says listen you know first time he wasn't hadn't got back with her then he did then he came back he said seven years he's got to turn himself in here so okay seven years that's that seems like a lot and i was like seven year and that's seven years for for i goes that and i kept saying is that seven years for everything and she goes yeah that's for everything i was like that's everything like everything in that happened like in atlanta like in some stuff that you don't know about she said look what's important is you turn yourself in in tampa and i was like okay well i'm closer to atlanta why wouldn't i turn myself in in atlanta and she's like look you you know you don't want to do that you don't want to do that well cause that would have been the secret service would have gotten credit if i'd walked in there right so you know and i don't know anything about rivalries and how they work at that time i do now but so we go back and forth back and forth and i continually ask ask her does that include atlanta and everything and at some point i realized like oh she's just not answering and so finally i said listen you keep dodging this question and she said all i can speak for is tampa so if you come back to tampa and you cooperate against everyone seven years and she's telling me she wants me to cooperate against my ex wife and i'm like i'm not gonna do that i said my ex wife didn't do anything she doesn't know anything she didn't do anything she's never you know that's not what i heard and then she's going on and on and i was like no no i was like oh wow i was like so that's just for and she's like that's right i said alright we're done she's no wait i can call the atlanta us attorney i said nah lady i wouldn't believe you if you told me water was wet i don't trust you and i hung up the phone threw it out the window and i ended up going to charlotte drop off the u haul van go to my don't know i would have actually brought it back to the dealer it's not like i abandoned i brought it back so i i bring it back i go to my old apartment in downtown charlotte and i remember thinking i would be okay and i know by this point that they they knew michael eckert's name they had the address in charlotte so i know they they by this point has been five six days so i know they've tracked him back there so i figured if i could get my car up i'm fine so i go into the apartment complex and it you know it's like five four of those four or five six story apartment you know those are parking things that stack up so i go into this you know underground it's not underground but whatever this parking garage thing so i go in i'm on like the third floor or something i i look at my car you know and i i get my car and i remember as soon as i drove out of the the parking garage i was like i'm good so i can go ahead and pull across the street and stop at starbucks so i stop at starbucks i walk into starbucks i order starbucks i'm standing there waiting for the barista i look over and it's two people from the apartment complex staring at me like that's what i'm like and there's they're whispering and pointing and none and i remember thinking this is like the fifth of the month i hadn't paid my rent mhmm hadn't been there so i thought that that makes sense maybe they did they like i i'm picturing an eviction notice or a three day notice on my door or something and i'm like okay and then one of them bolts out the back the woman the there's a guy and a girl the woman runs out the back he's standing there staring at me i get my my my my venti vanilla latte right i get my little fruit i get my fruit fruit drink yeah so i get my fruit fruit drink i i walk out i get into the car he follows me yeah get in the car i set everything up i put my seat belt on i'm okay he's standing there staring at me you know i'm thinking something's wrong like what's up and all and i'm i checked to see there's no traffic i'm good i'm about to about to leave and he starts screaming he's right here he's right here i look in the rear view mirror there's two guys running towards the back of my car i punch it and i take off sounds dramatic wasn't that dramatic i'd already there was no cars i knew there was no cars already pulling out you know it wasn't like a tj hooker where i jumped over the slit across the the hood and you know they didn't catch the car and hang on the back but you know i so they're running and i boom hit it did you spill the coffee here no because it was one of those little things it was actually nice but but it just you're making it sound like you're pretty calm what you're panicking here i was terrified yeah terrified so you're you're under under fear you're still operate yeah i operate like i it's funny you say that because the the secret service when they talk to these guys they all the people that they spoke with said the same thing over and over again the guy was a professional he never seemed upset he never seemed agitated he always he was never in a hurry yeah he you know like but most of the time i wasn't because i you know it wasn't until the police got involved or should the law and federal law enforcement got involved that i i started really you know getting anxious so at that point i dry i take off i drive about a mile down the road who are the two guys by the way was it i thought it was fbi i ordered the freedom of information act when i got to prison at some point you know in the future and it was it was us marshals right so it sounds pretty dramatic to me you as marshals running towards your car you pull it i mean i mean you know but it's it's hard not to tell it like it's dramatic i understand but it was there's not much traffic it was okay yeah it's not like their you know their fingers were at the back of the car they're holding on you know but it was yeah if i had waited an an extra twenty seconds yeah they would have been on my car they would have been right there at the door would you consider giving up there or no no all i could think of was hall listen my my instinct is get out is go go go go go go you're already on the run i'm already in trouble it's not like they're going to be they're going to they're going to add anything although to be honest you know it only got worse because at that point actually at that point i drive down the road i stop at a homeless facility i survey three guys i'm a mile down the road like looking back on i think what were you thinking but there were three three homeless guys that were in their early thirties and they were they were all caucasian that's hard to find so trust me i've looked spent hours before track of finding these guys so that's like the the the the the golden thing you're looking for is white guys in their thirties right cause that's why i was in my thirties that's why i was an old man like i am now so i i survey them i drive straight to nashville yeah get to nashville drive through an area called green hills well at first like when i got to nashville i stayed the night and the next day i went into i'm going to say up a ups store it was actually a kinko's there used to be they used to be called kinko's but do i go in and you remember kinko's oh yeah they got bought by fedex i feel like oh is it fedex okay then it was a fedex store so i go in there and you give them like fifty bucks or something or twenty bucks or something they'd give you like a hundred business cards so i get a i go get a a burn a phone number a burner phone i go in there i make up oh i call and get a phone number from hq the local hq i come up with a name manufactured funding group i've got two phone numbers i get business cards made with a name one of the guys' names that i surveyed was his actual name was joseph marion carter jr i went by carter so i get business cards made of joseph carter i then drive through green hills took them like an hour to get the card so i'm driving through green hills planning on going to an apartment but i'm still i don't have an id i don't have anything like i'm wondering how what am i going to do how am i going to get a place to stay i'm going to stay in a hotel like what am i doing i'm i'm using an an id that the cops are looking for so as i'm driving trying to find this big apartment complex there's a guy putting a sign in the front yard of like a townhouse cause several townhouses and i probably in his sixties i pull in jump out of the car and i said hey is that this for rent he said yes it is i said oh okay yeah can i see it sure i go in check it out come back downstairs it's perfect i said listen i you know i worked for a company you know manufactured funding group boom ham thing i said i i've been in in europe for the last i forget what i said i said england i saw a little town outside of london in you know whatever dexter you know london for the past five years i don't really have any any credit but i said i i can put down a double the security deposit or you know whatever you need here's my business card he looked at me and he looked at my car and he goes you look like an honest young man he said i'll i'll take the first month's rent and and deposit and they said no go get a lease right now and i said okay and i said oh okay filled out a lease right then gave me the keys like nice like very trusting in in in that town well that oh yeah but there must have been also something about you or you you're just i mean i don't got a nice car look i know what you're you're gonna get a lot of comments that say white privilege but that's what that's what you're i think the charisma has something to do with it yeah well i so he gave i appreciate that so he gave me the keys listen i ordered all of all of joseph carter's vital information right like all of his birth certificate social security card everything that night from like a kinko's or some of the i forget where but from one of these places i went online you could go online back then right like there wasn't wifi everywhere so i ordered this stuff it shows up a couple of days later i take that information i go and i get an a driver's license what about within like seven or eight days i've got a driver's license in his name i get in that car michael eckert's car i drive it all the way back to nashville i leave it in long term parking get on a plane fly back to nashville go in and buy myself a brand new car it was a brand new it was a couple of years old but from like carmax when it within two weeks i am completely one hundred percent set up i start dating for three four months that gets really boring and where where where again in nashville you said nashville okay got it so i start dating a bunch of chicks and then i end up meeting this one girl by the way are you lonely here cause you're on the run and listen being on i'm telling you right now being on the run was the best part of my life really everybody you know all these guys say it was horrible and i was always so concerned and looking over my shoulder and it wasn't i wasn't keep in mind i i've gotten i've gotten five or six traffic tickets while on the run i went to traffic school as someone else i got so many traffic tickets in his name i went to traffic school as him like if i got pulled over like i'm not concerned so your confidence just was and i'm i'm driving on top here driving a vehicle in the name of the driver's license that i have that was issued by that state yeah full coverage insurance i'm not an idiot i'm not driving around a stolen car with a broken taillight and a body in the trunk like i'm covered like i'm not concerned about the local cops plus you're going to starbucks sipping your coffee and driving away from us marshall right right that was you could start believing that it's impossible to catch you you that is exactly what it is it's it's every time i just kept getting more and more emboldened more and more cocky arrogant like they're not gonna catch i'm too good you know which is great until they catch you yeah and so i i meet a girl named amanda gardner well what i end up doing is let's keep on i've only got a hundred thousand or so so i go and i start buying houses in the area in this area called jc napier next to it it's just close to downtown and i buy these houses and i start reco i buy them for like sixty seventy thousand and i record the sales at two ten one ninety one two two zero five that sort of thing same thing and i refinance the house as i start pulling out money i meet this girl amanda gardner she w we hit it off within a few months she's moved in to we move into a house in that area i renovate a house we move in there i borrow three and a half million dollars and i'm buying houses now i'm buying houses recording the value i started all over you know i borrow like whatever three and a half million dollars i meet amanda we move in together we're we're we're do you tell her do you tell her about she's kind of you know what she knew was that you know it's it's it's odd right i have no photographs everything i own is brand new she's like you don't there's nothing in this house that's more than four months old so six months old you have no photographs you have no internet presence you have no you know it's every stick of clothing is brand new you don't have old pairs of jeans dan do you tell our stories about the past of any like is there a fabricated the initial initially there was a fabricated version that i owned i owned a mortgage company my typical story was like i owned a mortgage company and i got bought out by household bank started doing very well i got bought out by household bank i have a note non compete clause i got you know i ended up with like half a million dollars after paying off all my bills and just decided to kind of travel around the us and now i'm here i'm gonna start renovating houses but that you know you don't call home nobody calls you your family doesn't call you you tell stories about your mom your dad your brother your sister friends i don't know any of these friends never seen any of these friends they never call you they never you know it's just like it's like ah shit so at some point i basically just said to her look i'm listen at one point i had to have a check cut i refinanced the house right and i had like i wanna say i'm going to say something like it might've been thirty thousand but let's say twenty thousand i had a twenty thousand dollars check cut to amanda gardner cause you have to have these checks you can't have them cut to me so i would say hey there's a second mortgage on there and i provide a second mortgage or i provide you know i provide different things and i knew i i need names of people to cut these things too so i had a check cut for whatever so i remember we're at dinner one night this is before she really knows who i am and i said hey i said oh and she goes oh did you had to refinance she was how'd that thing go you're refinanced i go oh thank god you said that boom i said i need you to deposit this get a check for twenty thousand she's like i can i can depo i can go tomorrow and and i can deposit it and i and i'm like no no no i said i'm like look it's fine just deposit so i can get as soon as it clears i'll i'll i'll get you a cashier's check i was like no just deposit it and keep it in your bank it's fine so she's like what is going on you know and so we have this conversation and i tell her look people are looking for me who law enforcement which ones all of them you know and she's like that doesn't even work for what i go mostly bank fraud and she's like well how are they not finding you i mean everybody you know people know you like you know your general contractor which i met four months before this guy six months before this for two months before you know she's like so

name is not you know my name is not it's not joseph carter and what is your what is your name i go look you know it's it's you don't need don't even worry about it this is what's happening this is where i'm at this has been months into the relationship i mean this is or i'd say maybe a month or two in but you know she was just too inquisitive and oh i know what it was she found like dollars forty thousand in cash in my freezer one night that was another thing that happened she went to get a popsicle and she opened up the the flip to get a a popsicle and she opened the wrong one and there was all cash and she was like like you know i had the other day you know in this conversation she's gonna be the other day i opened up the popsicle box and there's cash and i'm like so i kind of explain it but i had a feeling she's not gonna she's gonna be okay with this you know so she was okay she was okay with it like i mean to me that's just a fascinating conversation to have like it it was a great conversation because because oftentimes in relationships you learn about each other and you find out new things and here you find out that's a doozy yeah it's a good one to find out the name you're using is not your real name and the secret service the fbi and everybody else are looking for you yeah and you're like to be honest you're not a violent criminal so it's like and i you know you know but she didn't know my name like she was like she and i told her i said look if you start digging if you find out my name like i'll leave like there's certain things that catch you staying in contact with people that you know that's how you get caught you know going back to see people that's how you get caught you know telling people who you are that's how you get caught and i was like so i'm joseph carter everything's fine and she was like okay you know and keep in mind too this girl do you you oh your car is broken or your car's not doing well take it and trade it in we'll go get you another car we'll go get you a you know an infiniti you know fx or whatever you know a fifty five thousand sixty thousand dollar vehicle she's driving the equivalent of a beat up old nova you know i mean it's you wanna go on vacation we'll go on vacation you wanna do this you wanna do that so you know we're buying houses i i'm we're we're renovating houses we're we're building brand new houses we're buying lots like she's like in the middle of this like holy jesus there's hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank in our bank account her bank account i open up a corporation in her name she's opening a bank account she's got web there's websites it's it's a lot and while this is happening we start seeing a friend of hers so this other girl comes in the picture her name's trina and trina is semi lesbian so is it is it like a sexual thing or actual relationship no it's more like she's coming over a couple of times a week okay so we've got a ton of tons going on and i put this so while this is happening i i ended up coming out in like several magazines so i'm thinking this whole thing's dying down but it's not dying down because now i just got caught and handcuffed in a bank walked out of the police station outran marshalls although then that part the marshall thing never was never in the papers but the getting caught and handcuffed in the bank when that hit the papers that's everywhere bro that's huge you know suddenly chicago tribunes running a series of fugitives i'm in bloomberg business week they run an articles or article called you know sharks in the housing pool then you've got a fortune magazine comes out with the thing because by now guess what becky's been caught oh becky becky oh becky is she in houston or whatever in houston got caught and did she but gangster bro like the way she here's the thing hey hey there you go no oh no she told on me immediately oh she did yeah oh no it's fine she did the right thing so here here's what's funny about that about that she here's what she says loyalty is everything in this world my friend that you and i disagree on i just took off i just took off still on her and left her with with with listen with like six or like five or six hundred thousand dollars is what i left her with it's not it's not all about money matthew it's also about just like you know ride or die there's a meaning to that my god i'm sorry go ahead so she told she said everything well here's what what when i say gangster when she gets caught yeah they come in she's in the middle of beauty school she's paid for beauty school she's going through beauty school she's going to open like a salon or something so she's in there cutting hair in a class you know on a mannequin and all of a sudden like five or six secret service agents come in guns drawn screaming get on the ground get on the ground she said everybody dropped the ground she said i'm sitting there with scissors going you know they grab her they handcuff her they bring her in and the whole time now at that point she was rebecca well she was yeah her name was rebecca hickey she went by becca she was so she's rebecca hickey which is you know it's she's got a texas driver's license the whole thing and they're screaming at her and they she they put her in the car and they're driving the whole way she goes the guy the secret service agent told me forty five minutes she's telling us you're losing your job bro you're losing i mean he's he's like i i couldn't believe it like we've we've got pictures of her yeah we're like this is you she's like that's not me are you insane look at that chubby little thing yeah would not budge till they actually put her hand on the scanner and she goes okay i'm rebecca halk what do you need they're like where's matt cox she's like i have no idea that fucker left me like a year ago so so but she contributed to the story to the legend that's already growing oh oh because she was interviewed by fortune magazine and it was horrendous the article is horrendous he was abusive he he's a don juan that that forced me to fall in love with him commit mortgage fraud and then took all the money and left by the way they found like forty or fifty grand on her and maybe another thirty or forty in her bank account and no other money yeah where's the other money so anyway and she was by the way she got caught she was in communication with her family it was so she's talking to her mom that's when she got caught ultimately and her mother through multiple conversations one conversation being mom i'm doing fine i can't tell you where i am you know exactly but i i'm in houston texas i'm fine next one six months later i enrolled in beauty school houston texas beauty school how many are there yep and her mom bipolar i just want to see my daughter yeah i'm going to call the secret service yep i'm doing the right thing yeah and and honestly she is doing the right thing so so you're getting more and more famous it's mad nationally right so i got all these you you you're you're having threesome with amanda and trina and and what ends up happening is we end up going you know and listen amanda and i we've gone on we've gone to greece italy croatia where where we've gone we're going on multiple just multiple trips and when we had just gotten back from like a ten day cruise of the greek isles and there's we get home and amanda goes online and there's a blog about dateline about their one of their new specials called the thief of hearts and that's me apparently on the thief of hearts and i'm apparently going around and i'm and it's it's based on you know rebecca's becky's story that i'm wooing women to commit fraud stealing all the money and then leaving them to hold the bag well they interviewed her they're interviewing multiple people multiple in my in my case they put together this they're putting together an episode it's going to be released in a few in a in a month or so so i'm terrified i have at this point i've been on the run three years and i'm like i mean there's lots of things i could care less about fortune i don't know anybody that reads fortune bloomberg come on i hang out with i'm hanging out with contractors and laborers and you know i'm not hanging out with these guys so you know local news who cares you know even even local news channels you know i don't care but dateline there weren't four hundred channels back then you know so dateline comes out even if you don't see it the first time they're going to rerun it in three months or six months or five year ten years from now they might rerun it again my face is going to be on it so i could be perfectly fine five years from now and one day i the barista that i go to every every other day look looks at dateline and goes oh my god that's mister johnson or that's mister thomas or whatever so the point is is that i was like yeah i gotta go i can't stay here i gotta get out of the country so i was gonna go to well we really started doing research and amanda ended up saying australia australia at the time i don't know how it is now but at the time if you went to australia with like like a hundred thousand dollars and a business plan you could become a permanent resident alien you you you can't vote but you can buy property you can open a business but you can't get a job and they didn't require fingerprints so there's no criminal background check now if you wanted to be a citizen you have to get an fbi criminal so so what we do is we start refinancing houses we're start pulling out money as quick as we can i'm asking guys laborers guys that i work with my general contractor my real estate agent hey man can you cash this check for six grand keep kept nobody says no everybody yeah no problem no problem not few guys like yeah man if you give me ten percent yeah i'll give you ten percent so that's happening we're pulling out cash one day amanda gives trina a bunch of checks and asks her to cash them that sparks a conversation that like what it was happening she confides in by this point by the way amanda knows who i am mhmm so by this point she's actually came across the letter that i wrote to my parents when i left tampa so she's figured out who i am she tells trina his name's matt cox date lines coming out we're going to we're leaving we got to get a bunch of cash and trina goes okay i'll cash the checks and what she does instead is she calls the secret service they wash my house for three days i come home one day they pull the cars up and they arrest me so you know it's a little bit longer than that but that's shorter there's just a short version of me getting arrested and you know i've probably skipped over a little simple because you've gotten away with much more complex situations it's women man it's women just joking they also are the thing that make life worthwhile listen god bless trina she did the right thing it it honestly based on you go back to the right thing but i mean based on what she saw uh-huh based on what the secret service told her and what the articles that she's reading i'm a bad guy i mean i'm a bad guy in general right so i don't deserve loyalty i i don't think so i i'm ripping people off and she's thinking that her friend is in danger you know the fbi is saying i have a weapon he's he's dangerous he's got a weapon you know we believe he's armed and dangerous when i was in florida i had a concealed weapons permit but i had gotten rid of both my guns when i was placed on probation i've never had one since i've never touched a gun since but they use that to say you know they said oh he had a concealed weapon for him okay well then he's armed and dangerous like there's these little things i think they're telling her read this article look he forces girls to fall in love with them that he he that's what she's going to do your friend so she negotiated also i think she got ten thousand i think it was just embarrassing i'm i'm ashamed that she she got ten thousand dollars and said everything yeah and and told them this is where he is his name is joseph carter you know he's you know this is where he is they watch it they grab me they arrest me they bring me downtown you know what what did what did you feel like when you got i didn't feel good bro it was bad it was a bad day it's a bad day first of all casino royal was coming out on friday it was the first daniel craig as james bond yeah and the whole week i'd been telling amanda i'm gonna go see casino royal she go okay well on saturday we're gonna go to the festival i go that's fine but on friday christina and she's like right christina royal and then she's like okay by the way on thursday i thought we could go to dinner that's fine but on friday yeah casino royale and when they put the handcuffs on you when the first thing i thought of i'm not gonna fucking sit to see casino royale i'm not gonna get to see it not gonna say it and i saw it about about five six years later and when on the institution's movie channel you know it was nice it's not the same but yeah so i they they bring me to nashville then they transport me to all over the place i go on you know conair they fly me to oklahoma they fly me to atlanta then i go to atlanta i'm placed in the u s marshals holdover i get assigned an attorney go in front of the judge plead not guilty meet with my attorney you always plead not guilty you know whenever you these people say can you believe that he pled not guilty that's the first thing you nobody walks in and pleads guilty you plead not guilty while you kind of figure out what you're gonna do so i plead not guilty there's no bond obviously i've got they caught me when they caught me i had four or five passports so that's no good they they charged me with you know bank fraud conspiracy commit bank fraud wire fraud mail fraud passport fraud conspiracy or what it was you know aggravated identity theft money laundering use of a fraudulent passport you know and there's like there's there's like you know thirty counts of this twenty counts of this twenty but none of that matters like even if you just took the dropped all the counts to one count and stack them it's like one hundred and fifty something years not that so everything everything they put yeah and that's what they always say you're looking at one hundred and fifty thousand you know and your lawyers they're like this you're not looking at that you're looking at fifty four years of what that's no better that's no better so yeah so my lawyer comes in and sees me one day you know like our first meeting and i she says you know i'm millie millie dunn and she says listen i've looked at everything for first they say you're responsible for it's like twenty five or twenty or thirty twenty five or twenty six million dollars in loss and i'm like that's i've never that's not true that's not true and i was like you know not even i said maybe not even potential law there's just no way i mean there's no way and then they come back she comes back and she says well they're saying nineteen million now it's not possible tiny thing i don't i didn't know so when the fbi is saying like forty million they're saying eleven point five and tampa plus forty million for the mortgage company so that ends up being like plus what i stole on the run it ends up being like fifty five million but she gets them to drop like the forty like that's that's that's his brokers that's this that's that drop it and they're like we've eased so done it doesn't matter they drop that so it ends up it ends up being like fifteen million and then it's down to what is the l they said nine point five and i got it down to like six million so you know which you know i'm good for so what ends up happening is they've charged me with all these things and and she's like okay you know you're like you can you can plead guilty and you can go with the sentencing guidelines which is gonna be like she's like i mean it depends she said it might be whatever fifty four years she's but if they run them you know concurrent or consecutive depending on which one they do she said it most likely it ends up being like thirty years you know it's like that's not good it's not good so we kind of go back and forth back and forth and figure out try and figure out where i'm looking what i'm looking at now as we go through the whole thing we ended up she ends up with she ends up saying you know she knocks off a bunch of stuff that they're saying i did you know enhancements cause you'll have a base level and a base level of let's say level eight you know that should be that should be maybe a few years but then they start adding on enhancements you know did he what did what he do was it sophisticated yes okay three levels for sophisticated means were there more than how many victims were there more than fifty victims yes okay that's six more levels okay did he change the jurisdiction to evade detection yes that's four more levels okay did he they they start adding boom boom and when you start adding up all those levels plus your criminal history and i have a big criminal history because i was already on federal probation and i committed a new crime on federal probation so that was another enhancement and this you know this case so i'm in like a category i don't know like category two or three so they come back and they're saying i forget it's like twenty well they don't come back right away but she ends up saying you're probably looking at fourteen years okay that's reasonable that's reasonable and so she's saying so we get the when we get the psi back we eventually get what's called a percentage report they're saying twenty six years but they really said thirty two years and i argued and we got it down to twenty six years and four months that's what it is it's three hundred and sixteen months that's how they do it in months doesn't sting that much i guess if you say months yeah so she says to me millie sits down with me and she says listen you gotta cooperate and i was like okay and she said because you're you're you're guilty you're extremely guilty she's like you can't go to trial and she said so you need to cooperate i was like well what do i get if i cooperate and she's the way it works is you cooperate and you hope for the best and i was like are you serious she was you tell them everything you know and you hope for the best and she's like the the what part of the problem is she said everybody in tampa's cooperated rebecca has cooperated everyone across the board is cooperation there's nobody that hasn't cooperated by the way when you say cooperating mean they're an informed they told they said aka snitched right they they came in they sat down with their lawyer and they said this is what he did he did this he did that they showed him documents yes yes yes that's my signature i didn't know what that was you know they everything was my fault they didn't do anything it was all me so they've all cooperated and they haven't been charged they've been indicted they're all named as unnamed co conspirators on my indictment so i've got like twelve people i mean there's like probably twenty people that are involved but there's like twelve of them that are so i've got all these names you know k b d l c y you know it's like i know who that is like i know who dw that's dave walker i know who you know i know who these people are and so there's just a list of there's like twelve of them you know plus me so and some of some of them walked in and said i'm guilty i just want to be plead guilty th the the girl alison she walked in said i i'm i'm too tired of waiting for you to come get me walked in with her lawyer and said i just want to plead guilty and and they sentenced her and she went to jail she got like thirty six months or thirty months she called the prison the day she went to the low security it was a female prison at the time female camp called the camp and asked her if she could come by for a tour before she went and they went excuse me she said well i'm going to be there for about two years so i'd like to come in as a little like a tour i can take cause i like to know where i'm going and what it's going to be like how i should prepare and they just started laughing they said there's no tour sweetie we'll give you the tour when you get here you gotta love that like she yeah i mean i thought i was i didn't think i thought i wasn't prepared i mean there's no door so becky becky got seventy months but when i got caught and when i was sentenced they reduced it to like thirty or no forty to forty months they reduced it she cooperated that term right do you wanna say snitch or well there must be i mean snitch is too harsh of a word but yeah they're i mean you're saying i don't know well we can get there we'll get there alright alright so where did the sentencing end up so i should say first on the cooperation yeah subject my lawyer wanted me to cooperate and by this point i realized like you don't have a choice you know no that's that's not true i could have been a gangster yeah i don't need to be a gangster in this game like you're a stand up guy i could have said i'll just take it give me fifty four years go fuck yourself i'm not gonna snitch on nobody and i know you look at me and you think tough guy i'm not a tough guy at all i'm not doing fifty some odd years like i'm not doing it i don't wanna do thirty years you know i was hoping for you know i knew it wasn't possible but i would have satisfied first another slap on the hand like i got the first time i really thought i deserved honestly when you if someone when my lawyer asked me what do you really think you deserve and i thought i i deserved ten years you know i deserve ten years but so she said look they want to talk to you so the fbi well first the s the secret service lies in they come in and they interview me who's more terrifying fbi secret service you know the secret service was so overwhelmingly professional the fbi and really only the one of the fbi agents that interviewed me i don't know how he's an agent i i don't know he was just ineffective incompetent oh so it's a competence issue the other one was candace oh you met her at mention of course i did of course she's what what was her five eleven wearing three inch heels yeah she's a giant mhmm and in impeccable shape mhmm attractive one of the angriest human beings i've ever met and every fbi agent that i've met since then that knows her and i mentioned they all say oh what'd you think of her and i'm like what why they go i was like kind of aggressive they go yeah yeah yeah she's a bulldog she's a i mean all of them are like yeah yeah she's she's something else like secret service is a little bit more like very personally very you know it's their job it's like hey this is just my job they're polite professional you know that's it so it's just this is just this is my nine to five so but they they they come and they fly in and they meet with me for three or four days one of the one of the funny things is that when i first first sat down with them the one guy's name was dan like bras bras and skalski or something so he he sits down and he says look before we get started we we need to talk about something and i said what he said we know you've hidden money and we you know i was like what and he goes you you know we we know you've got money hidden i said don't have any money hidden what are you talking about and my lawyer's like do we need to talk i'm like no no no no i don't have nothing i gave you everything i gave you all the accounts you got everything and he's like you're looking at an obstruction charge at this point i was like i don't have anything and he says we know you have money we know you have money in different ids different identities names and i go what are you talking about and he pulls out a bank statement and he slaps it on the counter and he goes you've got money in southern exchange bank you've got a hundred and ninety thousand dollars in southern exchange bank and i look at it and i went it was in the name walter holcomb and i went did did you call the bank he says yeah we called the bank i went okay did anybody call you back and it they go he said well no we've left several messages i said did you go to bank website he was yeah i went to the website i said what'd you think and he went what do you mean i if it was bank website i said yeah but it was professional right it was like a professional website and he goes it's a bank website and i go yeah but it's it was well done mhmm and he goes oh god and i go yeah convincing and i went i go it's all an illusion and i said the bank doesn't exist it's a fake bank i made the bank made it when i was in not even in tampa i think i i got into nashville when i made it and i was like yeah it's in the lou the the the bank statements he's like their color bank statements i'm like yeah well no shit so you know there's no i said a matter of fact i said who did you leave a a i haven't paid for the service in months and he turned around and he called it and it went you know you know it it was disconnected and i was like how do you not know that's a bank well it turns out there was a southern exchange bank and i'd use their bank routing number and so i mean i always thought that was funny that they it's like well i remember it really for a split second there i was kind of like really embarrassed that they caught me i was like i believe this you're the secret service anyway i talked to them i you know there's there's really as far as the secret service is concerned there's just not much i can tell them there's just you know like it was me becky's already told them everything amanda's already told them everything it's not hard to track and when that when they raided my house they've got boxes and boxes so it's laid out we still it took forever like i still went through everything i explained how i got the driver's licenses how i made the the bank statements how i made the birth certificates how i the whole social engineering of figuring out how to what these little loopholes are it's like seven days total with these guys so yeah it was like they questioned me for all day and then they take me back to the marshals holdover and then the next morning i wake up and they chain me up again and bring me back what's that like what's that process of questioning like are are they i mean you're somebody who is exceptionally good at conversation charismatic it was part of the games you played are they good at conversation i mean they're you know the problem is they're not there to shoot the shit do you see what i'm saying like they have an agenda but they have to use their words to get information out of you aren't they trying to limit to you i'm not i'm not holding anything back okay i'm not it's not like i'm sparing jim you know trust me jim's gotta go i mean you're looking at you're at twenty some odd years with jim can do five bill can do some tom can do six i don't even like i don't even like jerry jerry can do twenty you know so i'm i'm ready i'm ready to cut everybody's throat but you're not guaranteed that you're not you're getting anything for that right and all my time i've seen one one time where an inmate got a guarantee to have his sentence reduced and it was signed by the head of the fbi was robert mueller gave it to him to have a conversation with him that's the only time i've ever seen that document okay so a lot of days with both the secret service and the fbi so fbi was candace was irritated didn't like me and i remember when i she took the cuffs off i was like rubbing my wrist she goes your wrist hurt and i go yeah and she goes get used to it and she was just an asshole yeah just all around not that she didn't have a right to be but everybody else was professional you know so okay and this so we we you know we we we talked for three or four days with the fbi and you know they asked a ton of questions they brought a ton of they brought documents you know so it was like hey who signed this you know it's like oh that's not that's not my signature that's so and so signature or i signed that i signed that i signed that that's so and so where'd this check out who is this oh that's so and so you know you're looking over everything one of the things they wanted to know about was which which i never talked about because it's it seems so minor is i bribed the politician i got him elected because we got him elected to the city council so he could vote to get our our the lots we bought like a hundred vacant lots in ybor city and i wanted them all they were all single family we wanted them zone multifamily and so we bribed him and got him elected that doesn't seem minor it's not as sexy as the rest of the that's pretty i mean so that's a whole another thing like i i mean you know alright so what happened is when they got all of the bank accounts they see all these checks going to kevin white and so they're like why did james red donate five hundred dollars to kevin white why did brandon green donate why did alan duncan donate why did it you know so i had explained to him oh yeah well he was we wanted him to be city councilman so we paid you know gave him a bunch of money so he could run the ad so he could get elected so he could then get all of our stuff but because he never did you know i took off on the run before he was able to do that and and then he ended up getting not long too too long after that he ended up about five six years later he ended up getting indicted for bribery but not mine on somebody else's case can i take a small tangent here and ask how many politicians do you think commit crimes are a little bit or a lot criminals i mean i think there's some ways that are you know they're they're they're seemingly legal the aforementioned gray area well that's not gray like i i this guy was i at one point i couldn't find anybody to write five hundred dollars checks anymore so i just gave him cash like i'm just handing him seven dollars eight thousand dollars ten thousand in cash so but you know i think most of them have legal ways to make ungodly amounts of money for influence you know but is it legal no it's their politicians they've made it so that it's not illegal if you really sat down and explained it to someone you know the average person would say that that's that's not right that oh no no that's legal so okay so at the end of these few days what was the sentencing like yeah i i end up i go to sentencing i i get my psi back and it's thirty two years to life and and so we argue about it with the prosecutor just before sentencing and they get it down to the twenty six years four months and then millie says listen don't worry because i'm trying to backpedal at this point i'm like i might as well go to trial if i lost a trial i couldn't get more than thirty that you can't well more than thirty two years cause you can't can't get life thirty two was the max it's just a mistake he said thirty two years to life you can't get life so it was like the most i can get is thirty two years so i was like i'll go to trial i might as well go to trial and see if i can get them to reduce some of these enhancements she insists that she can get the enhancements knocked down and if you read they actually read the enhancements some of the enhancements they didn't apply to me so she goes and and you know i believed her and i think she she made a valid argument we get to we go to sentencing my mom's there she's crying my dad's there he's looks at he's looking at me like he's disgusted and crowd there's a whole bunch of reporters like the whole place is packed and i plead guilty millie gets up my lawyer gets up and she argues these enhancements and every single time you know the judge is like i disagree you know overruled and it's like boom five more years you know bam six more years bam so because if she had won the enhancement she argued i would have got fourteen years now keep in mind too prior to this a month or two prior to this the pro us attorney had called million said look dateline dateline had already come out by the way remember i was worried about dateline coming up well it had come out but they wanted to do a follow-up because it came out like a month or two after i got arrested and they were saying hey we want to recut it with interviews with him well gail mckenzie wants that's the us attorney she wants me to do that and she says i'll consider that substantial assistance now when you cooperate with the government they consider it substantial assistance that's what they call it so i cooperate with you it's substantial assistance she says if he's interviewed by dateline we'll consider it substantial assistance and millie says you have to do it by the way what's the idea behind that that like you serve as a warning for others or something like that yeah exactly it's a heat you know you become a cautionary tale like don't let this happen to you so i go and i i'm interviewed by dateline i i've keith morris or whatever his name is you know that that guy mister you know that guy so he comes and he he he interviews me becky's interviewed i'm interviewed amanda's interviewed like alison is interviewed like everybody the secret service agent i think is interviewed like everybody prosecutors interviewed you know i it's funny at the time i would have i was when i watched it i was like that's not true and that's not true and that and it honestly was like ninety nine percent true it's like looking back on it yeah you know i'm i'm like you know like my audi tt wasn't blue it was silver you know it it's just stupid but anyway so i'm interviewed by them and they recut it and they air the video so i you said this was substantial assistance and then the other thing is i was interviewed by the fbi and the secret service now my my lawyer calls the prosecutor the night before sentencing and says look he was interviewed by dateline and he was interviewed by the secret service and the fbi and if you do that you said you'd reduce his sentence you'd consider it substantial assistance and you would reduce his sentence what are you going to ask for his sentence to be tomorrow at sentencing and she said we did consider it substantial assistance and it's just not enough what do you mean nobody was arrested yes but what about dateline millie i i don't know what to tell you it just wasn't enough we considered it we we considered it we will consider it and they did consider it so oh man yeah that's like the that's you have to really you know the meaning of words is so important i'm gonna use that at some point i'll consider i will consider it i considered it it's not so and still feel the same she's so she calls me i'm i'm crushed and she's like but look you know they're still investigating they're gonna make these arrests and so when you get a sentence reduction at sentencing it's called a five ks one when you get a sentence reduction after sentencing it's called a rule thirty five so she said we'll file a rule thirty five as soon as the arrests are made okay so i go to sentencing and millie says you're gonna get fourteen years i'm gonna argue these enhancements she argues you the enhancements she loses the enhancements not that she's not an amazing attorney she's an amazing attorney the judge wanted to hammer me he hammered me you know millie was a great attorney she was always polite to me and by the way to this day we'll answer my phone call like most you most public defenders you call them now you call them after your sentence they don't they don't answer your call great person thank you miller i didn't give her anything to work with you know it was like i'm a little overwhelmingly guilty it's like there's no defense so i ended up getting sentenced twenty six years it's a lot of years i would like to tell you that they they when they gave me the time you know that i i was stoic and i i stood there and i i took it in you know but but the truth is i cried like a baby like a small child like you've never seen anyone cry like this in your life i was just how did i get twenty six how what did i do to get twenty six years like murderers rapists i've met guys that kidnapped guys that got fifteen so yeah hey i were you scared i mean you know does a pope wear a funny hat like of course i was scared terrified and i i mean you know but i kept telling myself ah they're going to reduce the sentence they'll reduce it they'll reduce it they'll reduce it they're like okay okay okay it's going to be okay it's going to be okay you know but it wasn't okay i i got i got moved to coleman the coleman complex and coleman florida the federal correctional coleman complex in coleman florida which is the largest complex in the nation federal complex in the nation there's a there's a at that time there was a a camp which was a female camp there was a medium security a low security prison for men a medium security prison and two penitentiaries and so i get moved to the medium i'm moved to the medium not because like that's where like real criminals go right like i'm i'm a soft white boy like i'm no danger to anybody like i i i hurt i hurt someone's feelings once but other than that i'm i'm i'm not a pro i'm not going to be a problem but if you have more than twenty years to serve you have to go to a medium so even though my security level said this guy should be in a camp i had twenty years so if you have you can't go to a camp till you have less than ten so as soon as i given twenty six years and twenty six years they they knock off three but you still have three years to get below twenty so they go to the medium so i go to the medium and their guys getting stabbed the very first day people are being stabbed i get locked into you go to my cell meet my cell they scream locked down somebody got stabbed in the rec yard i remember i asked that my celly which i'd met twenty minutes earlier i was like what's you know he's like hey we gotta get in the cell i was like what's going on he was somebody got stabbed in the yard and i go somebody just got killed and he goes no they just stabbed him up a little bit and i thought you're in a place where they say stabbed him up a little bit like you're not prepared for this bro you gotta get out of here so anyway i go to the medium i'm there like what was the first day and night i remember i already had been locked up in the county and their their county jails where they call them us their us marshall their holdovers but they're really county jails they just keep you with the with the federal guys so so i'm not mixed in with like hobos and you know people like that like i'm i'm mixed in with the federal people doctor it's already felt like a like a prison yeah it's it's a prison i mean it's it's jail but it's prison in in unless you'd been locked up you don't really know the difference so it's it's a jail jail suck jails are much worse the whole time i was locked up in these in the jails waiting to be sentenced guys were like i just want to get sentenced and go go to prison and i was like why does everybody keep saying that like prison's worse than this right i saw shank shawshank it's horrible and they're like bro prison listen prison i can walk the rec yard i could go to the movie room watch movies out listen within right after count for this four o'clock count they count everybody at four so they are like well right after count i'm going to go to commissary somebody's going to buy me an ice cream i'm going to be eating an ice cream walking on the rec yard the first day like and i'm you know it's been months and months and months and i've been locked up in this county jail and i'm thinking i wanna go to prison like that sounds nice i'd love i'd like an ice cream yeah but there was a stabbing on the first day sure well you know everybody kept telling me i was gonna go to a camp you're gonna go to a camp you're gonna go to a low i see you know and and honestly i was very quickly i was walking on the rec yard i was you know so i was at the medium i got there you know it's it's a real prison with the doors bam and you can open the little tray thing and feed you out of the tray and there's a stainless steel toilet and sink and you know they have that in the county too but you know it's it's exactly what you think of prison as being but it feels like a fundamentally different experience since twenty six years and the door locks and yeah so i yeah i have a a celly and but i'm also they sent me to a prison where guys have tons of guys have thirty forty fifty years you know life sentences there's there's gangsters there there's there's murderers there's serial killers there's you know really bad guys there's you know there's guys that are you know trying to take advantage of guys right yeah like sexually yeah but by the time i got there i'd heard all the you know how you can get yourself in trouble you know how you can like don't go in somebody else's cell you don't know the guy you're not one hundred percent sure do not go in his cell don't even go near his cell don't go into places where people can close the door behind you or they can trap you in an area don't you know there's all these things that i've been told not to do again for sexual reasons right because i'm i'm a small guy in prison yeah you know attract away dude yeah it's a problem it's a problem this yeah it's bad it's all bad well it's good in the outside world but bad in my you know yeah my fear was there make me shave my head to make sure that the mop wig fits correctly but there's certain things that i always hate to say this but i mean this is the simplest way to say it is that if you get stabbed in prison you had it common you did something like they're not running around just stabbing people you did something you and the things that get you hurt is you argue over the tv what channel you want to watch you got fifty eighty guys watching one tv don't argue about it like it's not just not worth it borrowing things that and not returning them that's a problem running up debts that's a big problem you know gambling gossiping you know those are the problem those things get you hurt not being polite be respectful i'm super respectful so i was respectful very quickly when i got to coleman there are continuing education courses one of the courses is residential real estate the guy that was running the residential real estate didn't want to do it anymore because he was doing legal work and it just was taking too much time so he came to me and said listen you just got here you got a real estate background like nobody else does can you take over this class and i was like sure so i looked at his curriculum i kind of rewrote it a little bit and i started teaching them residential real estate class and at one point i was teaching two classes like a semester or a quarter and these guys loved it right like everybody they all think they're gonna get out and flip houses so i started you know from the fundamentals i talk about credit how to borrow how hard money lenders different types of bar like everything and you know guys are walking it's the first time in my life this was funny not that i think i was really in ever in a position for this to happen this was really odd though probably the second or third class when guys are leaving and i'm having to check them off the role multiple guys are stopping and said yo bro putting their hand out and shaking my hand and going good class it was a good class bro then i have guys coming to me telling me hey what are you teaching these guys like what do you mean they go he goes my cell is telling me he's gonna get out and make millions i'm taking cox's real estate class i'm telling you i can do this i'm gonna be a millionaire and it's like this flipping houses like this is not yeah but the truth is if you know it it is the flipping houses was what i basically told these guys especially the drug dealers right the you're a drug dealer and you were raised in the projects and you're going back to the projects like this is this is the one industry or you know that you will thrive at because you're a hustler you're not afraid a forty five year old divorced white woman is not going into the hood knocking on doors to try and flip houses but you will and you know everybody in the neighborhood and you'll knock on those doors and you'll hustle and you'll you you've been told no before and you don't care you're not scared you're not this and there's tons of money to be made in in lower income areas and so i i and then when i go through the whole thing and how you can leverage you know leverage your credit to borrow money to get into the renovations with very little money down and i do the whole thing these guys like they loved it so i was and what that did for me was two things one if you got to the class forty guys show up for the class and i say look if you don't want to go you don't want to be here you just want it cause your your counselor's making you get a certificate you don't want to be here that's fine bring me two coffees and like two creamers from commissary and i'll fill out all your paperwork and you'll pass you'll get a certificate i don't have to see you again i have full of coffee and creamer because at least ten or ten or fifteen didn't want to be there the other guys seriously wanted to be there and i don't want those guys to be there anyway they're gonna be a problem so the other guys are serious about it and and some of these guys sat through the class two three four times some of these guys got out and sent me money so you know which is like a huge sign of respect you know by the way cause they don't owe me anything but i did that and i taught ged because you know you have to do something for for money and you know i met some some i met a bunch of cool guys and i was hanging out and i was doing well and after about three years they they transferred me to the low security prison at this point like the the fbi starts showing up asking me questions they asked me questions about the politician i bribed you know asked me questions about him statue of limitations was up and they were trying to tie him into the bank fraud because his name was kevin white and one of my guys' name was michael kevin white mhmm and so they were trying to tie him in you know did you did he know about it because if he knew about it statute of limitations is ten years we could no he didn't know should've throw him in there but anyway because like couple years later he gets indicted he ends up going to jail anyway and it could've decreased your sentence yeah listen listen stop stop listen oh my god i got all my judgment out after the the homeless conversation listen it's only gonna get worse oh i mean i i really appreciate your honesty and your insight about like about snitching honestly that i have a sense that that there's at least a desire for loyalty in the world i wouldn't that be nice did you ever feel in danger in and medium or low it's funny i had more problems at the probably at the low than i did the medium but at the medium the only thing that happened was an article came out in the newspaper when i was at the medium it came out and said because they're you know they're still investigating things so this article comes out and i'm on the front page of the st petersburg times it was about the politician big article and in the article that says they interview millie my lawyer and she says well when mr cox was being interviewed by the fbi one of the first things they wanted to know about was this politician so she just said mr cox was being interviewed by the fbi so i immediately get taken into custody and they put me in the in the shoe that the whole right for my own production and i'm there for like forty five days and then after forty five days they're like cox what do you what do you what do you want us to do you want us to ship you i was like no put me back on the compound i'm like half the guys here cooperated and he goes yeah it's more than half he said but this is this is a guy from sis which is like their internal security that's when he told you that it's actually much higher percentage right he said but he goes but ninety percent he said but a hundred percent of them are lying about it he said you just came out in the newspaper i go man i'm not concerned if he's you are concerned you gotta come immediately to the lieutenant's office and tell us we'll ship you i said okay i get out there people are giving me like the looking at me and what's up you know but i don't have a lot of friends anyway and i come there to make friends and so at one point this one guy comes to me i'm walking in the yard probably two days later after i get on back on the compound i'm walking guy comes to me he has a goatee and he's got a it comes down here and he's got a skull like a little skull thing he had he'd made mhmm whittled out of wood or something and you know definitely looks scary but so i'm walking and he stopped me and goes hey cox i've never talked to these guys i'd been there for a year or so and never talked to any of these guys they're all like bikers and you know aryan brotherhood and so you know i'm like yeah what's up he said bubba bubba's their leader he goes he has bubba told me to tell you not to walk the yard he don't want to see you out in the yard and i went okay i said well i'm going to walk the yard tonight i said and if i get the shit kicked out of me then i get the shit kicked out of me but did you talk back to a guy with a with a with a wooden skull hanging off his i did but you know what it was right in front of the guard shack and so there's guards in the guard shack you know like they're twenty feet away really you weren't scared i mean i i i think i just got numb like i'm not stupid but i'm all i'm walking around i'm you you know i was scared from the moment i got there on if that makes sense so you get to a point where you're just numb and you're waiting for it especially when i got out of the shoe got out of the shoe i went straight to my cell laid down a couple minutes later it was locked down they closed the doors i wake up the next morning i go to chow i go to my job like it starts all over again so i was i had a very packed routine so i didn't spend there although there's guys everywhere and i'm i'm thinking at some point i might just be walking around a guy might walk up and just smash me in the head but it didn't happen and it's not the guys aren't getting stabbed but they've got it coming i didn't tell on anybody here i didn't do anything it's not that on other yards i might not have gotten smashed but i didn't get smashed and i'd been there a while and i taught the real estate class and everybody wanted to take real estate take real estate so i think that insulated me to a degree i also had made a few friends there and i i think they were probably also kind of putting out the words like bro cut this guy a break so i'm walking across and i tell the guy i said look man i said i you know and i wasn't rude to him he wasn't even rude to me really he said don't walk the yard anymore bubba i didn't want you to walk in there i said well listen i'm going to go to chow and then i'm going to go out there tonight and walk the yard and if i get smashed i get smashed i go because i got twenty six years and i cannot walk around for the next twenty six years not going on the yard i i said so i'm gonna be there and if that happens then that happens and he looked at me and he goes man i don't give a fuck what you do is that's what bubba told me to tell you he said i told you and he because i don't give a shit what you do and he walked off i went out there that night with a buddy of mine named zach a guy named john gordon with my cousin and a couple of his buddies we walked the track for about an hour bubba and a group of his guys stood there and looked at us and as we walked probably close as we got to him was thirty or forty feet that went on for thirty minutes and then they kind of broke up and went their separate ways and you know there was a couple of times where i would go to the chow hall and i would go and i'd be sitting at a table and bubba would walk up and tell the other guys at the table i wanna let you guys know you're he didn't even call me a snitch he said you're sitting with a a cooperating witness he said he said that's how you wanna roll he said you ain't gonna be rolling with us if there's any trouble and then they all kinda looked at me and they got got up got their plate and they moved off he didn't tell me to move mhmm and he could've walked up and said this is a snitch motherfucker he didn't do that mhmm bubba was very respectful so as respectful as he could be whatever you wanna say about bubba right he was a respectful man you ever talked to him directly never had a conversation with him so that went on but i mean not when i say that went on i mean like literally like that's a couple of times he said the same thing to a guy in line one time guy came up to me later and said look man but i'm sorry man he was standing next to me in line bubba said something to him he went like ten or fifteen people back and stood in line later on he came up to me man i'm sorry bro but you know i blah blah blah i said bro i said look i get it we're not friends don't worry about it and and here's the thing at some point there i got i ended up getting well the fbi started showing up there at the at the prison questioning me about my files in in tampa that we're in those twelve guys that were indicted they show up and they start asking me about it and so they're still kind of working it well at the same time i ended up getting moved to the low security prison i get the low security prison they show up over and over again but at some point they come to me and they say look we went to the us attorney we presented everything we have we have it we i have i have enough for an investor i have enough for to indict all of these guys i think it was whittled down to maybe eight instead of twelve and they said look the entire economy is melting down at this point these are some of these are four or five years old we don't we we've got banks that are melting down right now we got we got hundred two hundred three hundred million five hundred half a billion dollar banks that we're investigating we don't have time to deal with this we're not gonna and we're not going to indict those people so they get away the agent i was working with her name was leslie nelson very nice person she came actually didn't have to do this came to the prison to tell me this is what happened and when she'd first come to see me i told her listen i want to do all this but no matter what happens i need you to write me a letter if they don't and and if they don't indict these people i need you to write me a letter that i can present to the us attorney on my behalf that i i did everything i could and she was i'll do that it but that's not going to happen we're going to get the indictments everything i was okay so of course a year later she shows up after nothing happens and they've dropped the case she shows up and she tells me what happened and he's not going to do it and i was i go do you remember that you she was i got the letter right now gave me the letter she was like that's it great letter you know it says you know mr cox has worked you know blah blah blah he's done this this is great and even said you know he deserves a reduction in my opinion blah blah blah so but there's no there's nobody nobody was arrested nobody was arrested so i call my public defender i call millie i explain it to her and you know she starts you know she starts crying and she's sorry and well what are we going to do well there's nothing you can do your your time barred like you have one year to file a twenty two fifty five which is to say that your lawyer is ineffective or that the court has made a mistake in some way and it had been over a year it had been years it had been like four years and she's like yeah i mean you're just there's nothing you can do and she's in tears and i kind of feel like i'm done at that point i'm done and what i do is i start writing a book right i write a memoir my memoir and and this is not a shameless plug for my memoir by the way which is amazing interesting but so what happens is i actually i actually write it you know i write it and then i have to rewrite it right couldn't really know what i'm doing you know and i'd been reading true crime and that sort of thing and i've always liked true crime i get a literary agent comes to see me tells me i have to rewrite some stuff we rewrite it as i'm finishing up my memoir there's a guy that comes on the compound and his name is ephraim devaroli ephraim devaroli and his business partner guy named david packows were selling munitions ak forty seven rounds were really tons of munitions but they got in trouble with the this and they were selling them to the u s government for the afghani security forces and there had been an article in rolling stone magazine about him and i'd read it and somebody points them out and says hey that's that guy and i went up to him and said hey bro you just got here he's like yeah i said look if you want to write a memoir or anything i'm finishing my memoir i can always help you i can help you write an outline you can get a professional writer whatever is you need help he's like yeah all right efraim deborah rollie was played by jonah hill in the movie war dogs so a few months later he comes to me and says hey dude they sold the movie rights i was like oh wow that's great and i'm like you and you don't wanna write a memoir and he's like yeah man it was sold to the guys from the hangover movie and i was like so the guys from the hangover movie are going to make a movie about you i said do you understand they're gonna call it like dude where's my hand grenade and you're going to be spicoli from fast time at richmond high like you're going to be a joke all because you don't want to write a memoir and get your your version out there and he was like holy shit so i ended up writing an outline for him we worked together and then he asked like can i read your book and i was like sure and i give it to him and he reads it and he comes back and he said bro this is the best thing i've ever read in my life and to be honest i later found out he'd read about three books in his entire life but still was very it was very nice you know the other two so he asked me if i'll write his book i write his book we work out a deal and we do that because and i'm i'm i'm saying all this because i basically settle in i'm done i'm gonna do twenty six years by the way just on a small tangent how did you how did you know you'd be good at writing i kind of written a manuscript prior to even taking off on the run i used to listen to john grisham books you know i'd listened to them in the car like i liked john grisham books and i'd actually written a manuscript about a mortgage broker you know he writes about lawyers and it's like laurie being a lawyer is not exciting if you can make that sound exciting i can make being a mortgage broker and i wrote a wrote a book you know put it at my desk and you know the fbi found it and they'd you know said oh it's a blueprint to the fraud that he's going to commit it wasn't stop it's as much that character was as much me as john grisham's characters are him but it's still kind of interesting that it is john grisham didn't right i mean you know if john grisham did something similar to what one of the yeah you know i saw a quote somewhere that the criminal is is a true artist and the detective is merely a critic something like that does that resonate with you or not to look that up okay so you already knew you could write well i knew i liked it but yeah i i think i got better and better at it i mean you know as you're writing and they had creative writing classes you know in prison at the low you know the low was a much different breed of animal you know like it you know it was you could very easily get hurt you could get hurt either place but there were guys that have life sentences that been working out for twenty years and were just super angry you know at the medium and if you got hurt at the medium it was probably really go bad as opposed to you get hurt at the low it's more like a a fist fight in high school so with knives so anyway i so i'm there i'm writing i'm doing that and there was a guy on the compound that came on the compound about that same time his name was frank amadeo frank amadeo is a a rapid cycling bipolar with features of schizophrenia rapid cycling bipolar features of schizophrenia doctor rapid cycling doctor so it's just constant right and so there are moments in in his manic state where he his reoccurring psychosis i guess is that he believes in since he was in his early teens has believed that he is preordained by god to be emperor of the world he's a lawyer disbarred stole close to two hundred million dollars from the federal government they gave him twenty two years and they sent him to coleman but it doesn't this is the part i love the delusions don't affect his legal work it doesn't say a ton for legal community but how do you know he's delusional i'm just asking questions yeah he's he's trust me he i i mean it's it's not me it's like the transcripts the lawyers the doctors the you know yeah yeah there's a ton of ton and then if you saw him in action you'd be like oh wow you know he'd be he would be completely normal he would be having a completely normal conversation and somebody would say something and he was he'd go that makes me so angry i i i can't i'm not gonna let them do that when my legions march on washington we are going to burn the constitution and the president will kneel at my feet and he goes i'm gonna need your transcripts mhmm i'm gonna need a a twenty two fifty five form we're gonna file a you're and it would just what and everybody would sit there and be like okay frank i'll get to this and i'll get it was insane it was the most insane he was basically running a medium sized law firm from inside of the prison he was training people he taught the he taught the the legal research class and was training people on how to do legal research in prison how to put together motions how to fight fight their cases how to do the research how to type them up everything he's teaching he's teaching a law it's just like a law school right like he's teaching these guys he he listened they made such a mistake lock this guy up so he's a great lawyer listen it's gonna get worse it's gonna get worse because here's what happens is at this point i don't talk to him for probably a year or so because everybody's saying he's crazy you know and he's in a for like a year he gets there he's drooling out of the side of his mouth they got him on a ton of medication it takes him about a year to get them to take him off the medication so he he gets them to take him off the medication and then he starts kind of stabilizing his mood by drinking pepsi i know it's probably it's crazy i know it's crazy i know how i see i see you looking at me like this guy's delusional i know it works but whatever works so at some point one of my buddies comes to me and says look you got to go talk to frank well here's the other thing over the course of a year or two that he's starts doing legal work for guys he starts just taking on guys' cases i'll do the motion i'll do your legal work i'll do this keeps them busy but suddenly you start hearing people get released you know you know jimmy just got ten years knocked off his sentence he's going to halfway house next month you know tom got an immediate release frank's walking people up to r and d shaking their hands guys are walking up to him in tears crying and and so you know crazy or not what what choice do i have i i called three different lawyers on the street and said this is what happened what can i do what can i do they they had me they told me to do this and this and this and i worked with them and then they decided not to proceed and what can i do and they said you're hit bro there's nothing you can do you cannot in the middle in the in the eleventh circuit you cannot force them to file a reduction on your behalf you cannot do it it's impossible you're hit you're done it's over i'd love to take your your money mister cox but it's not gonna happen i don't i can't i'm not just gonna take your money you're gonna lose three different lawyers i talked to i or ti's lawyer told me bro it's not gonna happen it's over so my buddy says go talk to frank i said well why why wouldn't i i got nothing else to lose so i go talk to frank he actually has a little manic moment that little thing that i just showed you that's exactly what he said the first time i talked to him based on your case yes i won't let this happen he's like i'm gonna need your transcripts i'm gonna need you to get this i need to see your indictment i'm going to need your percentage reward i'm going to need i was like okay and i turned to my buddy he's like bro i know i know what you're thinking it's fine it's fucking crazy and he's like he's like i understand let just what what choice do you have i was like fuck so frank files a twenty two fifty five motion on my behalf stating that i'm not time barred that millie was we filed it against millie stating that she was ineffective right that she didn't understand the law she had me plead to something because she thought i could get a reduction simply for doing dateline oh by the way when i was in the medium the government came to me and asked me to be interviewed by american greed i do that i'm interviewed you know they they they get me on the phone they talk to me everything my the prosecutor wants me to do it she's re interviewed everybody's re interviewed it airs millie goes to them to the government says look reduce the sentence they go no millie it's not enough then they come to me and they ask me to write an an ethics and fraud course i write an ethics and fraud course the guy writes a course with the that flies up to atlanta he talks with i think he drove up but he goes up to atlanta he talks with a us attorney talks to millie she insists if he does this i will reduce his sentence i will definitely consider this definitely consider yeah definitely consider and then we do it it's being used all over the nation not enough considered yeah that's where at this point i go to frank i tell frank what's happening frank says yeah this is his every time they asked you to do something it reset the time bar you have a year from that time to file a twenty two fifty five now he insists that that was a viable argument nobody else does but he said i'm not going to let them do this i'm going to take care of this i'm going to get your sentence reduced okay emperor okay emperor so he is a character anyway he so he files a twenty two fifty five the government comes back they say he's time barred frank comes back he he you know they answer his motion he files a retort they file you know it just goes back and forth this goes back it's held for six months to a year and at some point i go to mail call and you know they call my name and they they hand me this thing and i open it up and it says the government's filed a motion for a stay so that they can they want the court to appoint me a lawyer and to discuss filing a rule thirty five reducing my sentence and i you know i like i'm like i read it but i couldn't even understand like we don't understand so i mean i rushed to go find frank i show it to frank and he says he says yeah they're staying it they're going to send you a lawyer and you're going to negotiate for how much they're going to reduce your sentence he says perfect so they fly this woman down her name is esther panich she flies down we comes to the visitation room they bring me there the lawyer's room whatever they call it and so we're sitting there and i remember we're talking and she says listen your your motion your twenty two fifty five is written well but honestly you don't have much of a prayer and they're offering you a one level reduction which is thirty months and i went oh that's that's not enough and she said well i don't know what to tell you she said they're willing to bring you back and i was like well you know i mean i don't know i gotta talk to frank frank said i deserve this many levels and you know we're going back for it she's she's she's who's frank and i go frank's the guy that's doing all my legal work she goes he didn't write all this and i was like no she goes who wrote and and i i explained it to her and she's like he's an inmate and i was like yeah and then and she's why is he here and i tell her well because he's she stole a bunch of money from the federal government because he's trying to take over the world so i tell her that whole thing and she's like you're letting a a mentally incompetent you know person do your legal work and i was like yeah because all the competent attorneys wouldn't do it they said i didn't have a prayer your people said i didn't have a prayer and i said frank said he was gonna he could get this done and she's like well i mean you know you don't like that i don't even know why they're offering you one level i was like well frank said you know and i'm like frank this frank that and so she ended up saying she's like you're taking advice from a legally incompetent person i said yeah and she said you know you really don't have a prayer i said then why are you here i said if they could crush me so easily why are you here i said they're giving me one level let me talk to frank i'll let you know what we're going to do so i leave i call her a couple days later i tell her fran and i talked to frank frank said go back go back and argue for more he said i think the judge is going to give you more he's going to give you at least you know between whatever he said like six or seven levels or something so i get i get moved all the way back to atlanta the fbi agent comes to talk on my behalf the guy that like multiple people show up to talk on my behalf they say you know millie who i filed the twenty two fifty five against so i'm basically saying you're you're ineffective you're incompetent you know but she knows the game she's like i i get it she she gets on the stand and testifies for me so the judge goes you know listen i think we were asking for like nine levels or something outrageous prosecutor starts arguing for one level and then he said listen one level is not nearly enough for what mr cox has done he said mr cox i know you're arguing for nine nine levels off your sentence he goes that was never gonna happen i was like i felt like i got slapped and he said so i'm i'm gonna go with six levels no no i'm sorry he said three levels i'm gonna go with three levels he has which is which is seven years which he said for somebody who has no arrest associated with his case he said i think it's pretty good and that's my that's your judgment and blah blah blah blah blah and he hammered put the puts the gavel down and walks off that's it it's over i got seven years i was hoping for more so i get moved back to coleman i get moved back to coleman and i go to up to frank and i said frank i got i got seven years off and he's like i know i know i said i don't mean to sound unappreciative i said i just so i was hoping for more he goes i was too he said it looks like we're gonna have to eat this elephant one spoonful at a time and he goes something will come out something's gonna happen he said keep your ears open something will happen and i said okay and you know i honestly by that point i'd done you know i'd done eight years and i remember like if i got a year off for the drug program and good time and this and i had about eight or eight years left to go over and something nine years left and i was like you know i can do that i'll write you know i'd been writing by that point i'd i'd actually written a story like i got a book deal for deborah you know and i ended up writing a synopsis of a guy's story and i got him in rolling stone magazine and i got a book deal for that like i got an advance it's like three thousand five hundred bucks for being in prison a prisoner to get a three thousand five hundred dollars advance like come a millionaire there's a lot of money so and then we optioned the film rights basically the synopsis that i wrote for this reporter journalist for rolling stone he goes to rolling stone with my with what i wrote and gives it to them and they okay it they say yeah this is great we want you to write an article based on this okay he writes the article he tells me that the article will be from him his name guy lawson douglas dodd which is the name of the kid i wrote the memoir about and matthew cox a couple of weeks before it's going the article is going to be published he tells me rolling stone doesn't want my name on the article because i'm in federal prison and it doesn't look good but don't worry he's gonna put my name in the article and that's just as good and i argue it's not just as good it's not i'm like i would be i would be a a writer for rolling stone magazine like you understand i'm trying to i'm trying to come up with something here that i can rebuild my life as a true crime writer that's no good and what the and that wasn't so bad that wasn't the worst of the worst of it was ninety percent of the article that he published was taken directly from what i sent him like i mean sick to my stomach bro just sick over it so but they option they option the life rights for that and i got a piece of that so there's like seven thousand dollars i get a check for that so i'm thrilled i can keep writing because you have to understand writing on the computer there they charge you so i start right oh they charge you for phone calls writing comma every single thing costs money so i start writing all these guys' stories i start writing books i just come back from went back to atlanta got reese got sent in seven years knocked off my sentence come back and i'm walking around the compound now there was a guy that was there named ron wilson ron wilson ran in the if you look at the newspaper it says it's like a hundred million dollars ponzi scheme but really it was fifty seven million dollars so he had lost fifty seven million so it says a hundred you know they you know they always exaggerate because fifty seven is not enough ron ended up getting nineteen and a half years ron was an old con man early sixties sixty two sixty one i don't know and ron i and i liked ron so we're walking around the compound and he's like so what are you going to do i mean you got you got eight or nine more years to go and i was like ah you know i'm going to keep writing and when i get out of here maybe i'll have a huge body of work and maybe a boo sell it or maybe i'll be able to option some more stuff and if i could get together with rolling stone or get with some of these magazines i could start writing for them and i could option those maybe i could walk out of here with something so right right right so ron was who'd only been locked up like a year or so he was cooperating with the secret service in his case against some of his co defendants so he's he's already been debriefed and he's cooperating he's actually thinking he might get brought back to have to testify at a trial we're talking and we're walking and he keeps saying you know even if i even if they they charge those guys and even if this happens they're not gonna reduce my sentence they're not gonna cut my sentence and you know first of all well probably because you stole a bunch of money from pension funds and churches that didn't help your case but i don't say that so i i say oh they have to bro they'll have to they've they've you know if you cooperate they're gonna have to and if they don't we'll have frank file a twenty two fifty five and he's like that crazy month so he says okay he's like yeah yeah you don't understand you don't understand so this goes on for months and i and i'm like what is the problem and he says you know they think i hid ponzi scheme money you know and he'd actually dug up like five or six million dollars in ponzi scheme proceeds that he dug he he he buried in these literally buried in aluminum ammunition canisters mhmm he was super interesting guy so he actually went and dug them up and gave them to him and i'm like well you gave them all the money it's you didn't hide anything relax it's not a big deal they're not gonna find anything so don't worry about it and so he mentions it a couple weeks later couple weeks later and then one day i go bro why do you keep bringing this up like what are you concerned about they're not gonna happen and he said can i trust you and i went probably not and he goes i did hide some money i was like okay i said you you just bury it in a can somewhere and he's like no he said i get my wife like a hundred and fifty thousand in cash i said okay well she's not gonna say anything she's using it so now you don't understand since then she found out i was having an affair and we're going to get a divorce and she hates me and i think she'll turn that money in just to make sure that i don't get a reduction because if you lie to the fbi they're not going to it doesn't matter what you've done for them they won't give you anything and so he's played i mean i'm sorry secret service or anybody he is clearly a lie to the secret service at this point if she goes and says this is what he gave me mhmm so he's like i was like oh wow and he's like and i gave my my brother's holding maybe thirty thousand for me and at that moment i was like wow like this poor guy no that's not what i thought at all what i thought was is that enough to get me a sentence reduction you son of a bitch and i went and i sat there and you know what i thought i thought i i i did i thought no i thought that's not enough that's not enough it's nothing that's not even two hundred thousand dollars yeah like and they didn't wanna give me a reduction my prosecutor was pissed that i got seven years off she wanted me to get thirty months mhmm she's not gonna give me anything it's up to her she's not gonna do it so i go i lay down i go to bed like a month later i'm on the phone with my lawyer cause i had written remember i wrote a man my i had a manuscript for my book and i wanted to put some of the stuff that was said at my in my sentencing in the book so i was trying to get my lawyer to mail me my transcripts and she hadn't done it so i called her and i said listen you said you were gonna she's like oh god man i'm so sorry i'm so busy i'll do it i'll do it and then she went this is esther she goes so what else is going on in there and i and this she never wanted to talk to me like she didn't you know when they were paying her she didn't wanna talk to me and and i was like what do you mean nothing i just need my transcription she's like nothing's happening there's nothing you wanna talk about and i was like and i went you know what you know what there's something weird happening listen to this and i told her about ron wilson mhmm and she goes hold on she she looks them up on the computer she goes oh wow this is a bad guy this is a bad guy and he told you then you know where to absolutely and she and i can tell you exactly and she goes okay okay okay she goes let me look into this i go okay so a week later a ceo comes to me and goes hey cox and i go what's up he goes listen at the next move cause you know they have controlled moves all the doors are locked and they open them up for ten minutes so you can run to the chow hall or you can run to the you can't run though they're no running on the compound but you can walk fast yes to the rec yard or the library whatever he says the next move go to sis you know so i go to sis on the next move but i i was used to going there by the way because i i was constantly ordering freedom of information acts and they would so i'd order your your an inmate and i'd order i'm writing a story for you and i'd order it and they'd send it to me and then they would catch it and they'd be like why are you getting lexus mhmm information so they'd call me down there i go no i ordered it for him and i'm writing a story and i'd already been in rolling stone and they were like what's the story and i tell them the story they got some pretty good story here and so i go down there but this is different this the guy answers the door and his guy they call him bulldog he was a real asshole he was a lieutenant sis and he's like come in here get in here cox sit down and he dials the phone he goes here you gotta talk to this guy and i'm like what i pick up the phone i'm like hello and the guy goes hey this is agent griffin with the secret service i understand you know where ron wilson is has hidden ponzi scheme money i woah woah woah woah i want something in writing i want you know so i start doing that and they go okay and then i get his his email address and we start emailing each other back and forth mhmm and he ends up getting a letter from the us attorney in south carolina that says they will consider it substantial assistance if they if they make arrests or recover a substantial amount of money mhmm that's the best i'm gonna get is consider so i start talking to this guy and he starts asking me questions about ron wilson like hey ask him this ask him this so i'm like bro i gotta kind of work that into a conversation that's an odd thing to ask so this goes on for six months so i'm asking questions and i'm typing up little reports and i'm i'm a i'm a i'm a prison snitch now so i'm not just like cooperate i'm now i'm a prison so i've l i've moved down i've moved down actually from being just a cooperating witness or because you're in prison is that what makes you a prison change you can't even really say no you could say prison rat you can say prison rat i think prison snitch i think that's probably the closer to the term that most guys would use what's the difference between a snitch and a rat in prison i'm not sure i it's it rolls off the tongue better prison rat doesn't sound as good as prison snitch i don't know mhmm i don't spend a lot of time thinking about this so what happens is i'm asking wilson questions periodically and at some point they contact me and they say listen wilson's about to get some bad news i go okay and they go he's you know like i don't wanna tell you what it is let us know what happens so like two days go by and one day wilson comes up to me one day and says cox cox and i'm like oh shit i'm like hey what's up you know and and he's like oh you're not gonna believe this i got indicted i was like what what happened no yeah my wife they questioned my wife and my brother and my brother my wife walked in first she said i don't have nothing i don't know what you're talking about the next day the brother walks in and gives them a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in cash and so the next day the wife comes back and gives them two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in cash and a bunch of silver like gold bullion and silver you know cause this he was his his ponzi scheme was based off of silver you know he was gonna invest in silver for you so half a million dollars they turned over half a million like half a million dollars i thought she was like a hundred thousand or something and he was he was like i know i didn't know i could trust you i'm like ron what are you doing i thought we were so he so i'll tell you something for the icing on the cake by the way the ice on the cake let me explain one more thing yep there's so if you're going to if somebody cooperates with the federal government let's say i get arrested and and they go you want to help yourself and you go yeah okay look jimmy is he lives next to me and he's running a meth house you know a meth lab whatever and they go and they raid jimmy and he gets arrested you're gonna get something off for that not a lot but you're gonna get something now and and they could just say we were gonna bust him anyway we were already on to him right now the next level would be you wear a wire so i wore a wire and i i was in danger now keep in mind i'm asking this guy questions inside federal prison i'm in danger so whatever that's like the next level you're active you're taking an active participate participation in the investigation and the third level would be you actually get on the stand and you cooperate and you you testify that there's no better cooperation than that so when wilson says to me they're going to move me back to south carolina they've indicted me they charged me what do you think i should do and i go i think you should go to trial because i know they'll have to call me as a witness yeah just to let you know because i don't i don't want you to i don't wanna walk out of here and have you feeling feeling like hey there's some there's some good to this guy you know so i'm ready i'm i'm ready to cut wilson like a fish so yeah but you are putting yourself in danger if you get on the stand right i'm already in danger if if people there heard what i was doing i probably would have been in danger increase the chance of them hearing or no i feel it it does but it also increases my ability to get more off my sentence that's true so what happens is couple days later he's on what's called the pack out right they're gonna move him maybe a week later so they come and get him they move him he gets back there to south carolina and he pleads guilty he he they sentence him he gets six months added on so now from nineteen and a half to twenty years and and by the way when covid hit he was released so he only ended up doing like six years on a twenty year sentence because he was older he's by that point he's sixty six sixty seven years old you know he's an old anybody older than fifty five was endangered especially in the prison so they had a a covid thing where they were releasing these guys and sending them home on ankle monitors like he's an old man he's not he he's not gonna hurt he's not he's not a danger so they sent him home so he ended up doing so he didn't even serve the six months he even served the original sentence whatever not that i care so i'm just saying if it makes you feel like poor rod it's okay so his wife got like a hundred year a hundred she got like a hundred hours of community service or something or sixty hour and i think his brother got six months paper so they they got charged with obstruction of justice you know and they didn't neither one of them you know just like six months probation and community service nothing so when we try i turn around i'm waiting for my reduction waiting waiting after about ninety days after this guy gets sentenced maybe six months i send a letter hey what's going on to the prosecuting to my prosecutor there the prosecutor of both districts no response then i go to frank i explain to frank and frank has known what's going on the whole time and frank goes okay i'm gonna file a twenty two fifty five so we file a twenty two fifty five government comes back and they first thing they say is your honor we don't know about any cooperation we've never heard about any cooperation so of course then we submit the letter that we have the judge comes back and the the judge ends up saying it's a little complicated but it he ends up saying look i don't have jurisdiction to hear this because you're you may be time barred but i'm going to let the the appeals court here now typically you have to you have to get what's called a like a right of sort of a certification to appeal you have to make sure that you actually have a case mhmm he says i'm waiving the cert and i'm waiving the five hundred dollar fee to file with them he said and i'm he's he basically expedites it for me which is a subtle way of telling the prosecutor i think he's got something and i'm sending it up there and he and the way he writes his motion it's basically saying i don't have the jurisdiction to hear it to do anything but they do they need to do it and i'm paving the way you don't have to pay any money and you don't need that cert so the prosecution immediately comes back they file a a one level reduction and we immediately frank files something saying hey stop we don't want the reduction we don't want the one level we want to come back to court please don't don't rule on it so the judge says okay i'm freezing everything i'm putting a stay on everything i'm going to give this guy a lawyer to try and figure out what you're going to do they fly down a lawyer leanne weber so she comes in and she comes and sees me and she says listen i i i see that you want to go back and fight this and this but honestly i don't think you're going to get anything more than one level i talked to the prosecution they said they'll give you what she said i can work on trying to get you two levels but you don't have much of a prayer you're gonna get crushed and i said well then then why are you here if they can crush me so easy why don't they do it why would they pay you like they pay them like twelve grand or something just to fly down and all your expenses to negotiate for me why not crush me and she's like i don't know i said well frank said four levels and she's like who's frank i go frank's the guy that wrote all this and she's like oh is he is he an attorney and i go is he in here i'm like yeah he's in here she's like why is he in here and i tell her you've taken over the world and she says that's the strangest thing i've ever heard in my entire life and i said i understand but frank said and she's like you're listening to an incompetent you know and i'm like yeah absolutely and she and frank said four lab we want four levels she he said for me to tell you we want four levels she was okay she leaves she goes to the us attorney we argue two levels they come back and say two levels no we go back and forth we start filing motions saying we want to go back we want a hearing we wanna bring back all the fbi agents the secret service agents and she's like what you wanna turn this into a circus exactly what i wanna do i'm gonna turn it into the biggest circus cause i've already got one level they come back one day she says listen three levels is the best you're gonna get she said so i guess you'll be moved back here we'll go to the hearing i said no no no i'll take three levels and she goes what are you talking she said you said four levels you said frank wouldn't take unless you take anything less than four i said no frank said to tell you four i was happy with three i wanted you to argue for four i'm good with three i'm out of here in like a year so and i don't wanna be moved back i don't wanna have to get on that bus you know what it's like to be moved it's horrible so i said i just want the three levels so then we argue about the wording for about two three months and then they file it and then i get five years knocked off my sentence because three levels at this at the level i was at now isn't seven years every level you get a little less time so i get five years off so now i've got twelve years knocked off my sentence at this point i may have a year and a half to go and you know that's doable so i was super super happy and i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you something and i'm sorry bro but every time i think about it and i i just feel like i have to say it like frank i'm an insane but i can like i didn't have a fucking prayer without that guy and as crazy as he is as much of a pain in the ass as he was like i could never repay him bro like like i'm not i shouldn't be here i'm supposed to be in prison right now my out date was third was twenty thirty without that guy where does he know he got himself out he didn't do all that time he got himself out i don't even know how he did it he they've even thrown him back in prison again for six months and he got himself out again he's insane he's incredible he's insane but he's incredible is he really that insane he's in orlando is he i mean he seems like he seems like a good lawyer and a good man he look he's he's he's great he's great i mean there's no doubt in my mind i would be in prison right now if it wasn't for him and he's done this for others walk people right out ten years off five years off nine years off ten years i mean it's but i didn't pay and i didn't pay for one thing i didn't pay for my stamps he paid for everything sounds like the other lawyers don't really believe it's possible and he does it's interesting well i think he's he was willing to he's willing to badger them into doing you know what they should have done to begin with i actually wrote a book about it which he loved about him about him and his story his it's so over the top what happened with him i mean little i tried to take over the congo i mean there's a a documentary about it there's it's called nine days in the congo it's an insane story i'm i'm in this one of those stories it's just like how is this not a movie it's not a movie yet no i don't i've pitched it several times and it'd be it would be great but so i wrote a synopsis and i turned that into a book what's the name of the book oh it's insanity it's insanity yeah but about it like a year and a half later like i ended up getting out of prison and i went to the halfway house what would that feel like freedom i was oh this is bad bro this is bad i remember when i was leaving the prison so you know i met some great guys in in prison which is a weird thing to say but i've met better i met better people in prison than i'd ever met outside prison at that low i mean because it was the first time i actually had friends you know like i i really had someone that wanted to hang out with me just to like i didn't i didn't have anything to offer them i can't make you any money i can't do anything for you we just hang out because we like to laugh or have things in common or we're fascinated by each other or we just have good time and fun so when i was leaving i remember my mom showed up and my brother showed up and they picked me up and we were driving off and i remember looking back at the prison and my brother said i'm glad i'll bet you're glad to see that you know to leave that behind you and i started crying it's like nobody talked i was so uncomfortable it was i started crying and and it wasn't because i was like oh it's over it was because it was like survivor's guilt you know like i was leaving all of my friends and i felt so bad that i was leaving them but i i went to the i went to the halfway house and i had i had four i had so when i was getting out i remember joking that i had exhausted my true links account my my my inmate account i'd exhausted it i had nothing i had like eighteen cents i couldn't even figure out how to spend it and they give you a debit card when you leave and i said like and they charge you every time you you swipe you use the card like i don't even have enough to spend the eighteen cents you know it's because just charge is like three dollars so i was like i was like yeah yeah i was like i wonder if they're still giving me my debit card and i'm laughing everybody's like what are you gonna eat what are you this what are that and and my one buddy looked at me he was like you can't go to the halfway house with nothing bro and i was like no it's cool i said no it's cool you know i said no it's cool i said i wanna start at the bottom i've got that coming i got working at mcdonald's coming so i'm going to work at mcdonald's i don't give a fuck and he was like well i think i use i i think you're gonna need to buy clothes i think that's it oh it's sell i said it's it's at the it's it's at the goodwill they'll give you a bunch of they give you a bunch of crap if you don't have anything if you're indigent and i said i'm indigent and a couple of days before i'm leaving four hundred dollars ends up on my account and i was like what the fuck and it was from a buddy of mine and i go to him my buddy tommy and i was like tommy did i go did you have four hundred dollars on my account and he said i can't let you go for it with nothing bro so i get to the halfway house and i go to walmart and i buy three hundred dollars worth of clothes at walmart i've never been in a walmart i go to a superbowl you're huge and i go there and i buy a bunch of clothes and i buy about three hundred bucks worth of clothes and i still have some of the blue jeans to this day i still wear some of the blue jeans and i stayed in the halfway house and i called a buddy of mine named treon treon called and he owns a gym and you know i grew up with him his whole family like they own a bunch of gyms and i i called him and i said hey man i'm in the halfway house and he was like hey what's going on he said can i do anything for you and i was like i mean i need a job i didn't think he was gonna give me a job he was bro you're hired i'll give you a job he said i can't put minimum wage i said that that's fine if i can stay out of here i you can work like eighty hours a week and i was like if i can just stay out of here eighty hours and you pay me minimum wages oh hell yeah perfect so i'm at the gym and i got free rein so i'm playing on my computer goofing off all day and my buddy pete who's still locked up he's texting me and calling me and he's like not texting me he's emailing me through the core link system and and he's calls me periodically he's like have you started a website cause one of the things i was going to do when i got out was i was going to start a website with all these stories that i'd written and i was like no pete i i don't i can't like i don't have a computer he's like well how much is a computer i was like i don't know they're like three hundred bucks i was like i don't i said i could probably get a used apple like macbook like a five year old macbook or something i don't know for like three three hundred and fifty dollars whatever and i said but he was like okay so that's all you need three hundred bucks i go no no no no i said it's not three hundred bucks bro it's three hundred bucks plus it's getting a wordpress website which i said costs money plus it's hiring somebody to help me figure it out because i don't i i'm i'm inept i don't know how anything works so he okay and i said plus i need this plus i need that i mean i got a bunch of stuff i need six hundred dollars for this i need three hundred for this i need five hundred for this i need a thousand dollars for for this and he goes okay he said i'm gonna i'll get you okay i got it so let he reads off a list he goes i gotcha but pete doesn't have any money and i go how are you gonna give me any money he goes he goes every day i walk across the compound some people stop me and say how's cox doing and i say oh he's okay and they say does he need anything and i say no no he's good he said i'm gonna start telling these fuckers yeah yeah he needs something you want to do something for him here's what he needs i ended up getting two laptops sent to me i got the computer program final cut pro i had i had guys in prison cutting me checks so that i could build a website and put all these stories on the website so i start putting the website i don't know what i'm doing i put them on the website slowly it takes forever putting pictures up i'm trying to figure out how you know photoshop works how all this stuff right the whole time i was i wanted to start because everybody the last one i was just getting out of prison everybody kept telling me like bro you got to start a podcast you gotta start a true crime podcast and i don't know what a podcast is the term podcast came into existence in two thousand and nine when i'd been locked up three years i'd never been on youtube yeah so by the time i get out the last year or two guys are coming up to me giving me magazines like this is what a pod you need to read look true crimes huge and you got to think guys are asking me every couple of days cox you got any stories and i'm like hey did you read cash and coke and they're like is that the one where the guys are robbing the drug dealer yeah i don't know i read that one did you read this one no no no i haven't read that that's the one with a guy and i'm like yeah yeah yeah yeah so so i i mean i'm gonna start giving these little stories and then they'd come back and give them to me you know it's you don't have you don't have anything in there right so this is guys that would never read in their life or reading and i'm writing about the guy in in b two the guy in c one so i put up the whole thing and and they're well anyway they're all telling me do a true crime podcast true crime podcast i don't really know what that is but by now i'm starting to listen to them on youtube you know serial mhmm and cold case files you know that kind of stuff and i think that's what i wanna do well my buddy treon says there's a guy named danny jones that runs a podcast called concrete and it's in st petersburg and he lives a couple miles from me i see him all the time and i went okay and he said you should you should email him he's got a guy on there all the time that does real estate and i go i just got out of prison for for bank fraud related to real estate he doesn't wanna interview me he goes well you could maybe he does maybe you could ask him about starting a podcast mhmm okay so i sent him an an email i remember it danny called me and he said hey is this matt i was like yeah this is matt he's he's like i got your email this is danny jones and i was like okay and he says he said yeah i got your email bro he says it's a good fucking email and i was like what he goes i get a lot of emails bro he said that is a good one that's a good one he said that was really good like i mean that was well written he's like i immediately knew how to talk to you and i said oh okay i said cause you know i start off with i think i started off with hey my name is matt cox and i'm a con man i opened it it was recently released from federal prison and so he was like oh yeah i mean who who says that mhmm so anyway he said what's going on i said well and i tell him what's going on i wanna start a podcast blah blah blah and you know danny he listens to me for thirty minutes to an hour and i've heard this and this and he's like yeah right he's you know youtube's not really like that and that's not really how we do it and you know i don't know that you're you're gonna have to get a production company and blah blah blah he goes but you know what what you really need to do is to see if people are even interested in you or your story or you're able to talk you should come on my show you know shameless yeah trying to get some content well i mean so as i told you offline the danny and concrete podcast is really good so people should definitely listen to it yeah but yeah i mean it turns out people do like listening to you turns out i mean you're good at at at telling stories well anyway i by the time i got i couldn't do danny's podcast i was like i can't do it bro i'm in the halfway house so maybe i get out of the halfway house and a couple months go by just maybe two months three months go by and one day i get a phone call from danny he's like bro you're out of the halfway house right and i was like cause i told him i got out in july it was like october november i'm like right he's like listen i had a guest fall through i got nobody i need you to come on i answered all your questions you know i'd called them five six times you know i had you said and i was like oh i was like i'll i'll fuck it i'll do it that video got like a two million views then i did patrick bet david flew me out then i did soft white underbelly you know then i did vlad then i did all like people started and i'm sorry and then you know it just blew up and then people started asking me to come and you know talk for no reason but for which was crazy but you were saying i'm sorry is your dad still with us no he died when i was in prison he came to see me yeah he came to see me like two or three times when is the first time he found out that you were doing fraud the first time i got in trouble when you got the probate because i had you know i had to kind of explain that you know something's happening i didn't want him to hear from anybody else so you so you talked to him directly about it super disappointed did he ever tell you he loves you after that so i after i got the twenty six years and the government decided they weren't going to indict anybody and i really was like wow this is it like you're done he came to see me but just by himself and i remember he i remember when he came to see me i you know he was by it was by himself like he never came by himself so i remember thinking my mom something happened to my mom and as soon as i walked in you know he walked in like what happened i go where's mom and he goes oh she's fine she's fine and he sat down with me and he said and i i he said how how are you doing i was like i'm good and he and he was just like you know he was getting sick he was getting older so you know we talked for a little bit just about the situation and i was like yeah and he's like well what are you gonna do and i was like you know there's nothing i can do like everybody i've i've called multiple attorneys i've talked to people there's nothing i can do and he was like you know we're gonna you're gonna figure it out you know he goes he said you're clever and you're smart and you're gonna you're not gonna do all of that time and i was like i'm done it's over i'm gonna get out of here when i'm sixty if i behave myself and if i don't i'll be sixty four and he was like that's not going to happen and so he said i think that was the first time he you know i knew he was proud of me when i was making money but he never said it you know you got to look like he was like impressed but we were sitting there and he said i remember he said cause it's the only time i can ever remember him saying he was proud of me and i remember he said you're going to figure this out he said i'm not proud of where you ended up but you've done an amazing thing you know i wish you'd use your talents for something different but you've done things that i could have never done and you've led an amazing adventurous life and i'm proud of you and that you know i wish he could see you know my mom i know my mom saw me my mom's funny because my mom came to see me my mom's a gangster my mom came to see me every two weeks for thirteen years she missed about a month and a half when she had a stroke and ended up in a wheelchair and then she came in the wheelchair and she would make my brother bring her bring her my brother and sister would be like mom are you sure you want to go like you know it's it's so hard to it's such a long drive and you get so tired well i'll sleep in the car i know but you know then you we have to wait in that that lot library that the you know in that the waiting area you know forever and it takes forever while i'm in the wheelchair so i'm fine well i know but it's such a pain to get in and out and then in and out and she was like she was i'm going to see my son and you're taking me she yeah so i i so she yeah she was she was something else and and i would say you know like if if i had to say you know i don't think about all the things i did to get out like i know you know there's all these guys that are you know like you know oh i wouldn't have done that you know i'd have been a stand up guy and i'd have been well good for fucking you bro i wanted to get out i wanted out and the icing on the cake of me getting out and i would have cut every motherfucker's head in that prison off i was able to get out just in time to spend the last year and a half of my mother's life with her i saw her two or three times a week took her to dinner once a week was able to go on walks with her in her wheelchair i was sitting right next to her when she had her final stroke i held her hand when she took her last breath so if i have to be called a snitch the rest of my life i don't give a fuck like i may not deserve more but she deserved more do you regret so if you just look back would you do it would you do any part of your life different oh i'd scrap all this yeah yeah yeah i'd scrap all this to be you know you always hear these guys say i wouldn't change it because it made me the man i am today or the man i am today is a fucking fifty four year old scumbag multiple felons starting my life over broke you know living off of scraps you know trying to make youtube work like you know i've got you know two dead parents i'm divorced i have a son that doesn't talk to me i have a son that doesn't talk to me for good reason not because of a misunderstanding because he understands like i he's you can't even argue with him he's got a powerful argument like i don't wanna be a part of this guy's life he's a scumbag he stole money he went on the run he abandoned me when i was you know three years old i don't want anything to do with them like i get it like i you know and i tried to i tried to i've tried to do all the right things you know i wrote the letters i drew him pictures i've tried to call and it's not happening like i would do anything to go back and just be that regular middle class guy with the two kids and the wife working a regular job you know i i like that's a good life you know those are that's a good person and you know i i just made one arrogant decision after another after another until it snowballed and i couldn't take it back and then i did everything i could and if and if i wasn't the calculating backstabbing scumbag motherfucker that i can be i'd be in prison right now sorry you know so yeah yeah i would much rather be a cpa right now i would much rather you know should have stuck with being an insurance adjuster or something i mean you know i never should have why did that thirty day laid out never it was a mistake that was your first mistake that was a huge mistake you think your son will forgive you no unfortunately according to my my ex wife and my sister and everybody that he is a part of their lives you know and i've seen them you know my mother's funeral i saw him you know i i've seen him at several functions you look across and he looks right through me i think that he's a everybody says he's a he's just like you he's just like you and everybody says i'm just like my dad i've never smoked a cigarette i've never drank alcohol not a drop never done any drugs because my dad was an alcoholic and my dad smoked two packs a day and everything in our house reeked of nicotine and i've never smoked and my dad was a pill head he was he was always on some kind of prescription medication he was draw you know and i didn't want to i didn't want to i didn't want to be that person and i and i like one day i drew a line in the sand and i wouldn't do it and i think he's drawn a line in the sand and he's decided you know this is the hill i'm going to die on and i'm not going to back off it and the thing is my ex wife tells him this he's a good person you should be in his life his his father cause he was adopted when i was in prison they adopted him nick is his you know his his dad nick has told him that nick came to see me when i was in prison you know nick has told him like hey you this this is a mistake you're making a mistake nick everybody that knows me knows him and he said he has said no so i fully believe it's no i mean i hope it's not well i hope he forgives you i think there's a lot of good in you despite you calling yourself a scumbag over and over in this podcast keith bothered you you mentioned that earlier what advice would you give to young people given that you've lived quite a nonstandard life what advice would you give them how to live a life they can be proud of i mean it's it's i'm in a position that anybody would listen to me but i cause to me and i don't have any advice that i don't think a father would give you and it's like work hard be appreciative i mean things are so good out here i hear people complain all the time and i think a huge part of just being happy is being appreciative like i didn't appreciate anything when i had this is so cliche but when i had all the money in the world i was miserable but when i got out with nothing i was happier in prison with nothing than i was with two or three million dollars prior to prison and driving dating a chick i was never should have been dating driving a sports car vacationing all over the world miserable i'm crying driving away from prison because i already missed my friends you you could have never told me that was gonna happen turns out money in fact does not buy happiness no and i know and it it is such a cliche right but it's it's so true crying driving away from prison yeah you know what i met my wife in the halfway house so she had just gotten out of prison she was in the halfway house with me she just did five years for like a meth conspiracy mhmm i never would have met her fighting on a prison yeah and now your date night is hunting alligators together yeah we
