dwell on the beauty of life watch the stars and see yourself running with them he like many stoics emphasized the importance of living deeply each moment that we get in this too short life and to

here's michael malice the box yeah the mystery box what's in it there's something in that box of exquisite beauty mhmm both literally and in what it symbolizes and why it is here given the kind of human being you are i'm terrified at what you find beautiful that's a good point mhmm you kinda hit me with a curveball yeah like for me the most beautiful like wildlife are what i call god's mistakes yeah because my friend came up with that term where she's like you know god made these disgusting animals just threw in the bottom of the ocean he's like no one's ever gonna see this yeah you you commented on twitter about some creature like a rainbow type creature the peacock mantis shrimp yeah it's beautiful it's horrific though so it has i think eight legs six arms two punching claws or spearing claws depending on the genus two eyes two antennae two ear flaps i don't know what they do and its punch can be as strong as a bullet mhmm and the other type with the spears divers call them thumb splitters because if you stick your finger near it it'll cut your thumb down to the bone so i had one as a pet all night i would hear banging on the pvc pipe and i gotta tell you they have the best eyesight eyesight of any animal because they see in like seven different ways and when you make eye contact with this thing it's it's just absolutely terrifying but you can eat them as sushi they call them sea centipedes but they're colorful and beautiful that's species yeah what was it like having one as a pet and why did you do it well when you have a species that's that unique and that much of an outlier you know growing up reading these books watching these shows i found this stuff so much more fascinating than like space and which is you know dead so to be able to have this specimen in your house and just observe its behavior is just just like an amazing thing why'd you get rid of it i didn't have i guess the right minerals in the mix it died it had a problem molting once yeah it couldn't mold correctly wow you miss it think about it still i do think about it to be honest i still have a pair of its a punching appendages from when it molted what pet animal in your life do you miss the most that has been in your life that you think about i've never had cats or dogs growing up or anything like that which you know i oh god my problem is here we go if i like something mhmm i will go down a rabbit hole mhmm yeah so i know if i got one tattoo i already know my first five are gonna be okay so i can't do it because then once i get those five it's gonna be a hundred and i'm already too old to be the tattoo guy what would be the first tattoo my face would it go on your ass cheeks or where would you put them that's like if it was my face if i got your face it would definitely be on my our right ear if you had multiple faces would you put like i think delts right shoulders different faces and different shoulders and then when you symmetry yeah yeah would you get a dictator if you if you had to get a dictator who would you get we have to be kim jong il right because i wrote the book on him oh it's like the plugging your book i don't like the plugging it's just like i have a personal connection to this stuff opener to this conversation we would be asking why him and he'd be like well i wrote a book about it well i'd be like oh okay okay here here's what check it out that would be a bad oh no that's not what happens okay here's the thing what happens when you write a book about north hey nice to meet you what is it you do i'm an author what kind of books do you write well my last book was on north korea yeah ninety percent of the time ninety they will then start telling me everything they know about north korea and it's like i don't need this isn't a quiz and it's a very poorly understood country i don't expect you to know anything you're not on the spot and and half what you're saying is not accurate either it's fine how often did they bring up dennis rodman hundred percent hundred percent of the time oh so you don't do you know dennis rodman yeah but i don't understand what i guess people feel the need to like alright like now we're talking about the subject i just gotta you know drop whatever i can talk about it's usually a small amount and there's this thing in the culture which i hate that everyone have to have an opinion on everything and it's like it's okay to be like yeah i don't know anything about that tell me more you know there's lots of things i don't know anything about what's your opinion on my bird here mister parrot it's macaw scarlet macaw what it is a scarlet macaw oh you know birds yeah and that's actually not life-sized are you saying he's not real i was saying it's not to scale okay but he's real are we doing that monty python sketch everything is a monty python sketch i don't think monty python's funny and i you don't at all like not that explains so much does it what does it explain what do you think is funny but you're not answering that question it's pretty funny well yeah what what what do you think is funny having a metta shrimp no you think bigelowoski is funny oh god no although this is getting worse and worse to be fair yep i only tried to watch big lebowski after it's been part of the culture for many years right to the point where every single line has been quoted incessantly by the most annoying frat bros ever yeah so i kind of have been poisoned to be able to appreciate it right so maybe if i'd seen it when it came out before it became a thing i would have enjoyed it i couldn't get through it like i couldn't get through twenty minutes is that how you feel about schindler's list well it's so much easier for me to stare at you when you have sunglasses on i didn't think you'd be the one making holocaust jokes today and yet here we are and cutscene i actually have like no trouble making eye contact with you when you're wearing shades yes because you're a robot two two copies of myself yeah oh you're seeing yourself in them mhmm okay cool yeah i'm having a conversation with myself it's not your fault lex they made you like this you were just a good little robot in in saint petersburg i could see mister parrot a little bit too but what do you find funny come on let let's this is an interesting subject well i find monty python i find absurdity funny yes i find absurdity funny i i think that's the thing when people come at me and maybe this is an eastern european thing yeah when they're like how can you find this like very dark subject funny it's like well the humor first of all the humor is that you're making fun of something that's dark so already it's absurd like it's completely inappropriate second just psychologically you know joan rivers said that winston churchill said i don't i don't know if it's true that when you make people laugh you're giving them a little vacation mhmm and i was just thinking about this the other day how when i die if i want my funeral to be a roast yeah it doesn't help me that everyone's sad if i brought people happiness or joy in life whatever i wanna keep doing that in death your sadness doesn't help me i i know you can't help it but tell stories how it made you laugh make fun of me make me the punching bag even literally take me out of that coffin and be the i don't make me pinata i don't care mhmm so i i think and it it's it's i don't understand well i do understand but it's sad for me when people are like you know this isn't funny that isn't funny i the way i look at humor is the way it's like a chef right it's pretty easy to make bacon taste good but some of these really obscure ingredients to make it palatable that takes skill so if you're dealing with a subject that is very emotional or intense and you can make people laugh then that takes skill and that's the relief for them yeah it's all about timing yeah yeah what's the different you wanna hear one of my jokes is it a pirate joke because that's the only that's the only kind i accept today but yeah go ahead it doesn't have to be a pirate joke this one time do you know who lia thomas is yeah what's there between lia thomas and hitler what what lia thomas knows how to finish a race very nice very nice did i just get the gold medal good job why does it take pirates forever to get through the alphabet why because they spent years at sea oh i thought it's gonna be an r joke that's a good one i like that yeah when i was in north korea oh you know dennis rodman it's a callback by the way the thing that is very heartbreaking about the north korean situation is that they have a great sense of humor it would be a lot easier if these were like robots or drones they have big personalities big senses of humor and that made it much harder to leave and interact with these people because it it's i mean there's nothing more human and universal than than laughter and laughter is free are you saying there's humor even amongst the people that have most of their freedoms taken away especially i mean again we're from you know the soviet union like there's a there's a i mean russian humor is a thing because it's there's nothing you can this if you can't have food or nice things at least you can have joy and make each other laugh i think about it all the time and i think about my guide all the time it's been what twenty twelve so it's been eleven years since i've been there and she's still there and everyone i've seen is still there they just recently electrified the border so you can't even even the few people who are escaping can't do it anymore but that's interesting that they still have a sense of humor i attribute the soviet union for having that because of the like really deep education system like you you got to read a lot of literature okay and because of that you get to kinda learn about the the cruelty the injustices the absurdity of the world right as long as the writing is not about the current regime yeah but i think like if you look at like african americans jewish americans gay americans they are all disproportionate in terms of attributing to comedy it's not because these groups have some kind of you know magic to them it's that when you are on the outside looking in a you're gonna have different perspective than the people who are in the middle of the bell curve but also when you don't have anything to lose at the very least you can make each other laugh and and find happiness that way so you know that is something that i think is an important thing to recognize so what do you find funny what makes you giggle like in the most joyful ways the suffering of others i mean i there are youtube videos of of like fat people falling down and they're they're they're really funny there's two kinds of people in this world those that laugh at those videos and those that don't no and those that are in them my friend jesse just told me a great norm macdonald joke mhmm and this is a good litmus test joke because he says a certain group of people lose their minds and a certain group of people just stare at you mhmm and he goes this kinda and so i'll tell you the joke this is norm mcdonald guy walks into a bar and he sees someone at the bar who has a big pumpkin for a head mhmm and the guy's like dude what happened to you he goes ugh you never believe this i got one of those genie lamps and this genie he's like what what happened he goes well the first wish you know i wish for a hundred million dollars he's like yeah you got it he goes yeah you know he goes in my bank account feels fine he goes alright well the second wish i wish to have sex with as many beautiful women as i want he goes did that happen he goes yeah it was amazing he goes then what well i wish for a giant pumpkin head yeah so there's a certain mindset that will just be staring at the screen mhmm and that is i mean there's so many levels why that's funny at least to me and i i just love that kind of well norm macdonald is like just i watch his videos all the time he's he's a guy that definitely makes me giggle and he's one of the people that makes me giggle for reasons i don't quite understand did you ever see him with carrot top on conan o'brien no of making fun of carrot top no he this is probably the best talk show clip of all time yeah he's on with courtney thorne smith she was on melrose place and conan o'brien's the host and courtney is talking about how she's gonna be an upcoming movie with carrot top and conan is like oh what's it gonna be called and she's like doesn't have a title yet and norman goes oh i know what it should be called box office poison and they're all laughing and she's like no no no like the working title is chairman of the board and conan goes do something with that smart ass and norm goes yeah board is spelled b o r e d and they all just completely lost it there's something about him with words spoken out of his mouth with the way he like turns his head and looks at the camera i think he is one of those rare comedians who you really feel like he's talking to you directly yeah he feels like he's winking at you yeah in the audience and he's like can you can you believe i'm doing this like it's it's like he almost he feels like he's i don't wanna say imposter but like he's more a member of the audience than he is a member of the people on the stage yeah it feels like he's on our side yes yeah whatever the hell our means you know roseanne got him his first job man roseanne you and herb been hanging out i got it oh my god talk about thanksgiving when you are talking to roseanne barr mhmm and making eye contact with this person it is i i can't even describe it it's just like holy crap roseanne barr is talking to me she is i've said this to her face pathologically funny like it does not turn off and you're sitting there and you're like holy crap and when you make her laugh which is that laugh that's in the theme song of her show you you feel like okay i did a mitzvah i did something good and right in the world that i made roseanne barr laugh and it's also really funny because and she's gonna hate this because i tell her she's adorable she isn't like that she's little you think of roseanne barr as this like force of nature like a tsunami yeah she's like five three i'd say like maybe one thirty like and she's just and she puts on the sunglasses you think this little old jewish lady you'd never know this is one of the most epic performers of all time she lives near here now so it's just so much fun talking to her there's an old satirical magazine in the i think in like early two thousands called heb mhmm written written by jews and she dressed up as hitler for one of the photoshoots and she was baking little nan in the oven oh i got i found it on ebay i want her to sign it to michael it should've been you yeah but she signed it to michael your one smart cookie and now it hangs love mom roseanne barr and i call her mom and it hangs over my desk because i have her like good domestic goddess energy flowing at me what what do you find what else so norman mcdonald norman mcdonald yes my favorite comedian is we agree on something my favorite comedian of all time is neil hamburger so neil hamburger i don't know if i'm brewing the bit he's a character performed by this guy named gregg turkington so he comes out in a tuxedo big eyeglasses holding three glasses of water mhmm coughing into the mic mhmm and i remember i saw him once in la and the girl ahead of me at the table ahead of me was with her boyfriend this basic chick pumpkin spice she turns to him and she goes what is this and i remember the first time he was on jimmy kimmel and he tells one of his jokes and he was like why does et like reese's pieces so much well that's what sperm tastes like on his home planet and like no one laughs and he goes oh come on guys i have cancer and it just cuts to this marine of the audience with his arms crossed so if you know what he's doing yeah it's just absolutely amazing he opened for tenacious d once in somewhere i think in ireland or the uk one of those and they're booing him because his jokes are often not funny he's like hey where did my whore ex wife run off to with that dentist she's shacking up with i don't know but when i see her in court next month alaska so they're booing and he goes alright do you guys want me to bring out tenacious d they're like yeah do you wanna see your heroes of mine tenacious d yeah come on let me hear it do you wanna see tenacious d and he goes alright if i tell this next joke and you don't boo me i'll bring out tenacious d and it's like i'm trying to think of one that's not too cell censorship is never good okay he goes can we agree that george bush is the worst president america's ever had and from collapse he goes which makes it all the stranger that his son george w bush was in fact the best i take it back in the cell phones and shit down so two people laugh and he goes oh that's amazing i guess i'll do an encore and he did ten more minutes it was just just like i love him so much it's interesting they opened for tenacious d jack black that's a comedic genius of a different kind oh yeah and he was in one of my favorite movies jesus' son it's this little indie movie he did a great turn in that he's really underrated as an actor he's got a lot of range like i know they kinda kinda get types cast as this kinda one specific type but he's really really talented but also just like the pure joy yes and then he's clearly having fun okay it is thanksgiving so in a tradition following tradition what are you thankful for michael in this world do you have a list too no not really really it's up in here oh i mean but you have several things you're thankful for yes okay yes one of the things i'm my list comes from the heart i don't have to write anything down well well i don't have written down okay one of the things that i'm most thankful for this is a common answer but i i can back it up is my family because my nephew lucas is now six years old and he when kids have a sense of humor it's like just miraculous so he stole my sister's phone his mom figured out that grandma is listed as mom in the phone and he calls her up and he's like michael's in the hospital he's really sick he didn't wanna tell you and she's freaking out he goes prank so i i took him dinesh d'souza just released a movie called police state which is actually really good highly recommend it i was surprised how much i liked it the because he wasn't going republicans good democrats bad it was just about authoritarianism and he had a movie premiere at mar a lago so i'm like i gotta bring lucas to mar a lago so lucas is i'm like we're going to the president's house he's like oh the white house and i'm like no no like a former president goes oh abel lincoln and i'm like okay kid logic like he's he's giving logical answers this is kinda like ai you have to you have to program it to it's using logic correctly mhmm you should have told him as a president that's second to only abe lincoln in terms of a great question yeah he went up to all the women in their ball gown you know evening gowns and he goes you're so beautiful were you born as a girl so when you have this six year old asking you this it was really really fun so that is a great joy to have a nephew and i have another one zach who's coming up in age and he's starting to talk now that is really really fun get getting to watch them you know find out about about the world for the first time and also training them like that he he want he loves being funny and having fun you're you're his audience in a in a sense yeah but because you giggle and i i i can we're prank bros he gives me a high five my family and this is one you talk about what i find funny this is the things that actually enrage me when people and this is such a wasp thing don't just go with the joke or they're like i don't get it or they don't understand to just go with it i was in the car with my sister when she was like ten twelve whatever she's much younger than me she's like twelve years younger and there's this species of squid by the way which is asymmetric one of its eyes is very much bigger than the other because it swims horizontally and so one's looking up one's looking down where there's more light shout out if you wanna learn more about squids go to octo nation dot com octonation shout out shout out to warren there's a lot of fascinating stuff octonation on instagram yes i was in the car with my sister she's like ten or fifteen as a pirate i don't i'm sorry for the rude interruptions i i appreciate that account especially yeah it's a great yeah these jokes and thoughts are coming to me at a like a ten second delay so i apologize anyway you were telling about the asymmetrical story alright so i tell my times you need help no the age is getting to you i was your skin is showing it it's getting dark i told my sister i go when you were born one of your eyes was bigger than the other and you had to have surgery to fix it so she turned she's like mom and my mom goes honey the important thing is that you're beautiful now that's all it's like what's the big deal it was just a little surgery and my sister's like alright calls grandma and grandma goes she goes michael said that while i was born in the eyes she goes why is he telling you this now it's not a big deal you were so the fact that everyone went with this oh was i was so impressed i was like this is a quality family in this very specific regard yeah does your family have a sense of humor yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know soviet culture there's like a dark sense of humor very much so wit there's wordplay wordplay yeah yeah especially the russian language allows for some like yes hilarity to it there's also a culture of like poetry and like my dad my mom too but they they remember a lot of lines from books and poems so there's just you can do a lot of fascinating references that add to the humor and the richness of the of the like that's a very russian thing like at a party or maybe at a bar or something i don't know where you'd meet people these are such great ice go out i meant in russia i meant these would be such good icebreakers right you go up to someone and goes hey did you hear this one and you just tell him some little story did you say icebreakers because it's cold in russia i'm here all night that's where you never leave town so i feel like that's a thing yeah and that's not a thing in america you you mean like witty banter no meaning you go up to a stranger and like that's your icebreaker you tell them this little little joke and since everyone kinda has the same sensibilities right away you guys are chatting i don't think that's a thing here yeah thing here it's more small talk which drives me crazy so what else are you thankful for well what do i what's something you're thankful for well you went for family i'm definitely thankful for family okay yeah how if i may ask how do they react to you like you're sitting down with elon you're sitting down with netanyahu you're sitting out with all these like big with kanye all these big names are they expressing that they're proud of you or is it more like why haven't you talked to this person yeah more michael malice please the people's choice yeah yeah they're they're very proud they've been very they're very i mean but they get argumentative when we just they're just like a regular human being with whom i'm close and we just argue about stuff they're not maybe not enough showed up being proud of but that that part is just the nature of our relationship it's also soviet parents yeah i don't talk to my dad that's one of the reasons because there's never ever any good job and at a certain point it's like why am i trying to search search for approval from someone i'm never getting it for and from from who wouldn't mean anything at this point anyway well that's interesting i mean there's a journey like that for a lot of people with their father or with their mother like they're always trying to find approval right and that that's life for a lot of people yeah that's that's a really big part of the human condition is that relationship you have with your father with your mother i don't know it's a beautiful thing so it's whether it's been a rough childhood or a beautiful one all of it that's who you are like that the relationship especially early on in your life with your father with your mother is like extremely formative yeah so my dad taught me a lot of things at a young age that i'm very very grateful for he was he's extremely intelligent very flawed and that's fine we all are except for me and it's the kind of things that when you learn things that are right a and this is one of the things i like about being older is that when i'm friends much older much older when i but much much older when i have friends who are younger it's very easy for me to keep them from making the mistakes i did mhmm so at least this is something i'm getting out of it is that okay i can't fix these mistakes but it just takes me thirty seconds and i can pull you back from making the mistake so he taught me a lot as a kid he really encouraged me very much to he's a very good sense of humor and also very bad in some ways dad jokes but also really funny jokes but also this love of learning that i got that from him and i mean i i have got literally right now ninety eight books on my shelf to read it's just a life and that makes me i remember i had a friend and she ran into someone she went to high school with and he stopped you on the train and he's like yo you're not in college you need to read books anymore and i was just like horrified to hear this yeah yeah boy don't i know it i mean i mean i i you do laugh but like i i when you got there's a lot of things i don't understand when you got heat for like i wanna read the western classics to me that that might have been like the internet at its absolute worst i think i think there's just a cynical perspective you can take that there this is such a simple celebration of a thing that there must be something behind it i think the internet for good and bad is just skeptical like what's behind this my hero albert camus and if there's one thing i would wanna fight it's cynicism yeah because it's such a giving up it's such everything sucks this sucks that's like this sucks most things suck most standard comedians suck most movies suck all podcasts suck but it doesn't especially yours especially mine it's it's unwatchable you're welcome you can't even spell it correctly but the stuff that's good is what matters there who cares if ninety percent of movies are terrible like they're the ones that change your life the books the people the the the comedians the shows the music and even the terrible things have good moments beautiful moments some not all your podcast being an example of not all i've literally just i keep listening for something good you something good in all fairness none of my guests have anything to offer it's not on me i try yeah yeah well i wish you talk a little less in your podcast it's a little excessive i only listen for the underwear commercials she's underwear dot com protocol malice i think you did this i haven't seen you do it in a while but this kinda commentary on a on a debate or i think it was with rand like an ayn rand debate or something malice at the movies i watched the video and and i broke it down that was really great i wish you did that more i've i haven't done live streaming in a long time i it was something i was doing a lot in new york especially during covid i feel that i don't know i'm having i got so many projects on the plate i'm oh this is something else i'm thankful for this is something i'm very very thankful for and i'm i'm gonna announce it here coming out of the closet finally go ahead who's the lucky guy you're the one in drag he's out guns out he makes me sleeves off he makes me call him sex freedmen you like it so i i didn't say it alright didn't even imply that when i in as you probably know as you know but as many people watching this also know harvey pekar who had the comic book series american splendor was the subject of movie american splendor he wrote a graphic novel about me in two thousand six called ego and hubris which goes for like hundred and fifty dollars on on ebay it's not worth it just download it and i met harvey because i wrote this screenplay about this band from the eighties called rubber rodeo it's a real band and the keyboardist gary lieb who passed away rest in peace gary introduced me to harvey because he did the animation for the movie and the script's been in my desk for over twenty years and i realized thanks to my buddy eric july who has some huge success with his comics i could just produce this as a graphic novel so i've got an artist mhmm we're getting it together so i'm gonna make it happen finally and it's some of the best writing i've ever done i'm really proud of the story it's kind of ironic reading it now because when you're a writer obviously different books you put different aspects of yourself into them right and this story is very very dark because basically they did all the right things and they went nowhere right but what i realized was reading it now that all these fears i had over twenty years ago about what if i'm not gonna make it what if you know i'm doing all the hard work and it's still not enough now it's been disproven because i can at least pay my rent you feel you've like you've made it so you said you could pay your rent i feel that to make it is if you can pay your if you don't have to have a boss mhmm and you know how i really felt like i made it mhmm this is gonna sound like a joke and it's not this is being an immigrant i own as you know margaret thatcher's bookcases yes so to me as an immigrant to have her bookcases in my house i've made it you're right it's not a joke it's not it's not there's nothing funny about it at all no what top dude's serious oh nice oh now i'm more nervous and aroused so what else are you thankful for so we're both thankful for family you i mean i'm the fact that i can they'll get it up what's that nothing go ahead i think as an author mhmm to be able to write what you want and have of enough an audience that it covers your living that's as good as it gets as an author almost you don't need to be stephen king or some legend it's like you know there's lots of stand ups who aren't like world famous but yeah they they have perfectly good living they do their gig they'll do what they love i i feel very very blessed you must be thankful for your career yeah yeah career wise but like i think the best part about it is just meeting making friends okay with people i admire okay quite honestly just friends i you know the people have gotten to know me i hide from the world sometimes i hit some low points especially with this new all the new experiences and just the people that have been there for me and haven't given up on me you know there's days and i'm sure you had this also where like i literally don't speak to someone the whole day mhmm and in certain times of my life it's really i i remember very vividly i i was in dc in ninety seven i was an intern and that summer dc closes down on the weekends and i remember those weekends when like i got off the phone with like the third person i knew there was no possibility anyone was gonna call and what that felt like and it was dark and it was bad so i i remember that those feelings of loneliness like a lot i still feel alone like that sometimes you don't feel you don't feel alone not anymore what's the what's the reason you think i because there's like i have a lot of people who i care about who care about me i i mean the thing about moving to austin is i forgot how lonely new york got because it was like one after another i lost everybody and a certain and then you start losing the places you go to and then it was just like holy crap i'm very isolated and here in austin there's not as much to do obviously as in new york but there's a lot of people here more people are coming all the time so if i ever want to like hang out with someone you know i've got a long list and these are people who i've known for a very long time people who know me quite well so i could be myself my awful awful awful awful awful self and that is something i don't take lightly now you moved to texas it's gonna secede yeah it's just a very do you know what happened with that no i forgot the guys in the amen it's probably for the best monday on monday a guy in the texas legislature introduces a bill to have it on the referendum to have a referendum for texas to declare its independence mhmm tuesday aman rogan me and him discuss it i give it national attention it was also really funny because a lot of people like these people have been in texas five minutes blah blah i go to the texas legislature meet with the guy have a nice conversation month or two later unanimous i think he gets voted kicked out of congress because he got an intern drunk and was inappropriate with her and at least it was the girl in this case but yeah so it's like that was my little texas independence moment oh it didn't go anywhere it did not go anywhere wow but it's still part of the platform the texas republican party yeah it's fascinating that history is probably laden with stories like this of failed revolutionaries we celebrate the heroes but then there's the losers like myself yeah yeah and we're gonna mark that one as a failure and edit it out and moving on so thankful yeah friendships right but by the way i wanna say just to you i'm thankful in this lonely moments for people who write books i've been listening to audiobooks a lot and reading a lot i really like audiobooks actually and just like i don't know i can just name random person serhiy plow he's a historian i'm reading on the wait i read him what do you what do you i just see he written a book most recently about the russia ukraine war he wrote another one that i read didn't he write empire's i think the fall of the soviet union or something like that yeah yeah yeah it was very very good he's great i used him as a resource for the white pill he's objective while still having emotion and feeling to it like he has a bias that's fine but without well a lot of times when you write a story that involves putin people are really ideological yeah they don't really like they don't write with a calmness and the clarity and the rigor of history there's emotion in it like there's almost a virtue signaling yeah and he he doesn't have that even though he is ukrainian and has very strong opinions on the matter anyway there's people like that and he's done an incredible job researching a recent event like he says i was looking at everything that's been written about the war in ukraine and realizing you know the whole churchill line that historians are the worst ones to write about current events except everybody else and so he's like i i might as well just write about this war and he does an exceptional job summarizing day by day the details of this this war anyway so i'm just grateful for a guy like that so for me there's i'll i'll name some historians i love arthur herman mhmm victor sebastian is is probably my favorite david pietrusza p i e t r u s z a when you are a historian and i tried to do this to some degree in the white pill as far as i could but yeah when you take data and you make it read like a novel this so you're learning about who we are as people what had happened but also it's entertaining and readable that to me is like the acme of writing and i have so much admiration what does acme mean top okay zenith zenith okay this is what writers do they just come up with these incredibly sophisticated words i'm impressed well acme you could've just said the best of writing acme is also the company in like bugs bunny and wile e coyote so it's acme stew you know acme yeah yeah like acme bombs mhmm when they are that good it's it's just it just i it leaves me in awe that's just the ron scharnow is another one who he wrote the hamilton biography oh nice oh i i i have a lot of favorite historians about the whole time period of world war two with shire people that lived during it especially i really like those accounts obviously solzhenitsyn is he's not a historian but his accounts are sure fascinating you actually how how much do you talk about solzhenitsyn no never not much right why not i feel like i wanted to i i there's something i could add to him oh he's he's the michael malice of previous century no he's talented charismatic and and skilled so he's not the michael malice yeah i i did not i feel like i didn't i didn't i didn't read gulag archipelago for the white pill i feel you didn't i didn't no i feel i got a lot of it from anne applebaum who's a very controversial figure her history books on the soviet union i think are superb but she's also accused of being very much like a neo con and being a warmonger in contemporary times oh i see and i think comparisons between putin and stalin although there is a venn diagram i i think are a bit much because i i think it's very hard to claim that you know if putin conquered ukraine that there'd be a genocide yeah i don't think it i think that's a very hard argument to make in these tense times even the comparisons of what's going on in israel on either side comparisons to the holocaust are also troubling in this way yes and and i also don't like how that you know i got in trouble there was some literal demon who works at the atlantic as opposed to a regular demon as opposed to figurative demon i didn't know they employ demons they they exclusively employ demons at the atlantic and he was giving me crap just a couple years ago on twitter because i didn't think it's appropriate to refer to george soros as a holocaust survivor and i'm like listen if you wanna put him in the same context as anne frank knock yourself out but i think that's so completely disingenuous and and frankly repulsive to me morally to equivocate between figures like that and also the claim that anyone who is a billionaire who is including elon including sheldon adelson there's no shortage of these people if you wanna use your extreme wealth used to influence politics you have to be up for criticism and and to protect people bill gates to protecting these people from criticism just on the base of their identity is is deranged to me but also the holocaust as a historical event and the atrocities within it are just singular in history and so comparing them what's the utility right you're just you're just basically trying to take this brand i'm using that term in a in a very specific way and latch like when they say climate denial no one's denying climate exists so you're just trying to go off of holocaust denial i think it's shameless and i think it's it's it's gross and it cheapens everything yeah because there's deep important lessons about the holocaust yes to me the lessons are about how extreme it can get and how fast yeah and how fast that's the one so you know people ask oh are humans basically good are they basically evil i always say they're basically animals and i think people are most people are almost fundamentally deranged and that there's basically this veneer of civilization and decency and when shit hits the fan and we see this over and over they do things that would have been completely unthinkable even to themselves five years ago most people are fundamentally deranged with a veneer of civility there's a show called i think i disagree with that what was the show called i'm having alzheimer's because of the advanced age the skate maker there's a schist there's a show called i think you should leave it's a sketch comedy show okay sorry it's a sketch comedy show and he captures these great how's your hair princess mhmm he captures these great moments of just the like just the very thin veneer of normalcy mhmm and just the craziness that's so frequently lurking underneath another great example of this when this is dealing with people who are literally crazy have you ever seen the show hoarders so every episode of hoarders every there's two usually two people in every episode but every episode has the same plot line veneer of normalcy veneer of normalcy veneer of normalcy slight expression of concern full blown derangement mhmm and it always follows that exact pattern yeah i don't know i think the deep ocean of the human mind is is good like there's a longing to be good to others i have seen literally no evidence of this and i know everything's a deep ocean with you people but like what do you mean you people pirates oh i don't see it you you is that mister parrot you an anti semite no that's not nice to say in front of such a large audience you're embarrassing me mister parrot lex you have is that mister parrot you you have he's he's a run of the mill troll and barely an intellectual that's not nice to say that's not true we talked about this you have to see the good in people you have seen personally yep how quickly and easily it is for human beings to form out groups yeah and to just read others just as i just did a minute ago with the atlantic completely out of the human race and that happens constantly and very easily humans are tribal beings so that does not i don't see how that's compatible with this essential desire to do good no i i think it's like in nineteen eighty four for the two minutes of hate there is a part of humans that wants to be tribal yep and wants to direct get angry and hateful and then that hate is easy to direct yes by especially people as you as an anarchist talk about other people in power that can direct that anger but i think if you just look at recent human history the desire for good the communal desire for good outweighs that i think like most of life on earth right now people are being good to each other in in a in a most fundamental sense relative to how nature usually works i i okay i think you're both wrong about people and about nature so nature is not inherently violent in the sense like for example if anyone has an aquarium or if you look at wildlife yeah you're gonna have predator prey but these animals are gonna be coexisting and they're gonna be ignoring each other for the most part mhmm right and as for humans you know being essentially good i think humans are essentially to each other you said i think they're essentially civil and amiable but that's not really being good good i think is a thing that gets illustrated when you're challenged when there's a difficult situation going on i mean civility is a good starting point and then when there's a big challenge that comes people step up on average i completely agree with you that human beings are capable of such profound goodness that it kinda makes you extremely emotional and i i certainly think that that's true but i think that that's more unusual than is the norm i see beauty everywhere so do i but that doesn't mean it's in every person not in every person but in most people i think i mean i wish there was a really good way to measure this my general sense of the world is just there's so much incredible both in terms of economics in terms of art in terms of just creation as as a whole that's happened over the past century it feels like the good is outpouring the bad you just did the perfect segue mhmm to the box what's in the box so is it your fragile ego that's my you stole my joke you stole my joke that was the joke i made at you before we recorded you stole my joke no i did i i write you all your material you hack so as you know i have a lot of beautiful stuff in my house because i think it's something very important everyone listening if you accomplish something that is great some achievement what i like to do is buy myself something to remember that moment because sometimes when it's hard you forget you've done great things in your life you've had accomplishments doesn't have to be some amazing factory it could just be like my first job where i got a raise or you know what i i anything so there's this amazing sculptor named jake michael singer a singer who's a sculptor and i saw a piece of his how's his singing voice this is joke song i i i do want i could go somewhere with this okay how's his singing voice do you want me to write your joke for you yeah what's the punchline hard there it is that's that's what she said so i followed him on instagram he followed me back mhmm and he's like if i made he says what's the point of being an artist if this work i create isn't in the spaces of people i like and admire he's a big fan of yours you've given him and our episodes together give him joy so he said if i get a make lex a sculpture will he put on the shelf behind him and what that reminded me of is when i was a kid you read batman comics and there's the bat cave and the bat cave has all this cool stuff in it i didn't realize until much later that all of those things in the bat cave had an origin story so the giant penny the dinosaur there was actually a story where that came from so if you're a fan of a show you can spot oh this is when this appeared this is when that appeared this is when that appeared so he made you this sculpture he lives in turkey and it's called chance murmur and it is i haven't even seen it yet it is absolutely beautiful i just so you wanna do a little unboxing yes okay axe or body spray alright let's unbox i'm so excited eli is out of box you know that steven seagal movie where there's like a stripper that comes out of the box is that under siege okay he's on a boat you're not an action film guy no one what does the pirate say when he turns eighty what i matey i matey oh oh see that's how i know you don't like humor i just don't like pirates well your mom does do you play any musical instruments paul nope neither do you i've seen your guitar videos okay here's a big piece of wood for you that's what it feels like just so you know oh wow yep oh my god just traveled across the world so here's why his work speaks so much to me so first of all he's combining so many different references it's nike the goddess of victory right it's that it looks like an angel as well the italian futurists which is my favorite art movement from the early twentieth century they tried to capture motion in two d or three d form well jake thank you thank you thank you thank you for creating beautiful things and i thank you for caring about somebody like me and somebody like michael i really feel the love that's the other thing thank you when you have something that matters to you in your house and you're having a bad day you can look at it and remember you know what i mean that spirit of joy and i actually have a list here mhmm okay i got a little rant ready you wanna hear my rant yeah let's go you're you're one of the things that drives me crazy is when people especially conservatives think that all contemporary art is ugly or abstract or like literally garbage mhmm and there's a lot of that but so much of the stuff out there in galleries is not only not crazy expensive but they're trying to sell things for people in their house and these are young artists you know they're trying to add beauty i have a list so if you don't believe me and you think all contemporary art is garbage or terrible go to the website or any of these places that i'm gonna rattle off mhmm look through them and you're telling me that that it's not about creating beauty and joy in things in people's lives so i don't have any relationship with any of these people these are just some galleries i follow on instagram outre gallery antler gallery giant robot two beinart i don't know how to pronounce it i'm sorry b a b e i n a r t spoke art gallery var gallery in milwaukee i was there mhmm the pieces were not expensive at all what kind of art are we talking about everything mostly paintings mostly paintings some sculptures too like this corey halford is my favorite one in la night gallery vertical gallery avant gallery hive gallery haven gallery and curio art gallery i'm telling you it's not exorbitant this is not the kind of thing where you have to go to a museum and be like this doesn't make sense to me you look at it right away you're like okay i know what this is and it's beautiful it's awesome and you're supporting someone who's young and creative trying to do something and make the world a better place so i'm a big fan of the contemporary art scene a lot of it is not great but even the stuff that's not great is very rarely disgusting or gross it's just like okay i've seen this before or something like that okay so there's there's it's like a difference between there's like a stand up where like i'll pay money for the ticket and someone's like who's an opener it's like i wouldn't pay to see him perform but he sure still made me laugh that person is still more by far more good than bad so a lot of this art is in stuff i would own but it's like okay i get it i like it well as the analogy goes i i really like going to open mics actually because like fun it sounds absurd to say but funny isn't the only thing that's beautiful about stand up comedy it's the act the act the it's it's going for it it's trying to be funny it's taking the leap trying the joke and some of the best stuff is actually funny but the audience is like three people two of whom are drunk and bored and you're still going for it and that's like that's the human spirit right there roseanne was telling me how gilbert gottfried go on it was like three in the morning and it was like five her and like three other comics in the audience and like they all were just dying like he was just killing them who's your favorite comedian dave smith who and cutscene favorite comedian but first norman mcdonald if you like put a gun to my head and had to answer really quickly that would be him okay i would also say louis ck oh wow yeah oh my god yeah but that's almost like a vanilla answer at this moment in in history because it's like louis ck is pretty radioactive he is well yeah he does it the tough topics sure the best mitch hedberg the wit of a a good one liner is great i guess that's what no mcdonald's genius at what about you there's a i mean we're so fortunate to be here in austin because that company mother ship you go there and like people are just killing it david lucas is amazing ty rivera ty rivera probably did the best set i've seen since i've been here in austin and i i watched him and i'm like this guy's even like even bitchier than i am so i reached out to him so he's just terrific david lucas is another one a buddy of mine you just said a choice i think i'm thinking dave landau excuse me yeah dave landau joe maddox is age is touching up it's true though it's true it's true it's true dave lucas you ever been to the comedy mothership it's a great it's a great spot where is that is that in austin austin is that where willie nelson is from i haven't really go ahead oh i heard a joke about that the other week what's the tell the tell the joke again what's the only thing worse than giving head to willie nelson what if he says i'm not willie nelson what's that mister parrot i know he's not funny he's better he's he thinks he's better on twitter that's not nice to say right in front of his face just think how he feels the the statue's chance murmur is judging you chance it's called chance murmur chance murmur god that's so beautiful that's gorgeous this is that's another reason i hate cynicism and i talk about this a lot even just on etsy there are so many small not huge companies like individual artisans who are creating great stuff and just making it happen and it's really sad for me where people can't see that or if they're like yeah well how could i be excited about a sculpture when blah blah blah the middle east and it's just like you can always look for an excuse not to look for joy yeah or you could look for an excuse to look for joy yeah etsy is incredible i i feel the same way but only fans only fans i can't even get that out of my mouth before laughing at my own failed joke that's what she said i did oh alright that might be one of the first that's what she said from a michael malice yeah i'm gonna count that i don't know what i'm gonna do with mine because i got my own mine's three feet tall just like me the box is much bigger yeah and it was giving me an inferiority complex uh-huh i think i'm gonna invade russia that's a napoleon reference for those in the audience i don't know if i'm gonna i think i'm gonna put in my bedroom because that's the first thing i see when i wake up put in the bedroom yeah do we get through everything we're thankful for no i've got lots of things i'm thankful for what else friends family who said books i'm thankful for career i'm thankful for i am thankful for and i know people are gonna lose their minds and i can hear them flipping out already mhmm i am thankful for social media yeah i'm thankful for several reasons first it is a way for people to make connections that they couldn't have made in years past that if you got some weird hobby you can find that other person's weird hobby and you make that connection it's a great way to stay in touch permanently for people otherwise you'd lose touch with you know whatever venue and it's also a great way to expose corporate depravity when you have these organizations that are dishonest i think the community notes thing on twitter is the greatest thing ever yeah it's incredible i wish they would pay it on the attention to michael malice account more often you shouldn't be encouraging anyone to pay attention to my twitter account yeah it's a dumpster fire and i and i don't mean bridget i mean like literal bridget fantasy bridget by the way is amazing but your she let her count makes yes not here i wish she did she's in georgetown no i mean in in this where we're sitting it's a joke michael is it yeah but i i'm just really glad about it's another way for people who before would have felt very alone i know it makes us some people do feel alone but for other people it makes them feel connected there's been a a lot of talk about antisemitism recently yeah what's what's your sense about this is there is anti semitism like any other brand of hate there's a lot of hate out there no i don't think it's like any other brand of hate because i don't think racists or transphobes or homophobes or misogynists or xenophobes argue openly or even not so openly for the killing of black americans transgender people gay people women or immigrants and it's not only something that's talked about it's something that has actually happened and not just the holocaust but just centuries of pilgrims right there's this great book that i read many years ago called the satanization of the jews camille paglia recommended it and i read it and they live in this this certain specific kind of antisemitism and i'd i'm again i'm not talking about people who are against israel or something i'm talking specifically about jew hatred they have this moral calculus that jews are the only people who are capable of good or evil and jews are exclusively capable of evil and for example if you look at the george w bush white house you had w you had cheney condoleezza rice colin powell donald rumsfeld a lot of these new new account advisers so if there's ten people in a room and there's one jewish person it's his fault and the rest are jew controlled so again they they only exist as a puppet of jews in this kind of worldview and it's like that to me if there were no jews on earth it is crazy to say that john bolton and liz cheney and lindsey graham wouldn't be pushing for more war that makes no sense to me it's like the you blame the jews when bad things happen but when a jewish person does some something good it doesn't really matter or just wait he's you know he's gonna do something bad well yeah that's true human beings do good things and then they do bad things sometimes but it only counts when that jewish person does the bad thing i wonder what's a way to fight antisemitism and fight hate in general i think the only or the best way because i thought a lot about this about how did gay americans go from being universally hated and despised to the point that many people in the eighties went to their graves those who had aids without even telling their parents because they were so scared to now times square mhmm is just covered in pride flags mhmm and i think and this this also works for islamophobia and some of these other bigotry is what i call the ambassador program because as soon as you know someone who is a member of a certain group it is a lot harder to be bigoted against them because instead of this being this out group that's somewhere out there it's like wait a minute i work with this guy yeah he's kind of a jerk and maybe he sees things a little differently than me but this guy is not a horrible human being so i think the only way to fight any form of bigotry is to be a good example of the counter to these whatever archetype or stereotype is in the culture karl marx wrote that religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature the heart of a heartless world and the soul of a soulless condition it is the opium of the people as the famous phrase goes do you think he has a point no i hate that quote i absolutely hate it mhmm i despise this sort of reddit internet atheist activism for the simple reason that i know many people who in finding faith have become objectively better human beings yeah i mean they start living consciously they take morality seriously they try we we all fail to be moral good people so this sneering that these midwits these marginally intelligent people have towards religious people now lots of religious people use religion to rationalize their bad behavior or you know sinful or big egos so on and so forth that exists that's true but to say that it never helps anyone and it's universally the see marx was talking about a period i mean i'll defend his quote when his argument was you know the masses are being starved and oppressed but they're promised you don't worry you'll have riches in heaven so you should kinda like let yourself be pushed around now and this is kind of this bs bargain that the people are being given so that was i think the point he was making it's not it certainly doesn't apply nowadays i i i have been close to the family in the midwest they're good christian people i remember very specifically this guy shout out to him sean sherrod i went to college with him david lucas and have you checked out the comedy mothership great great quote is it austin willie nelson and i you know i was seventeen eighteen freshman year and i was reading all this criticism of the bible and i was like look this is in there look at this in there and he put his hand on my shoulder and he says michael there's nothing you're gonna tell me that's going to make me lose my faith and that was a very self aware and profound thing to say as i've gotten older and i know lots of religious people there's no part of me that thinks they're wrong or they should be mocked it's like it it also reminds me of when people sneer at addicts in recovery they're like alcoholism is a disease it's a choice it's like wait a minute you don't know what it's like to have your entire life ruined by drugs or alcohol yeah and if you have to tell yourself you know i have this disease and blah blah blah and that keeps you from drinking and now you're a moral upstanding person who's reliable and and takes responsibility for their actions i i i don't see the harm at all so i i think this kind of activist atheism is cheap i i don't agree with it whatsoever and i i do not like that quote at all but otherwise big fan of marx i mean it's i i think there's a fan of mine i forget who it was apologies he had this great quote he goes the gay and this is me talking he goes the games people play to to feel smarter than others is depressing and annoying and i think this kind of fedora internet atheism is a good example because here's the other thing if you've proven that someone else is stupid that doesn't mean you're smart you could both be stupid mhmm so congrats you prove someone else is stupid who cares yeah been sneering at all forms yes in general is just not great that's one of the things i block out people on social media instantly you're not gonna sneer at me in my space you could steer me all you want in your space but i'm not putting up with your crap i don't know you myspace great social network is that on on six dot six six street aol dot com clang clang clang that's how lex comes like a pavlov's dog that was the sound before you get to see spend ten minutes waiting for an image of a lady load one line at a time yeah i recently talked to john mearsheimer i don't know if you know him at all so he has this idea about offensive realism it's a way to analyze the world international relations and the basic idea and i'll run it by you and see what you think is that states nations want to survive and they try to do so by maximizing power military power and he talks about anarchy quite a bit in that one of these underlying assumptions of this way of viewing the world is that states are anarchic towards each other yes that's true and they operate under a lot of uncertainty states cannot be sure that other states will not use military capabilities against them right they want to survive and they want to use military power to control the uncertainty to protect themselves so i i i disagree in that regard and i i see on your bookshelf i think the world is a lot closer to brave new world than it is to nineteen eighty four and i think it is if you look at let's suppose china's influence in america right mhmm the influence is far more through soft power than military power china doesn't threaten america through you know we're gonna kill you it's more like their infiltration of universities tiktok things of that nature maybe this would have worked before the pop culture era but i think one of the reasons we have this kind of american hegemony isn't just a function of american military i think it's much more a function of american popular culture when you're exporting ideas and culture it makes other people in other countries feel closer to you and also feel regard you as as a friend and also to adopt your value it's a great way to spread propaganda it seems to correlate though right it's interesting it's an interesting idea what has more power the viral spread of ideas or the the power of the military it it seems that united states is at the top of the world on both that's true and so it's hard to disentangle the two let's look at europe american culture is very popular in europe in many ways right mhmm like the best music comes out of sweden swedish indie pop they're singing in english you know even though so on and so forth none of this is a function maybe it's a function of post world war two to some extent but i don't think it's a function of american bases there i think it's a function of we're exporting our music our tv shows and our movies yeah it's interesting if the battleground will be brave new world the battle of ideas i think it's clearly brave new i i i i i'm it's so much cheaper and again this is one of the dark sides of social media to use influence than it is to use threats i don't think i think covid is a good example of this like so much of the pressure yes there was authoritarianism but it was the fact that everyone bought into it rightly or wrongly but the vast majority of the population was behind all of these things and that was through persuasion not because and because people are begging for it to come back in many cases mhmm so who's funding you which intelligence agency assad assad assad this is how you do great interviewing see he didn't even expect that okay what's that mister ferret what's that mister ferret you knew it but you didn't have any documentation did you i think mister ferret is threatened by the better better wings by chance remember he gets like that when he's turned on he's not threatened he can't wait until he's all three of us are alone together it's gonna be one hell of a party beaks and feathers everywhere and metal yeah this thing is beautiful it's ridiculous you have you have actually a lot of really cool stuff at your at your place so fun what what's a what's a cool thing that stands out to you maybe a recent addition so i went to the dallas museum of art last year for my birthday and there was a painting i liked mhmm and i googled it and i saw the auction for that exact painting and it was like i think three grand which is not cheap but not something you'd think you think in a museum i can never afford something like this right mhmm so when i was in i went to houston with some friends the side surfs natalie who made the cake of you cake terrified my mom this it did it yeah no it's not the cake that terrified my mom it's you michael melas cutting it off cutting the face off and laughing maniacally well natalie's pregnant she's gonna have a daughter named daisy so congrats to natalie congrats to natalie but i was in the museum with them and there was a statue of thoth who's the egyptian god whose head is an ibis it's a bird with a long beak and thoth is the god of the moon god of knowledge and supposedly he invented writing so i thought you know what i've always loved ancient egypt i know a lot about it and especially the mythology it'd be really cool as an aspiring author to have an ancient egyptian thoth statue in my house mhmm well it turned out that the egyptians also killed and mummified ibises and buried them with scribes and a week after i went to the museum there was an auction for an ibis mummy mhmm and i have it now in my house still in its bandages overlooking my desk and we all know it's gonna come to life and peck out my eyes yeah and write with my blood but that is one of the recent cool additions another thing i have which is like in terms of holy crap i've made it i have a an original patrick nagel painting and if people don't know the name he's like the eighties artist he did duran duran cover he we never see him in nail salons i have a male which were very rare for him to do so that's two of my kinda favorite uses what he only drew women predominantly i have one where we drew a male like a it's a guy in a like a gene ad or something and now i'm looking forward to so jake made me a three foot tall sculpture called future murmur which i am ecstatic to get just remind yourself of how many fascinating beautiful people there are out there and just the victory and and holiness and technology and speed and how many people have you know fought so that i could do what i do yeah that's another thing i'm grateful for just like the hundred billion or so people that came before us yeah and and also the trillions of life forms that came before that oh god i've gone down this this trilobite rabbit hole buying fossils because as a kid i thought trilobites were the coolest thing and i've got like fifteen yeah and what's interesting is when you buy trilobite fossils on ebay they're listed as used because it's gotta be new or used according to programming so it's used yeah yeah that but just look thinking about all that history just all the life forms that came before it seems like a really special thing we have gone on earth here oh yeah i i think that's that's very fair to say but i you also think this kinda is like live life to the fullest you know camus talked about living to the point of tears yeah especially on behalf of people who didn't have that privilege mhmm so you know i dedicated the white pill to my parents who got me out of the soviet union and all the kids who never could and it's like when i die i want everyone else to not only they're obviously gonna be happy but yeah like i'm not here enjoy what you you you live for me because i can't have that privilege anymore what do you think about camus as a writer i don't like his novels at all oh you don't at all yeah you've talked shit about the plague to me yeah i i didn't i i think the book is pointless it's fascinating because all you need to do is read the synopsis and then you get it like i don't think his book true for most books no i mean like you could take i i don't know i just don't wanna agree at all they're i mean it's it's sketcher in the rye there's a lot of books that are seem trivial i don't think it seems trivial but i think animal farm animal farm is a methodical step by step examination of a transformation from one thing to another the plague is not that it's a methodical examination of what a society is like under the plague which could symbolize a lot of things including the plague directly or nazi germany or ideological movements or it's it's similar to animal farm maybe not as effective in terms of using this kind of symbolic farm has a narrative and i'm gonna spoil the whole plague the book the plague okay there's a there's a town i believe in oman mhmm a plague descends people struggle to deal with it and the plague vanishes as quickly as it came the end yeah but there's the victims the the people that take advantage of it there's the doctor that amidst the absurdity and the evil of the plague is fighting to do good nothing for me there's nothing for me well i can spoil animal farm there's pigs there's animals at a farm and they the humans are abusing them and then the animals overthrow the humans but then the pigs become just like the humans it the lesson kids is that power corrupts no matter whether you walk on four or on two i thought the lesson was that pigs are the most human like animals on the farm i thought the i thought the lesson was that there's no sugarcane mountain that's right you've interviewed a lot of people yeah what have you learned about getting to the soul of a person the soul of an idea from interviewing just how to do a good interview first off i'm not interviewing just random people i'm i'm interviewing people who are accomplished it's not a random group that's self selecting for something different but i think that people love to and this is very understandable love to feel seen so if you're someone who's done something even if you're like the best guinea pig breeder in america to have someone interested in your work and ask and listen to what you're saying because i remember every book i've written you know i have friends that i wouldn't stop talking about you know the the the the person i'm writing with or you know the north korea at a certain point i'm sure they're like alright i don't i don't care about this anymore but like it takes over your brain you know what i mean so if you are someone who has an interest or a hobby i i'm sure to some extent maybe your friends or family are sick of talking about it or you don't wanna talk about it with them you wanna have that's the private life where you could just be yourself so i try to and this comes from my coauthoring background when i'm talking to people to ask questions that they haven't heard before there's a possibility that this actor i'm a huge fan of is gonna be on my show i don't wanna spoil everything and he's got a very specific role that he's known for and i know i'm gonna i'm like okay i'm gonna i know it's gonna be annoying for you talking about this one role but my goal is to ask questions that haven't you have aren't sick of ask asking mhmm of having been asked porn star or not not a porn star that joke failed also edit out what do you know about breeding guinea pigs you mentioned it i'd love to hear it i don't know anything i'd love to hear more about it this is i always use this as an example i said there's there's you you meet someone at a party who breeds guinea pigs right there's two approaches either you're weird get it okay or sit down and tell me everything yeah and i'm very much and all the people i like are are the second group mhmm when you meet someone who's doing something unusual and are passionate about it and you know are good at it like that to me is the mother lode yeah that to me also is the thing i enjoy the most it's like because because everyone's like passionate about it who do you guys hate do you guys hate the hamster people do you hate the rabbit people yeah there's gotta be someone that you guys look down on because because like the marine aquarium people look down the freshwater aquarium people yeah it's a hierarchy yes there's always gonna be a hierarchy this is where the left anarchists and i disagree because they think you could have egalitarianism there's gonna be a hierarchy hierarchies emerge yes there's no anarchy in the guinea pig world no it's just a different kind of anarchy somebody's always breeding somebody else yes and looking down on the others if someone's the other yeah whether it's the hamster people the rat people and everybody's breeding yeah by the way are you a anarcho capitalist what kind of what flavor of anarchist are you i'm an anarchist without adjectives i like them all the black flag comes in many colors alright alright you're quoting your yeah no i understand you it was it was a beautiful line in the book thank you mhmm i think the anarcho capitalists don't give the left anarchists enough credit especially for their courage and i do whatever i can in my power to talk about people like emma goldman whenever possible do you still think that are some people better than others is a good litmus test yes it's worked a hundred percent of the time and for you the answer is yes i never answered there's two of them there what are you getting all hitchcock up in here oh hey careful i always got your back what little habits in your life make you happy now that you're in austin oh my god i was prepping for this interview mhmm and i imagined this coming up mhmm and i knew that as i explained this you know how sometimes when someone tells a story like at first it's amusing then it's amusing and concerned and then you're like holy shit like like where's the exit yeah i'm getting nervous already you should so i'm going to tell you something i've told only a couple of people this is my absolutely mhmm off the charts autistic approach to shaving oh so i have this insane system you ask about habits that give me joy i used to hate shaving i used to hate it there's something called wet shaving mhmm so wet shaving is you get the brush mhmm you get the soap that's in a canister yes you stir it up you paint your face and then you shave the thing is there are dozens of these shaving soap companies yeah okay so i tried a couple of hundred of these soaps because you're testing for scent you're testing for what the lather thickness and also how smooth of a shave it gives you yep i have it down i'm i'm not making this up i'm not this creative i have it down to a cycle of sixty seven soaps yeah okay so this cycle a cycle so sixty seven yep when i use up one soap that is a slot that i will have to try new ones mhmm and i will try new ones in that slot until i get one that i like and then that slot is filled so right now i have sixty seven that i use and i have eighty six candidates like in the queue yeah in the in the queue do you label them do you remember like which one is which well they they all have beautiful labels i mean these are artists who are creating these amazing things so they're i would encourage everyone to try this hobby who's a guy it's so much fun i will give a shout outs to the companies that that are the best so the best company in my opinion is company called they just changed the name because you know what they're originally called i'm not joking yeah grooming department and now it's like not a bad name yeah but it has certain connotations in the different discourse so now he changed temporary discourse yes he changed his name to ion skincare a i o n that's the the sense of the most sophisticated the most diverse and the the soap is just really high quality mhmm another amazing company is barrister and mann and if i'm gonna tell you to try one it's called cheshire mhmm he comes out with new ones every month or so a lot of it's miss a lot of it's hit just great great quality stuff mhmm another great company is chiseled face they make something called midnight stag which basically smells like a garage it's one of my favorite soaps of all time yeah what what makes for a good smell for michael malouf i i have sixty seven answers so some of the can't smell into convert it to some are citrusy some are industrial some so garage is more industrial it's it smells like a garage yeah midnight stag it smells like a garage some are fun because there's smells that smell like other things for example there's a scent in my queue called finding scotty it smells like swedish fish oh another great company is phoenix shaving and they have one called aloha smackdown smells like hawaiian punch mhmm they had one called yule ham that they made for me special smells like a ham they had a ramen one rockin' ramen smells like cup of noodles mhmm so they're great and they every year they do an advent calendar where you for twelve days you have a little sample of a a soap and a sample of the aftershave nice so those are i'm i'm i'm forgetting someone and i'm feeling angry that i'm doing it but those are some of the oh and katie's bubbles is great they're vegan out of new jersey they've got one called knee hyto grape it smells like grape soda i think those are the biggest names off the top of my head will that list converge down to a small set eventually or no sixty seven down to well no it's it's down to it's sixty seven so oh so it's always keeps right so there's a slot then you know what i mean like i'll fill that you just see what i'm saying oh so you will forever have the variety of sixty seven yes you know you know what you know how sad my brain is when i when you were telling me this i was like i wonder how many soaps are left in michael mouse's life like you can count your life by days by months by years or by soaps that is depressing that is so dark because each each experience of shaving is a little beautiful experience yes it is and then how many do you have left in your life right that's true yeah i gotta tell you there's something else there's a term called my friend jackie taught me called touching pan it's a makeup term so basically when you use it and you could see the bottom mhmm that that's like a big moment oh it's a great thing yeah it's like well it's kind of fun i'm telling you like people can scoff it is such a fun and there's a lot of us online who are into this whole space it's really really fun when did you first discover this can i curse yeah fuck you cole striker mhmm because i was staying at my friend cole's house in la yeah fuck you cole fuck you cole cole is like one of the biggest hipsters i know he's got the the shirts with the pearl snaps and everything mhmm and i'm staying at his house because i was doing rogan and he goes oh have you heard of this wet shaving thing and he goes look this one's that's like the italian grandpa soap which is also a great one and i went down this rabbit hole and i'm like hun i don't even know how many how much money i spent on this and it's all because of him oh but it's like a happy fuck you like fuck you cole yeah you can i love you cole fuck you it's just thank you yes that's a good idea for a tattoo fuck you cole how do do you have advice on how to be happy yes there's a lot of loneliness and sadness in the world here i can give a very easy piece of advice that worked a lot for me instead of telling yourself that you have these ridiculous standards tell yourself i can be better right i don't have to be a great writer i could be a better writer i don't have to be a great podcaster that will never happen i could be a better podcaster i could be a better person i could be a better at the gym i could be better with my time and when you regard things in the and especially if you have metrics that you can go by you know for i'll i'll run this many miles a day things you have control over if you especially as males when you have this chart and the data is telling you you're improving right away it's like you have this sense of accomplishment so i think that is a really great way to find and if something is not working in your life let's suppose you don't have friends right there's the internet how do people make friends try things out what's the worst that's gonna happen you're gonna does it blow up in your face well you're you're you're learning something at least don't be afraid of making mistakes when i was a kid i was so scared of having things under control so like i would never have to get hit in the face metaphorically and then i realized and you realize this as well everyone who's important gets hit in the face look at the president whoever the president is it becomes a matter of being strong enough that you could take getting hit in the face mhmm so that is a big important switch in your thinking yeah there's a bukowski quote i wrote down sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think i'm not gonna make it but you laugh inside remembering all the times you felt that way yeah yeah there's a part of me that that's like that there's some days where i feel like this is the worst day of my life and then like shortly after i think like chuckle at that yes just knowing the ups and downs of the brain and the mind and life and all that you ever been depressed yeah of course i'm more anxious than depressed i don't really get depressed i like yeah but i've been depressed like low points yeah but i think i i distinguish depression between low points right like if things are going bad and you feel bad that makes sense but i i when i think of depression i think of someone who feels bad when things aren't bad like it's in it's by to me it's like almost by definition irrational well yeah and there's different kinds of i like there there's a exhausted kind of depression where you're not it's not so much sad as you're not don't wanna do anything you you don't want to live you don't want to what's the yeah yeah what's the point what's the point crap yeah and like an extreme self critical negativity which i'm also scared of because my brain is generally very self critical because you're not taking up magnesium do you take a rectally or in the mouth you take a rectally okay but as for as for the magnesium you should take it as a pill okay well the way your mom explained it then is is way different what are you most afraid of holy crap that's that's i i i'm trying to think of anything i'm afraid of you know in nineteen eighty four with the i i thought like even just if i wanted to torture you hypothetically well you're do well mission accomplished you know what i mean i mean in terms of i i'm scared of increasing authoritarianism but that's not personal and that's not that's something that i don't think is as much of an imminent concern as like let's say in canada are you scared to death no didn't come over scared to death no he just accepted it as it's look i i i can i honestly feel like if i died tomorrow i did pretty good with what i had like i i think i did things that matter to me i think i moved the needle on things that matter to me i think i've been a good friend to the people i care about i've saved a couple of lives so i i i can i i think it's a very low bar for someone to be able to go their grave and say you know i left the world a better place than i found it i don't think it's that hard you ever been betrayed oh god yes of course haven't you not as often as i would have predicted yeah the russian upbringing expect like it's like expects everyone to be like just it's a time bomb before they betray you i've been betrayed of course yeah yeah you value loyalty i do and i also made it a point to not let that betrayal color my future directions and regard that as the universal or the norm yeah i think that's very important me too and also i feel bad i i i've gotten lex enough that i feel bad for the person who betrayed me because it's just like they didn't need to do this and at some point if you betray someone you know and you know you're not a good person i believe that yeah like even if you tell yourself there's something i had to do you still know you had to do a bad thing to someone who didn't deserve it and that's a really hard pill to swallow in in my situation i still think good thoughts and empathize with with the people that have done me wrong i don't empathize with them but i sympathize with them my english is not good enough to know the difference empathizing means you're putting yourself in their shoes sympathizing means you feel bad for them and and wish them well yes i wish them well yeah but i don't put my like i it's it's very hard for me to empathize with someone who betrays someone that they care about because that is something it's not that just i think i'm such a great person it's that i feel guilt very strongly so if i did that to someone who trusted me i would really it would fuck up my head for a long time yeah but maybe they were in pain maybe they were desperate maybe they were back just to the to to the wall sure they felt that way sure well that's sympathy thing and a really empathy thing yeah yeah loyalty is a fascinating thing yes i value trust a lot i know you do especially because you're such a public both of us we're you know very public positions you have to be very careful who you surround yourself with it sucks does it well it it it it sucks because it's hard to i usually just trust everybody that's okay that's crazy but what's the alternative to be have a filter well i have a filter in terms of who i interact with okay but within the you know i see the good in people but then you you in the in the very rare instances that might turn okay and yeah it just sucks it breaks my heart yeah i hear you i completely agree has your heart ever been broken yes love yes i'm just so relaxed right now and happy relaxed and happy good this is making me really happy it's so again it's beautiful on like eight different levels i think that's the deepest thing i'm thankful for it's just how beautiful people are and how beautiful the world is i really and people are gonna laugh and i welcome it that's fine i really sometimes feel like the guy in american beauty looking at the plastic bag dancing in the wind mhmm and he's brought to tears because of how much beautiful life is and a lot of people feel the need to sneer at that scene and and ricky's ricky pitts whatever and i think he's got it exactly right i think he does too well in the end you and i will be both laughing that's exact and right and also seeing beauty where others people see garbage and i'd rather be the person who sees beauty than the person who sees garbage yep well when i look at you i see beauty when most people see garbage and it's really unfair mister parrot that you keep saying that but all jokes aside man i'm really grateful for your friendship and i'm really grateful
