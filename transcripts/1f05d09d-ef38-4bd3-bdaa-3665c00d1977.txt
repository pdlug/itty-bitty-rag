and quickly spread over the death of a twenty two year old maxa amini eyewitnesses saw her beaten to death by the morality police this is a heavy topic but it's a really important topic what can you explain what happened the protests are now in their sixth week the death of that young woman occurred who was visiting tehran as a tourist it sparked something very deep that's particularly concerned the younger generations that is what you would call the equivalent of the z generation in this country yes they call themselves the in persian because iran follows the solar calendar of its own it's an ancient solar calendar and this the the the time that they were born they were in the thirteen eighties that's what they call themselves mhmm eighties for the eighties and the well the circumstances that surrounds the unfortunate death of this young beautiful kurdish woman is really tragic she was arrested by the what is referred to as the morality police morality patrol called the yashte ershad guidance police that is presumably there were two women fully clad that is officers serving on that force and two men and nobody exactly knows what had happened she had been beaten up and apparently there was no sign of any wrongdoing on her side she was fully covered it seems that there was some altercation in the process and the the outcome was that she was unconscious not necessarily when she was arrested but in the course of the detention when they take them to a center presumably to reeducate them yeah and she apparently collapsed and maybe my sense is that she must have had some kind of a problem because of the skull being broken or something had happened and she died in the hospital the next day and that's through the social media was widely spread throughout iran and almost the next day surprisingly you could see this outburst of sympathy for her people are in the streets weeping because she was seen as such an innocent young woman twenty two years old and the family the mother and the father also mourning for her and being a kurd visiting tehran this all added up to really turn her into some kind of a martyr of this cause and that's what it is and her picture graphics that were artistically produced based on her portrait has now dominates basically as the symbol of this protest movement and the protest movement goes on everybody was thinking or at least the authorities were thinking that it's going to die out in a matter of a few days but it became more intense first in the streets of tehran by young women mostly probably between i would say seventeen eighteen teenagers to twenty two twenty three or thereabouts and then to university campuses all around the country and then even to high schools and that also made it a very remarkable protest movement because first of all it involves the youth and not necessarily the older generations you see them around but not as many also you see men and women together young girls and boys and they are adamant they are desperate in a sense of the tone of their protest and they are extremely courageous because they stand against the security forces that were immediately were sent off to the streets so and in full gear that is so what are the the currents of pain emotion what is this turmoil that rose to the surface that resulted in these big protests what are the different feelings ideas that came to the surface here that resulted in such quick scaling of this protest well if you listen to the main slogan which is the message of this movement it's called women life freedom zan zendigi azerdi which is a translation of actually the kurdish equivalent which is close to persian being in the european language and it's apparently initiated first in the syrian kurdistan where they were fighting against the the islamic forces because they were attacking the yazidis there and the women being enslaved but the message as it moved or historians are interested in this kind of trends so it has moved to kurdistan and from kurdistan now being the message of this movement reflects pretty much sums up what this movement is all about women in the forefront because of all the one might say discriminations the treatment the humiliation that this younger generation feels well not only the younger generations but most of the iranian secular middle classes since nineteen seventy nine basically for the for the past forty three years and they would think that the these all basically symbolized or represented by the varying the mandatory varying of the hijab mhmm which is at the core of this protest you see the young women and if you look at many of these clips that comes through in the past six weeks women in streets take off their mandatory scarves which is a young shawl or some kind of a head covering that's all and they throw it into the bonfire in the middle of the street and they dance around it mhmm and slogans so there is a sense of complete rejection of what this regime for forty two years forty three years have been imposing on women it's not as it sometimes been portrayed a movement against hijab through and through but it's basically says you know there has to be a choice for those who want to wear hijab and those who want to remain without hijab yeah the hijab is a symbol of something much deeper much deeper and actually before we get into that it's interesting to note that in many of these demonstrations you see in the university campuses or in the streets you see women with hijab young women with hijab are next to those have to remove their hijab and they are together basically protesting that's the most interesting feature of this of these demonstrations and then men and women together against the segregation that the regime has imposed upon them in for all these years now in terms of what it represents as i pointed out one is the question of the whole series of one might say civil and legal discriminations against women you are considered as a kind of a second class citizen you depend on your men it's a kind of a patriarchy mhmm that has been institutionalized in the islamic republic in a very profound fashion and that means that probably in matters of divorce marriage and divorce in matters of custody of your children in matter of inheritance in matter of freedom of movement you depend on your husband your father your brother a male member of your family your child even your your son could could be the case and because of that obviously a younger generation who is so well informed through social media knows about the world as much as an american does american kid does and probably sometimes more they're very very curious it's from what i hear or sometimes that i met a few of them outside iran you'll see that how the this new generation is completely different from what the islamic republic wanted to create in its social engineering it's basically the failure of forty three years of the islamic republic's act of imposition of a certain so called islamic values on on women then it's a matter of education you would see that there is segregation in the schools one of the issues that now right now is at the heart of this demonstration is is that self-service is in many of the campuses of iranian universities are segregated male and female two different rooms two different halls now they're breaking through the walls virtually everywhere and sit together in order to basically resist the authorities who wants to impose segregation in matters of appearance in the public of course it it it may seem to us as kind of trivial and secondary but appearance is important clothing is important how you would imagine yourself is important they don't want to be seen in the way that the authorities would like to impose upon them as this kind of an idea of a chaste islamic woman who is fully covered and is fully protected the idea of a male member of the family protects the female that is what you would see at the heart of this rebellion and of course that goes with everything else the second part of this message the idea of life basically means if you like to use the american equivalent of this the pursuit of the happiness that's what they want they want fun mhmm they want music they want dancing they want to be free in the street they want to have girlfriends and live freely and don't be constantly looked by the big brother to tell them what to do mhmm and not to do or or not to do so that is you that they share with virtually with the entire with the entire iranian society as a whole although the older generations that's a big puzzle but you would see that the older generation don't so far at least don't take part as extensively as one might might imagine and this is variety of reasons perhaps you can get to that later on if you like but as far as this younger generation they don't care they don't listen even as much to their parents as the older generations did so all the or one might say even the nature of the relationship between the parents and the youth has changed it's not the concept of again a a patriarchy mhmm that a father or even a mother would tell the daughter or son what to do mhmm because basically they have to negotiate it's fundamentally a rejection of the power of authority parents government yes it's that every person can decide their own fate yes and there's no lessening of value of the wisdom of old age and old institutions precisely that's what it is yeah and they are surprisingly aware that where they are as a generation so so it's a sense of pride as we are different from the older generation yeah from your parents who compromised and lived with the restrictions that the islamic regime put on you your grandfa your their grandparents was the generation that actually involved in the revolution of seventy nine the parents which were the middle generation and these are the third generation after the revolution of nineteen seventy nine and they therefore they differentiate themselves in terms of their identity from the older generation so that's the life part of it i one can go more and more they want to access and they see on social media what happens in the rest of the world they're well aware they're much better digitally skilled than my generation for instance and and they know about all the personalities they know about all the celebrities they know about all the trends that goes out outside iran so that that's a second part of this message and then of course the third part is the word azadi meaning freedom or liberty which is this long standing demand of the iranians i would say for the whole century ever since the constitutional revolution of nineteen o six mhmm iran has witnessed this problem of authorities that usually emerge at the end of a revolution to basically impose its own image on the population on the youth and creates authoritarian regimes of which over the course of time i would say that the islamic republic is the worst the sense that it's it's intrusion and it's not only in the political sense for instance banning the freedom of speech you know meddling with the elections banning political parties all kinds of bad things which are the political or civil freedoms but it's intrusion into the personal life of the individual which is the worst kind in a sense as you would see that there is always an authority that basically dominates your life or monitors your life so i i and they they do it in a kind of a very consistent fashion which makes this idea of freedom so important as part of the message of this new movement you would see that in today's iran there are no independent political parties there's very little probably freedom of the press i wouldn't say that it's entirely gone but it's fairly limited there's enormous amount of propaganda machine which dominates the entire radio and tv system in iran it's completely in the hands of the government and of course you would see this variety of other tools for trying to indoctrinate iranian population across the board so that's another sign of this kind of a sense of sense of being totally left out you're not belonging to to what's going on in terms of pow power empowerment and disempowerment so that's that's the situation as far as the idea of a freedom is concerned and this three somewhat miraculously and perhaps unintentionally the three parts of this message complements each other because perhaps for the first time we see that women are in the forefront of a of a movement i hesitate to say revolution because i'm not particularly happy with revolutions revolutions worldwide and in iran have always been so miserable in terms of their outcome that we have to be careful not to use the word yes revolution yeah so that's where where it stands now and the regime was thinking that well these are kids they're going to go away and then of course they're completely conspiratorial in their thinking mhmm they constantly think that these are all the instigations and provocations of foreign powers these are the great satan united states this is israel or these are the it's actually the supreme leader states in so many words his only response so far that he had in past past six weeks with regard to these demonstrations is that these are the children of the sabak sabak being the security forces of the shah's time that's forty three years later he claims that the children seven sixteen seventeen years twenty years old kids in the street are the grandchildren or children of some imaginary survival of the shah's security forces so there's the idea is that these protests are internal and external saboteurs so people trying to sabotage the government yes and and they are misled mislad as far as they can go and then there's the great satan united states and other places are controlling sort of either controlling the narrative feeding propaganda or literally sending people to i don't think that they have i don't think even they have that kind of imagination precisely say what you have said yeah that they would say that they're controlling the narrative they basically say no these are agents yeah of of the foreign powers and their families are all sold out and they are basically lost their loyalties to the great islamic republic and therefore they can be treated so brutally they can be suppressed so brutally which i haven't actually said what they are doing because i thought perhaps first we should talk about who these kids are in the streets before we move on in the about the response of the government but one major factor which seems to add to the anxiety of well the regime is extremely anxious now because they're in a position this shows that they don't have the lack of confidence in a sense that they would see them reacting in a very forceful way because basically they don't seem to have that kind of a confidence to allow this this message or the movement to air to be air but the one element which corresponds to that is that there is a expatriate population of iranians worldwide they are probably now according to some estimates close to four million even more iranians abroad and they're all over the world from australia new zealand japan western europe turkey and united states and canada mhmm so just to give you one example last last saturday there was a mass demonstrations in berlin mhmm by the iranians from germany and all all over europe western europe and it was at least i think probably the conservative estimate was about hundred thousand so hundred thousand iranians showed up in berlin demonstrating against the treatment of the women in iran or the movement in iran the government thinks obviously this must have been some instigation by foreign powers and they want to destroy the islamic republic and not only that but their propaganda is kind of ridiculous because i listened actually to how they portrayed it in the newspapers i listened to the iranian news that is officially controlled government controlled news and and in the papers there's much of the papers that are in the control of the government one of them or actually the the major news program portrayed the demonstrations that ten thousand people showed up in berlin and protested against the rising prices or rising rates for gas and oil mhmm in germany yeah so that's how they mislead in a very rather stupid fashion because probably ninety five percent if not hundred percent of the iranians are listening to persian speaking media outside iran so it's a bbc persian there is iran international there are at least five or six of them that's probably really important to highlight that iran is a very modern and tech savvy nation not just the young people probably more than more than i feel sometimes when i compare myself to what they are doing yeah since nineteen seventy nine the earlier years for a decade or two they tried in a very crude fashion to restrict access to media outside iran mhmm because this is all through dishes okay and satellite dishes are everywhere you know if you look at the you know buildings of you know it's small house small towns and villages in iran it's it's there's always a dish and they watch all kinds of things through this and particularly because of what's happening now they listen to all the news broadcast from all this media and they're extremely active mhmm there are probably some of them even twenty four hours or close very extensive coverage of every clip that comes through so what the government is doing now the islamic republic is that they restrict the entire internet they shut down the internet they shut down the internet but they cannot afford shutting the internet because much of the business much of the everyday life much of the government affairs depends on the internet like everywhere else mhmm and iran is extremely if you if i hear from many of the colleagues and friends you know it's like in certain respects it's like sweden mhmm where you go there there's no more currency and for very good reason because there's so much inflation that the that the bank notes are worthless in a sense so everything is true you know sweeping your card mhmm and and that's entire system is in a standstill because people cannot buy food they can you you go to the supermarket that's how you would do it you you order food to come to your house which iranians do at least the middle classes the more prosperous middle classes doing all the time mhmm so they deliver everything and because of the covid it became even more and they have to pay all through this system so what happens is that now they're estimating that every day fifty million dollars the iranian government or the iranian economy is losing because of slowing the internet plus the frustration is growing of course because you can't order food a man got his feet right i mean they are they are in touch with yeah with whatsapp yeah every iranian virtually every iranian yeah that has education and education in the sense that has gone through the the high schools and universities knows how to use the whatsapp so there's a big middle class like you said secular middle class in iran yes and there there's a lot of at least capacity for if not revolution then political ideological turmoil and a huge amount of hatred so the hatred is grown yes hatred of the of the policies of the regime of isolation that's a huge point that you hear a great deal about we don't want to be isolated we don't want to be humiliated iran is not about this this miserable regime that is ruling over us we have a great culture so there's a sense of a pride in their own culture some of it's you know islamic some of it pre islamic so they there's a huge sense of a pride in that and they see that they cannot communicate with the outside world they they want to travel abroad which they do i mean for one thing the iranian regime never actually for majority of the population never puts restrictions it's not like where is it soviet union where you have to have a used to have a permission to move from one place to another and then of course the the islamic regime since nineteen seventy nine basically chased away or destroyed the old middle class that's my generation basically my parents' generation these are the secular middle class of the pahlavi era in the hope that they can do this social engineering and create this islamic society of their own the bad news for them was that that didn't happen and that memory persisted and the middle class that was created since past forty years is much larger in size than what it was because there was of course the demographic revolution that's it's a very that's a very foundation of it it's the demographic revolution population in iran i've written an article about it actually population in iran since the turn of the century last century this twentieth century population of iran was about nine million or so it's now eighty three million and that is since nineteen seventy nine the population was thirty five million between the past forty years it's basically doubled so it's eighty three million although one of the great successes i don't want to bore you with the details about the demography but it's important in it demographics is not important you well you you can see that the birth rate was very high otherwise you wouldn't have doubled your population in matter of four decades yeah but iranians because of the urban shift to an urban population because of the growth of the middle class because of the education they basically the pattern of the of of growth population growth changed iran used to be two point eight or three percent birth rate mhmm in around nineteen eighties i would say nineteen seventies nineteen eighties now it is one point one mhmm and it's what probably the most successful country in the middle east in terms of the population control despite the government a consistent attempt to try to encourage people to have more kids middle class refuses to do that and this is middle class not only anymore in the capital but this is very smaller towns and cities places that used to be villages now you look at them they have a decent population fifty thousand hundred thousand and they live an urban life and they don't want to be subjected to that old pattern of a agrarian society when you had ten children or eight children and of course it's much more advanced in terms of in terms of health and medicine so you don't lose lose children as they used to the antibiotics there's always of kids to survive and therefore if you have ten kids you're sick with ten kids mhmm you don't end up with four as it used to be in the past six of them would have died in the in the after the age of five actually but now because of that you see that this urban population in the cities have completely different demands and of course the education is important that's another area of how the social engineering of the islamic republic went array because they were thinking that you know the growth of the population the growth of the educated higher educated middle classes in their benefit or they could not even control it in a sense now iran in my time probably had in the nineteen seventies probably by the time of the revolution had ten twelve universities now it has fifty six universities all across the country and there is an something referred to as the free university azad which has campuses all over the country it has three hundred and twenty four campuses all around iran what does that mean in many respects these youth that are brought up in these families mhmm even in small towns in very traditional families in families that belong to that kind of a more religious loyal to the clergy or to the clerical classes their children can now move on which particularly women mhmm because in in my times it would have been unheard of that you would have a young woman of eighteen or seventeen eighteen nineteen from a traditional city such as for instance yazd or in in in southeast and iran to move on elsewhere for education as you do in this country okay now it's completely accepted that a woman wears her hijab because she's forced to wear her hijab to go to a university completely on the other side of the country and this movement of the population not only because of the universities but in general if you now visit iran you hear accents local accents provincial accents all over the country that is a azerbaijani turkish accent from the north west of the country you can hear it in the farce province in the south and vice versa so and kurdish for instance or even more marginal regions such as sistan province in the southeast of iran which has been the subject of this recent massacre when they actually attacked the population when demonstrating and killed a fair number of at least sixty people so this movement of the population this creation of a larger middle class the better educated middle class much better educated iran has eighty six percent literacy which i think probably i haven't checked that but probably is better than turkey even it's probably better than anywhere else in the middle east and it sounds like there's a that's quickly increasing so because because of the movement because of the growth of the education system that's done nicely iran has one million school teachers which may not seem as much if you are in the united states but it's a fairly big number actually can you linger on the massacre what happened there well the sistan province is a baloch ethnicity of baloch ethnicity baloch is a particular ethnic group in southern iran which is sunni rather than shia majority and we should say that most of iran is she is she and those are that's a branch of islam she is then yes let's maybe just briefly linger shi'ism and and sunni what where just just let's not get into it yeah i don't want to let's do a one sentence summary and that maybe which which is what most of iran is majority of the population of the muslim world are sunnis that are these are main street if you like to call that actually sunnah means that kind of a main street can you actually linger on the the sunni sunnah shi'a shia shi'a means party means those that belongs to a party of ali which was goes back to the early islamic history of seventh century i i mean i'm almost lingering to the silly notion of pronunciation and stuff like that so yeah i mean i means part like what what is the extra i at the end do she e means belonging to the she community yeah she a means a person of a shia that belongs to that community are you a shia yes i'm a shia yeah and shia is the community community and in english when it was anglicized it becomes shiite so if you say shiite in today yeah it's perfectly acceptable and of course i myself in my writings i always switch between one and the other one of my books is always shiite the other book's always she and that's hasn't been settled this but the xi population is the smaller compared to the sunni population in the world in the world in the world but in iran it's the opposite the iran and iraq and possibly now lebanon are the three countries who barely iraq and lebanon have barely majority shi population whereas iran is a large shi population due to its history of conversion to shi'ism that by itself is another story but in the sense that the the way that historically it evolved the center became mushy and the peripheries remained sunni so you have communities of the baloch in the southeast you have the kurds a large portion of the kurds are sunnis they have shis as well then they have the indigenous religion of their own ideal what's called al haq which is the religion of indigenous to kurdistan there are turkiamans in the northeast of iran who are also sudanese there are other communities in khorasan region in the in the peripheries of afghanistan there are also sudanese and you have some arab population arab speaking population in the khuzestan province in the southwest of iran which is also or across the persian gulf is there a lot of conflict between these regions and also like if i blindfolded you and dropped you off in one of the regions would you quickly recognize the region like by the food by the music by the yes accents by so on yeah the answer to your lovely question which i think i hope it would have happened to me is that yes you would see different cultures yes there are but different food most important different accents yeah or different languages since they have dialects there's baluch is a different language altogether but or so for that matter kurdish which is closer to persian because they are indo european languages but turkish azeri turkish which is probably closer to the turkish of turkey republic of turkey or to the republic of azerbaijan in the north they're they're the same basically actually if you would have looked that's a fascinating picture if you have looked at the let's say even nineteenth century or early twentieth century linguistic map of iran would have been amazed in the number of dialects in the number of languages that has survived and this is an ancient country it's an ancient land and it's a lot of mountains all around it mhmm or big deserts so there's a sense of isolation so you would say here and there you see a different community that speaks differently all ancient traditions and languages yeah and because of the great number of invasions that iran witnessed over more than two and a half millennia of course there are all kinds of cultures that were introduced into iran they're all ethnicities were introduced to iran mostly coming from the northeast of iran from from the lowlands of central asia and beyond and and continued into iran proper so but now what has happened that's what my point that i wanted to make century of modernity or modernization has produced a national culture of great length great strength in a sense i would say i ended my book the the book on iran iran and modern history basically saying that despite everything else that has created so much trouble for today's iran there is a sense of a cultural identity that is very strong and i think i can say with with some confidence that despite this despite this regional identities that are still there and they're great and they should be celebrated this today if you go to to kurdistan or if you go to sistan they all can speak persian they all have an education in persian so they all basically are becoming part of whether they like it whether they like their regime in power or not they have a sense of belonging to a culture and an identity with the center and of course the idea of a center for versus periphery in iran is very old it goes back to ancient times because even the name of the country was the guarded domains of iran this is the this is the official name of namely that it was recognized that this is not just one entity but is it's a collection of entities like the united states of america exactly exactly but the united states of america in a sense you can say that it was a very successful well it remains to be seen how successful to be continued to be to that that was basically invented yeah created that you would have this sense of it in in the case of an old nature which has been on the map of the world for three thousand years two thousand five hundred years there's this is not an exaggeration i am not a nationalist per se but i mean if you look persia on the map of the world in ancient times it is still there as it is today very few countries in the world are like that mhmm that they would have that kind of a continuity over a course of time and that's not without a reason because there was this sense of a center versus periphery that had found some is it there's a huge amount of tension but there is also a sense of belonging to something and state is very much at the center of it i mean that's why the concept of a state matters for the creation for the shaping of of this culture what happened is therefore you can see that today in answer to your point about traveling blindfolded is that you would be surprised to see how much people share and in terms of i just give you one anecdote in nineteen sixty eight i believe must have been i traveled to azerbaijan i i used to travel and actually photograph not blindfolded mostly well yeah not blindfolded no no not blindfolded yeah so i went to a bazaar in the city of khoi which is in the northwestern iran on the border with what is today the republic of turkey and i went to the bazaar and i was interested in the kind of a leather work that they produce so i tried to buy some stuff and they were surprised to see that how few people knew persia mhmm so they could not communicate in persian with you either they have to ask somebody from some other store to come and translate for you this is nineteen sixty eight nineteen six so even though it's the official language was persian yes the country they're still yeah so what do they teach in school so it doesn't matter to special but this guy he doesn't go to school he hasn't been to this school or he was not fully exposed to it and or the guy usually are very conservative places right so it stuck in my mind now in recently in two thousand four i was traveling to the same area not to the same city but to the same area and i was amazed to see how the youth as soon as they would know that you're coming from somewhere else opening conversation with you talking about the latest movies mhmm that was produced in the west and it's not only hollywood of course there's a huge amount of fascination with hollywood and western cinema cinema is a major thing filmmaking is a major thing yeah so these kids in the city of ajar were asking me we're having lunch they're asking me okay then what do you think about this producer not producer this director or that actor american american european as well but mostly american were they speaking persian or it's a complete persian that i would converse with them do they speak english too interesting yes actually you would be surprised to see what percentage of the iranian youth at least in big cities are fascinated with learning language and for a reason because they think that's the way to get access either on social media or eventually leave iran yeah unfortunately and and because they don't see a future for themselves in the country either you have to be part of this part of this regime or if you hate them and you don't like the way of their life you look up outside you know i was having drivers to drive me around the country in the cities around tehran and the guy was young extremely well educated well dressed and we would have looked at him we could have found him in any street in any country in the western world and his major concern knowing that i'm from outside major concern is well tell me which would be a better place for me to go to work what's wrong with the place that you're in right now you are in your own country you speak your own language no this is no good i have to have a better future this is no future for me well it's it's really interesting because the thing i feel about the protests right now is there's a large number of people that instead of giving into cynicism mhmm about you know this government is no good yeah they're actually getting this like energy this desire to for revolution in in the sort of nonviolent sort of in the in the democratic sense of that let's let's actually find the ideas let's let's build a great nation here this is a great nation this is my nation let's build something great here well that's my hope that's well i said that yeah yeah that's what i'm hoping for i share your aspiration but i'm fearing that i hope it's not a wishful thinking certainly that's what they want certainly that's what they want to create but the historian always tells you from where they start to where they finish there is going to be a huge kind of a change and in this particular case i wouldn't be i i would very much hope that it's not going to be a revolution like nineteen seventy nine islamic revolution and i have my hopes in that for one thing this is a revolution that doesn't have a leader okay and it seems that you're comfortable with that at least so far because we are we're the sixth week of this movement and they hope it's not going to be actually a revolution as i pointed out before mhmm i hope it's going to be more of a sense of trying to come to some compromise and gradually move toward change rather than a collapse of this regime and replacement with what so the anxiety of the regime you hope will turn into a kind of realization that you have to you have to modernize you have to make progress you actually have to make certain compromises yes or constitutional changes all those kind of stuff so the basic yes process of government and lawmaking the problem is that they say we have it all you know we have our parliament we have our constitution we have our elections which has all been of course fake but they claim they have all of that but the problem for them is that they try to superimpose a certain ideology like all other ideological autocracies or autarkies as in this case that tend to dominate all these institution buildings that they have they they constantly claim we have this we have that and it's a of course it's a generational thing the upper echelons of this regime are mostly older people turbaned they are the clergy that are afraid of the fact that they may lose their control over their whole system that they this is sophisticated huge system of government and they rely on certain tools of control which is the revolutionary guards and other other institutions that are loyal to to the state mhmm and they spend enormous amount of funds that is available to them at least before the sanctions but even during the sanctions they still have enough funds to do so and in order to remain in power mhmm and they are extremely ruthless in that regard this is not a nice islamic fatherly regime this is a regime that i would see easily in it clear signs of fascism clear signs of the state control and pay any price to stay in power so even violence extreme violence to return to the massacre what what were the uses of violence to suppress protests well yes it was actually quite remarkable to see that from the first or the second day of the protest you see out in the streets this riot police okay which comes out in large numbers mhmm fully geared up their appearance are rather terrifying like any other riot police probably more than any other riot police they're violent and they stand in the streets when the students are demonstrating given in smaller number because before i go to that i should point this point this out to you as well that's that these demonstrations are not large ones in one place you see you don't see hundred thousand people in in one place but you see in every neighborhood couple of thousand of kids are demonstrating all over iran all over iran now all over the world in different parts yes yes actually during the demonstrations three weeks ago they've as i said they had people in sydney australia new zealand tokyo all over the world all protesting high gas prices it's funny everywhere everywhere to the extent that they could be ignored yeah nothing but if they could not be ignored yeah and it's actually quite remarkable that this is very embarrassing to them yeah but somehow they think that this propaganda machine of them is working oh so you think they don't have a good even sense i mean it's so there's an incompetence within the propaganda machine yes it is there's an incompetence across the board yeah i mean despite all of this massive government administration or whatever you would call it all these various components of it there is a sense of there is a sense of inefficiency and incompetence that is associated within every action that you see even in their suppression of this street movement mhmm but in in answer to that question you would see that there this riot police very it's quite obvious that they were trained for the purpose so this their appearance everything these are not just regular army forces or soldiers conscripts they are professional forces and they come not only in on foot number but they come on motorbikes so there are you would see in any of these demonstrations there are ten twelve fifteen twenty motorbikes with two passengers one in front riding the one in the back fully equipped with the baton with paint guns with pellet guns and with bullets so they are very fully equipped and they're terrifying they go through the demonstrations that hit and beat people mhmm and then the arrests and then you see behind the first line of these riot police you would see all these latest models of these special armored trucks for moving to the demonstrations and arresting people throwing them into this and then behind that water water cannons you see and i was looking at that i was like okay this is tehran probably they have this but then you look at the smallest cities they still have the same thing so all over the country one thing that they had managed to produce extensively irrespective of the fact that whether they are effective or not but you see them everywhere so it just shows that how afraid this regime is but that also shows that there's an infrastructure that can implement violence at scale yes very much so and it's probably part and parcel of this regime from day one the number of prisons that they have according to perhaps an exaggerated version they said that about twelve thousand or so arrested that are in in jails today since past six weeks they were two hundred and thirty or forty people were killed including children i under eighteen they are they beat up women in the street which is extremely actually disturbing when you see these scenes of so there's a lot of this is on video too right everything is on video everybody has a camera and everybody sends to major news outlets outside iran mhmm and they immediately showed every night if you look at bbc persian or iran international or a few are for the i think there's six of them actually all over there in england they are in deutsche welle in germany which has a particular interest in the iranian bbc world service and so forth in london and voice of america personally here in this country there is another one radio fado which is also funded by the american government also fully covers all of these events so there is no way that these people can that the iraq can miss what's going on in the streets of these demonstrations and the scenes of beating up women which in iranian culture as i presume in most cultures in the world there is a certain sanctity that you don't attack women but they do and this is an islamic regime that supposedly have to have a certain sense of concern and and protection protection like a like a deep respect for women grounded in a a tradition of protecting them but instead this kind of idea that was instilled in law has turned into a deep disrespect of women exactly or fear that these women are not any longer the girls that we thought we are bringing up in this society the source of you losing your power will be these these women that's the fear yeah and you see of course this government do have a support base i mean it would be totally wrong to think that the islamic republic has not created its own power base it does but it's probably if there's no way there are no statistics that we can or i'm not aware of any statistics that i can give you in numbers what's the percentage of support for the regime in iran but quite frankly i don't think it's more than probably ten percent of the population i i generous i i would be surprised if it's that low i i would say so if my understanding because i've been very deeply paying attention to the war in ukraine in to ukraine to russia and to support in russia for putin yes i think without knowing the details without even considering the effects of propaganda and stuff like that is there's probably a large number of people in iran that don't see this as a battle of human rights but see it as a battle of conservatism like tradition versus modernization and they value tradition that that what they fear from the throwing away of the hijab is not the loss of power and like the women getting human rights what they fear is is the same stuff you fear when you're sitting on a porch and saying kids these days have no respect basically that the there's a large number of iranians that probably value tradition and the beauty of the culture and like there they fear that kids with their internet and their videos and their revolution will throw away everything that made this country hold together for millennia right yes i know i would agree with you in the sense that probably like everywhere else in the world this is the generational thing you know every generation thinks differently about the younger generation no doubt and in iran it's the same but the there is another factor here is involved those that we would consider them as traditional no longer seem to have their loyalties to this regime that's powerful meaning that they this they they consider as a brutal regime that is prepared to kill children in the streets yeah and does a lot of things wrong of course it tries to take care of the its own power base it there's a very strong sense of if you start here there's a very strong sense in this regime that there are people that is theirs and there others which are not theirs there's a word for it even in person they call it one of us okay oh so it's a well it's very that's very fascistic it's like yes yes it's or for that matter i i suppose soviet union would have if you were a member of the party mhmm and like you know your children would have received a special kind of treatment yourself as well this sense of us versus them for a while worked because the younger people coming from the countryside to the cities certain fact certain sector of them would have fund would have fund protection and support from the government they they they wanted to belong to something and the mosques and the mornings morning associations in the neighborhoods and so forth would have given them there's actually a term for it it's called those those have been recruited mhmm by the state and this is the youth kind of vigilante if you like that that you can see them also in these demonstrations sometimes thugs they're called the civil cloth so the people that that comes to these demonstrations that start beating up these young people and they they are not in in security police uniforms but they they are just regular clothes and these people yes they still support and they still benefit because they get jobs they get privileges and these are very important for a for a for a state that basically monopolizes most of the resources mhmm you see even beef even during the sanction let alone before the sanction the oil revenue of iran which is the major source of the state government was the monopoly of the state mhmm it was monopoly of the state during the pahlavi era from the start basically so what does that mean that mean that the regime in power is not no longer is particularly accountable to the majority population because it extracts wealth from underground and it uses it for its own purposes in order to make it more powerful in order to make it more repressive than what it is the regime today so it feeds a small or i wouldn't say but a fair number of its own supporters i mean the revolutionary guards in iran is probably about three hundred and fifty thousand or something like that it's a very big force and this is not the regular army the revolutionary guards are independent from the from the revolutionary guard is armed forces controlled by the state yes the same as the army but these are more ideologically tied up with the state and they're also in facing internal facing what's their purpose what's their stated what's the stated purpose of the revolution well from day one when the revolution succeeded the regime in power the islamic regime in power was vulnerable to all kinds of forces of opposition mhmm within iran itself for the revolution yeah that's the the revolutionary guards and the job was to try to make sure that the regime stays in power and of course over the force of over the course of forty years they became more powerful more organized better funded better trained well at least we think they're better trained but we don't know because the level of incompetence perhaps it can be seen through the rank and file as well right but you know they developed their own in this military industry i mean those drones that you see now putin's regime are throwing on ukrainians poor ukrainians those are all built by the revolutionary guards by the military industry under the control of the revolutionary guards and like similar regimes in the middle east at least these are military industrial complexes you can find them in egypt of course which is very powerful very traditionally has been empowered and still is in power you find them in pakistan which is it is extremely powerful and they can change the prime ministers as they did in the case of the last one you can find them probably in myanmar it's the same phenomenon and i can if you look around you can find quite a number of them and the revolutionary guards is equivalent of that this this is a powerful establishment force which militarily is powerful industrially is powerful and since the start of the revolution they have been given projects so we want to build dams which they did a major disaster environmental disaster they built hundred and something dams all across the country this is the revolutionary regard who does it so they have all kinds of tentacles all around the country controlling various states and because it's their job and they have power they have prestige there's a huge incentive to join them and to join them and to stay so like they you know when they're having dinner at home with their families there's not an incentive to to join the protests sort of well that is the point i think i'm the evolutionary guys may be an extreme but many of the people who depend on the state mhmm for their support now the younger generation are telling their parents you are wrong you don't provide for us this society this state does not provide what we want mhmm so there is a descent within the family it seems to me i hope it's not a wishful thinking you know there is a kind of a joke going around you see this terrible guys the beaded and then traditional clerical appearance when you see them talking about women they are very of course politically incorrect they are very looking down towards women as as i said you know they have to be inside they have to be protected they have not to be seen and so forth but if they have a young person a young daughter in their family mhmm you see that their discourse changes they no longer seem to be referring to women as second class citizen yeah so that's very important that's precisely that point mhmm that when you have this younger generation no matter how privileged they are and many of them are privileged you know and there is also the regime has created its own privileged class that are not necessarily directly paid by the regime but they benefit from contractors certain professions that that benefit from what the state provides for them and iran is a i mean the past forty years you can see iran has developed in terms of material culture remarkably iran has good communication has roads all over the place it's not like a it's it's more like i don't know whether you have ever visited turkey for instance mhmm in certain respects even more advanced than turkey but it's closer to that rather than if you travel i don't want to bring particular names in north africa or parts of the middle east or other parts of the islamic world it's much much different so in this respect you would see certain contrast or paradoxes here on the certain respect there's the growth and there is urbanization there is modern economy on the other hand you see this superimposed ideological doctrinal aspect that has driven the regime over all these years and they cannot get rid of it they cannot in this respect they cannot modernize themselves they think that they are already perfect in ideological sense this is the best solution for the world not for only for iran but for the muslim world and for the world as a whole we are anti imperialist we have managed to survive either under sanctions this is all part of the rhetoric mhmm but of course at the huge expense the huge expense for their own population and the point that you have raised is the fact that we now witness there is a not only a generation gap between the youth and their parents but there is a a break in a sense from the older generations and they are very distinctly the youth that has a different view of the world and does not want to compromise whether they would be able to succeed or not remains to be seen whether this regime is going to suppress it maybe but it actually brought to surface many of aspects of the weaknesses of this regime in power well i hear from a lot of people that are in these protests now and so my love goes to them and stay strong because it's inspiring to see people fighting for those things the women life and freedom especially freedom yes because that can only lead to a good thing in the long term at least and if possible to avoid a violent revolution of course that is something that we all want to see before we return to the present let's jump around let's go to the past we mentioned nineteen seventy nine what happened in nineteen seventy nine in iran well in nineteen seventy nine there was a revolution that eventually came to be known as the islamic revolution and even up to this day many of the observers or those who have strong views that would not like to refer to it as islamic revolution or even a revolution so the because the nature of it in the earlier stages of it started really probably around nineteen seventy seven it took two years was much more all embracing it was not islamic in a particular fashion or at all in a sense it started with a kind of a very liberal democrat agenda which required which demanded mostly by people who were the veterans of the older generations of iranian liberal nationalists that were left out in the pahlavi period it's a period of the shah became increasingly authoritarian increasingly suppressive and therefore basically leaving no space or no political space open for any kind of a give and take any kind of a conversation or participation that was in the seventies seventies seventies particularly in the seventies can we actually even like just do a a whirlwind review from nineteen o six to nineteen seventy nine okay sure in nineteen o six there was a period act actually as you might know the first decade or did so of of the twentieth century witnessed numerous what we refer to as constitutional revolutions including russia in nineteen o five the first revolution including the chinese revolution in nineteen constitutional revolution in nineteen ten the young turks revolution in nineteen o eight and the iranian revolution in nineteen o six do i understand why the synchronicity of all of it why in so many different places very different cultures very different government very different cultures but all of them in a sense were coming out of the regimes that became progressively powerful yeah without having any kind of a legal system that would protect the individual vis a vis the state so the idea of law and the constitution according to which there should be a certain protection a certain civil society became very common yeah but i wonder where that because that's been that way for for a very very long time and so i wonder you know it's it's funny certain ideas just their time comes exactly it's like eighteen forty eight when you would see that there's a whole range of revolutions across europe yeah or you would see for instance the arab spring you see all these revolutions in the arab world which unfortunately nearly all of them failed so yes these are very contagious ideas that moves across frontiers from one culture to another and i presume we can add to that there are two elements with which one can say there is was a greater communication there is a greater sense of a world economy mhmm and the turn of the century witnessed the first decade of the century witnessed a period of volatility particularly in in currency so many of the countries of the world particularly non west mhmm suffered in and particularly the businesses suffered and not surprisingly the business class were in the forefront of many of these constitutional movements requiring the state to give the kind of a created the right kind of institutions to listen to their voices to their concerns and the creation of a democratic system parliamentary and system with which there would be representation popular representation proper elections and so forth and constitutions and this very much is a kind of a french idea of the constitution going back all the way perhaps to seventeen eighty nine revolution montesquieu all this kind of philosophy were greatly appreciated particularly the freight system so what were the ideas in the nineteen o six iranian constitution they precisely the same they were demanding a creation of a legal system with division of power between the three executive legislative and the judiciary mhmm not unlike the american system and they requested basically a certain public space to be created between the two sources of power mhmm the state which had this kind of a control over the if you like the secular aspect of life in the society and the religious establishment that had the full control over the religious aspects and both of them from the perspective of the constitution is considered as repressive and therefore there has to be a new space open between these two and that was the idea of a constitutional revolution but by its very nature it was an idea of modernity they wanted the modern society they wanted a better material life they they wanted a more representation and and so forth the constitutional revolution as i always would say is much more of a innocent revolution it's a revolution that did not particularly have much violence in it mhmm contrary to many other revolutions it did not have a centralized leadership per se that's why actually i'm getting i mean beside the practices i'm getting a lot of requests for interviews to compare what's happening now with the revolution of nineteen o six nineteen nineteen o nine are there any echoes yes yes there are there are because that was a movement that started without a without a centralized leadership mhmm but actually various voices that emerged in various among the merchants or the businessmen in the economic community among the representatives who came to the first parliament the press the new generation of the privileged aristocracy who were educated and believed in the constitutional values all of these voices emerged the same time and somehow they managed to to coexist in the first and the second parliaments that were created between nineteen o six and nineteen ten or nineteen eleven mhmm but they all faced huge problems in the sense that iran was in a dire economic situation this is before the days of the discovery of oil which actually coincides with the discovery there are two important coin coincidences one is that the oil was discovered in the south in nineteen o nine during the course of the constitutional revolution mhmm second is that in nineteen o seven the two great powers of the time the russian empire and the british empire who always honored iran as being a buffer state between them because they didn't want to get too close to one another basically came to an agreement facing the fear of the rise of the german empire mhmm so this is the period of entente as you might know in european history whereby the the french the british and the russians all create alliance that ultimately leads to the first world war against germany and at the same time the discovery of oil that the oil industry being a a very powerful defining factor of the twentieth century for iran exactly source of a lot of money lots of money but not all of it in the hands of the iranians only one fifth of it by way of royalties came to iran there is much of it went to the anglo persian oil company which they actually discovered the oil in the province khosestan province is the southwest of iran where is the major oil industries today right now and this business is an extremely profitable enterprise for that company and for the british government it's actually purchased by the british government churchill purchased anglo iranian oil company for the british government so it was not anymore a private company it was a british interest as a matter of fact and in the course of the twentieth century although it helped the modernization in iran but it also helped the creation of a more authoritarian more strong state if you like to call it that it does that nineteenth century iran never had that kind of a power never had that kind of resources is it twentieth century even that one fifth of the income that reached the iranian state gave it a greater power that's another coincidence so yes yes you could say the oil was one of the catalysts for absolute power but the twentieth century saw quite a few countries have dictators with power unlike anything else in human history yes that's weird too precisely and you know you can name them from the beginning of the century with people like i don't know lenin or stalin of course hitler even mao mao of course okay you can name them and probably as i would say is the last of them is khomeini in that century that you would see this strong man with a sense of either a artificial or real or a sense of a so called charisma mhmm and with this total power over the regime that they create in the some of them do nasser he didn't have much of an oil resources in egypt but he was also one of these strong men okay in the twentieth century loved by some hated by others so it necessarily does not tie up to to resource economic resources underground but in the iranian case unfortunately it did and it was a it was more than it created more than one issue for iran it's created a strong state which is the pahlavi state from nineteen twenty one onward because in nineteen twenty one at the end of the first world war iran was in a almost a state of total bankruptcy and the british had a desire to try to bring iran to the system that they created in the middle east in the post war era the mandate system palestine iraq and then of course french mandate of lebanon and syria all of this and iran was separate because iran was an independent country it wasn't part of the ottoman empire that collapsed so they had to somehow handle it mhmm and what they tried to do didn't work as a result partly domestic partly international issues brought about a regime which is headed by the founder of the pahlavi dynasty reza shah okay the first military officer called reza khan actually a military officer of the cossack forces and the cossack forces was the force that was created in the nineteenth century model of the russian cossacks mhmm when the ruler in the nineteenth century visited russia as in a royal tour and the desire showed the great cossack forces he said i like this and he created one for himself with russian officers actually mhmm so russian officers served in iran from around eighteen eighties up to the revolution of nineteen seventeen the collapse of the yeah the saris regime so many revolutions so many revolutions and reza shah was an officer in that reza khan yeah was an officer in that force and he created a new monarchy for reasons that we need not to go to and it's called the pahlavi regime pahlavi regime was a modernizing regime okay that brought a comp in in effect fulfilled many of the ambitions of the constitution many of the aspirations of the constitution better communication but secular education centralized states and centralized army better contact with the outside world greater urbanization that's what a modern state is all about mhmm and in that regard in a sense for the first twenty years up to the second world war was successful despite and more significant of all it managed to keep the european powers which is always interfering in the local affairs of iran in an arm length so they were there in an arm length but they were also re respecting the power of the state power of the palavi state during the second second world war the same phenomenon as earlier interference led to the occupation of iran by the allied forces the british from the south the russians from the north the red army mhmm they took over iran and of course they set just during world war yes from nineteen forty one up to nineteen forty five and of course when the when the red army refused to withdraw from iranian azerbaijan and with some thought of possible annexation of that province there was a big issue in the post war iran so after nineteen forty five yes nineteen forty five to nineteen forty six there was a big soviet union getting greedy yes but eventually they agreed eventually stalin agreed to leave the azerbaijan province in the hope that it would get some concessions from iran which in in the oil of the caspian era area which didn't work and it's a different story altogether but what happened is that in the post war era between nineteen forty four forty five and nineteen fifty three is a period of greater democratization was that researcher's dictatorship basically disappeared and this is where you would see political parties free press a lot of chaotic really as as democracies often are so something like was it was it officially a democracy yes it was a democracy was there elections there were elections yes of course yes of course and there were very diverse political tendencies came to the picture including the two party of iran which is communist party of iran this communist party of iran is probably the biggest communist party of the whole of the middle east and one of the biggest in the world actually at that time did the soviet union have a significant influence on the of course they were basically following orders from the soviets although they deny it but in reality that's the case yeah but what happened they were seen by the americans during the cold war as a as a threat and iran was going through a period of demanding nationalization of its oil resources that's a very important episode with mossadegh whom you might have heard about his name doctor mohammed mosaddegh who was the prime minister and the national charismatic leader from nineteen fifty one to nineteen fifty three prior to that he was a famous parliamentarian but this period he was a prime minister of iran and he nationalized the iranian oil industry and the british didn't like it at all and eventually resulted in a famous coup which at least partly was supported by the funding and by the moral support of the british and the americans particularly by the americans it was always seen as one of the earliest and the most successful cia operations during the cold war so cia had something to do with yes of course that's one of the earliest operations of the cia wait a minute what what was yes of course what was the c what was the cia doing cia this is the time at the post war era in the fifties in the fifties forties and fifties the british empire which was really the major superpower of the region after the collapse of the entire empire gradually took the second seat to the americans who were the newcomers and the great powers and the victors of the second world war and the americans viewed iran as an important as an important country since it has the largest common borders with the soviet union and it's what and the the south was the persian gulf which at the time was the greatest supplier of oil to the outside world and therefore the americans had a particular interest in iran and in the earlier stages their interest was in the interest of the iranian government because they wanted to get rid of both the soviet union which made which made a return in the post war era and of course the british that were gradually withdrawing from iran but they they had a full control over the anglo iranian oil company they changed the name to anglo iranian oil company when the name of the country officially changed from persia to iran in the west the name of the company changed and they got into a huge dispute with the mossadir government that eventually led to the coup of nineteen fifty three which eventually created a very very distressful memory in the minds of many of the iranian nationalists that this was the betrayer of the great powers the british and americans yes cia played a part because cia feared contrary to the british that they were afraid of their own oil in iran the cia was afraid of the soviet penetration in in the south and particularly because there was a very powerful political a very powerful communist party in the two day party of iran so they gradually shifted between the truman administration and our eisenhower administration these are early days of the cia mhmm and then they actually did participate to send their agents there's a long story to that and it eventually resulted in a successful coup that removed mosaddegh from power what's the united states' interest here why are they using cia are they trying to make sure there's not too much centralization of power in this region they were afraid of the fact that the that of the soviet union and during the cold war that was their concern all the concern they they actually almost wanna protect iran and its own sovereign processes from influence of the soviets yes because they were afraid of the fact if iran or at least this is part of the i'm i'm simplifying a very complex picture but the but but the americans basically were thinking that if iran is going to be lost choose soviet influence then eventually basically the all the all resources in the persian gulf are going to be threatened yeah and if and this would basically use the national security of the united states and the all of the western allies european allies so in a sense this was the long arm of the cia to try to to try to make sure that that's not going to happen and then of course they were persuaded by the british because british were the old hand which were in iran since the beginning of the nineteenth century they always had relations with iran and so forth so they gradually replaced mhmm and and of course i don't want to give them this kind of a satanic view that american was a bad influence because they had also some very good influences in iraq but this particular episode somehow shed a dark light on the american presence and was used and abused time and again particularly the revolution nine nineteen seventy nine which was this great satan idea that khomeini created basically it was based on the fact is nineteen fifty three you were responsible for the downfall of a national government in iran which as a matter of fact he had no respect for it khomeini had no respect for the national secular national liberals including muhammad musadiah but he was using it as a as a rhetorical tool for his own purposes but what happened is that after nineteen fifty three we see again the rise of authoritarian muhammad reza shah's power and then he is that's the shah that's the shah that we know as shah this is son of reza shah and technically what what is shah is it shah is an old term in persia that comes from a pre islamic persian of ancient times so in the context of democracy should it be seen as like a supreme leader king is the head of the executive power according to the constitution of nineteen o six oh that's in the constitution the actual term shah has a place in the constitution but the actual term shah okay interesting but the shah is a very old term as a yeah it's almost like a monarchic term like a it is like a king yeah it is actually is a term peculiar to iran i've written about it somewhere but because the term that the western world in the ancient times has been rex for royalty and the king in the eastern world in india is raj it's the same origin mhmm the same root iran never shared that they had the idea of because rex and raj i don't want to get into the too much of a etymology but this is an interesting one yeah rex and raj both means the one that opens the road for basically enforcer of religion okay in enforcer of the right religion because rex and raj both have the of the etymological origin of right you see and right means the right religion basically by the way there's so much beautiful language here i'm just looking at the the persian constitution in nineteen o six and it says it's the constitution of the sublime state of persia yeah pajar iran i mean just just the extra adjectives on top of this stuff is beautiful i mean yeah because that was actually the change that came about i don't want to go too much into it but it was called as i pointed out before the guarded domains of iran yes they changed that to the sublime state of iran during the constitutional revolution because they wanted to give a greater sense of centrality of the state yeah and sublime was the term was used but also what permeates all of this is a is a poetic i mean there is a history of poetry of course very strong to the culture very strong just fascinating so i mean it's i i of course i don't speak the language but even in in russian there's also a music to the soul of the people that represents itself that presents itself in the form of poetry and literature in the way that it doesn't in the in the english speaking world i don't know what that is there's yeah there's a romantic side romantic side yes romantic side that's right yeah i agree with you in iran of course you know this is a time of the constitution revolution is a time of great poetry this kind of patriotic sentiments that comes through poetry plays a very important part yeah of course these days poetry has kind of declined and instead you see the visual image that is at the center that's why cinema is so important kids these days with their tiktok yeah let me finish this about this period of mohammad reza shah he built up because he received a greater income from the oil revenue and he built up a very strong state with a strong security force a strong security apparatus which is the is the which is a acronym for the security force in security organization and he of course unfortunately in the nineties sixties and seventies particularly in ninety seventies basically suppressed the voices of or a possibility of any kind of a mass participation in the political process it became very much an authoritarian regime with its own technocrats very much a modernist vision of of of of iran's future and almost kind of messianic that he was hoping that iran in a decade would become the fifth most powerful state in the world and reaches as he would have said the gates of the great civilization very much in the mind had this image of ancient iran of the achaemenid empire and we want to go back to that greatness of the achaemenid empire somewhat rather naive and very nationalistic in a crude fashion and what happened is that as a result there was built up some kind of a resistance from the intellectuals from the left eventually resulting in a kind of a protest movement as i said by nineteen seventy seven nineteen seventy eight then of course the question that comes to mind and they probably it you you you would like to know about is the fact that why it becomes religious why it become islamic if it's the popular you know nationalist liberal tendency of opening up the political space and allowing greater participation going back to the constitution of nineteen o six nineteen o seven why it's all of a sudden it becomes khomeini where does he come from the reason for that at least in a concise fashion is the fact that on one area that after the greater suppression of all the other voices remained open was religion mosques the mullahs on the pulpit and the message that gradually shifted from the older traditional message of the sharia of islam i mean all the rules and regulations of how one has to live into something very political and not only political but also radical political mhmm so in the whole period from the revolution to the revolution of nineteen seventy nine basically the religious establishment gradually was pushed to the opposition they were not originally very conservative supported us of state as the catholic church for instance was supported of majority of the authoritarian governments around the world but the politicization was the result of isolation because they were left out of the system and while in isolation they did they did not they were not successful in trying to reform themselves to try to become to try to find answers to many of the questions of modern times what happens to women what happens to civil rights what happens to a civil society mhmm how modern law and individual freedoms have to be defined in islamic terms how to separate religion and state or how to separate the religion and state these issues were never addressed what happened is that there was this bypass through put political islam and revolutionary islam as it gradually they learned you know that this is the bypass bypass to power basically to become again a voice in the society and eventually a prominent voice and eventually monolithic voice in the society that's the process that led into the revolution of nineteen seventy nine basically this period greater attention was paid to religion even among the secular middle classes who were alienated for a very long time because of this extensive modernization of the pahlavi period they had they didn't have a sense of that old with their turbans but they became they had a kind of aura in this period yes they are those who remained not corrupted mhmm they are the people who basically went against the suppression of the pahlavi regime and khomeini became a leader a symbol of that nobody ever thought in the earlier stages and this very excited multitudes that came to the streets of the iranian cities in nineteen seventy nine or nineteen seventy eight actually real thought that this this old model in its seventies that all of a sudden has appeared from najaf through paris to tehran is going to take over and create a a autocracy a religious autocracy we have to back up for just a second who who is khomeini who you just you just mentioned a few desperate facts about the man yes he was the person that took power in nineteen seventy nine supreme leader of iran yes some you mentioned something about paris something about being in the seventies yes like what what should we know about the guy ayatollah khomeini who eventually was known as imam khomeini he was kind of promoted to a even more sublime position okay okay can we just a million tangents ayatollah im imam what do these terms mean well ayatollah means the sign of god mhmm in the course of the nineteenth century or early twentieth century as the religious establishment gradually lost its greater presence in the society and its prominent places in the society they had some kind of an inflation in titles so they gave themselves more grand titles yeah more adjectives more adjectives more grand titles such as ayatollah that became a kind of a highest rank of the religious hierarchy but it's not incidentally was in on in a unofficial hierarchy it was not it's not like the chris like catholic church that you have you know bishops and you know feather up it was very unofficial mother mhmm and he was an ayatollah was eventually recognized as an ayatollah well he he wasn't the first ayatollah no no no not at all the ayatollahs were before him ever since the beginning of the century but he was eventually recognized as an ayatollah and if i want to start it this way ayatollah khomeini was born in nineteen hundred and in a sense all this tremendous change that iran witnessed in the course of the twentieth century was in a sense materializing this person he become a mullah of a lower rank went to the traditional madrassas to the traditional centers for the education of the seminarians never had a secular education had a very complex islamic education on this one hand jurisprudence on the other hand probably a little bit of islamic philosophy and mysticism which is unusual for the for the for the as they call them this religious scholars or or legal scholars of islam and then he in the nineteen sixties when he was residing in tehran and gradually becoming more important he became a voice of opposition against the shah and the reason for opposition in the nineteen sixties early nineteen sixties was the fact that the shaw carried through a series of extensive modernization policies of which the most important was the land reform so in effect the land distribution that took place in the early sixties removed or weakened greatly that class of land owners from the from the nineteenth century and he khomeini saw himself as a voice of that old class that felt that actually declared that this land redistribution is on islamic according to the islamic law property is property is honored and you cannot just no matter how much and how large are these estates that the land owning class has the government has no right to redistribute it even among the peasants among among the people who are tilling the land so that was a major issue shaw also gave the right of vote to women and that also he objected he says that women should not have a right can can we just linger on the islamic law how firm and clear is the islamic law that he was representing and embodying is this codified codified yes that's a good term yeah yeah that's another issue not only the hierarchy was unofficial and informal but also islamic law particularly shi'i law did not have any codified system because this religious authorities always resisted becoming under a umbrella of a more codified system of islamic law because they were outside the state in a sense civil civil law was in the hand of the religious establishment they had their own courts independent of the state but other matters of legal matters was in the hand of the government there was a kind of in de facto division between these two institutions state versus the religious establishment therefore it was not codified so he could declare that this is unofficial oh i'm sorry illegal according to the islamic law that you would distribute land to the peasants and another or another religious authority would say no no it's perfectly fine because he would have a different reading of the law right so that being in mind that adds to the complexity of the picture he in the nineteen sixty three there was a period of uprising of the supporters of ayatollah khomeini that was a turning point in a sense to try to politicize the religious supporters of ayatollah who were loyal to ayatollah khomeini and in a sense all the community of more religiously orientated against the secular policies of the shah and against of course the dictatorship of the shah so that's where the religious movement became a political party in nineteen sixty three is the first moment it's a huge uprising so and the government suppressed it and but then suppression yes would start to build of course and he was sent to exile he went to najaf which is this great center in southern so became a martyr on top of this at the martyr he was probably even forgotten to some extent but not it was forgotten for the for the secular middle class but not to those supporters of his who were paying him their dues because in islam you would pay dues to religious leaders you know there's religious dues and arms that you could pay to the clerical authorities and they redistribute them among their own students and so forth so they built actually a network of loyalty based on these donations and these donations that's received by was very effectively through his network mhmm was distributed even if he was in exile at sadira so the nineteen seventy seven nineteen seventy eight when the situation changed and there was a little bit of opening in the political climate then you saw that ayatollah khomeini start sending cassette messages that was his mean of communication we're sending cassettes and cassettes were sent through the country by his network so or declarations and saying first that we would like to see a greater democratization and the shah has to abide by the constitution of nineteen o seven this is a constitution this is a democratic system and so forth was he charismatic well it depends who would call what do you call charismatic he had a long beard he was kind of a man in turban and the gown which was a very unusual leadership for people who were much more accustomed to the civilian clothing or to the equipments of the shah's military uniforms that he used to wear but i also mean like he is a man that was able to take power to become popular sufficiently popular so like i i would like is it the ideas is it an accident or is it the man himself the charisma or something about the man that led to this particular person basically changing the tide of history in this part of the world in a way that is unexpected all the above that you mentioned or was it just the beard no i think no it's beyond the appearance because the appearance is greatly helps as you know yeah you know in the twentieth century appearance is helpful yeah pictures for propaganda for messaging that's an important factor adamant and very severe in his own positions he could appear very uncompromising and he had a sense of confidence self confidence that virtually everybody else lacked and he was a man of opportunity as soon as he would see that a chance and opportunity would open up he would jump on it and that's what he did basically as more the political space opened the weaknesses of the shah's government became more evident his indecision became more evident his lack of confidence became more evident khomeini managed to move further into the center of the movement because he was the only authority that had this network of support through the mosques through the people who paid homage to him who followed him because there's a sense of following of the religious leader in shiza you are a follower of this authority you're a follower of that authority and he's basically created an environment in which people looked upon him as a kind of a messianic figure yeah that came to save iran from what they considered at the time the problems of dictatorship under the shah so there's not a suspicion about islamic law being the primary law of the land not at all people had very little sense that what islamic law is all about because the secular education has left that into the old religious schools this is not something that ordinary educated iranian who goes to the universities is going to learn therefore there is a sense of idealization that there is something great there that is and there were quite a number of intellectuals who also viewed this kind of an idea of they would refer to as less toxication mhmm that is this civilization of the west that has brought with it all the modernity that we see around ourselves has its enormous sinister features into it mhmm and it has taken away from us our authenticity that was the thing that there is something authentic that should be protected and therefore a man in that kind of a garb and appearance seemed as a source for return to this originality of their own culture authenticity of their own culture and he perfectly took advantage of that that is khomeini took advantage of it and the circle around him at the expense of everybody else which he managed in the course of nineteen seventy nine to nineteen eighty nine which he passed away died in the ten years during this period managed to basically transform the iranian society to create institutions of the islamic republic and to acquire himself the position of the guardian jurists that was something completely new it didn't ever existed before as a matter of fact as you might know the model of government that a religious establishment takes over the states is unprecedented throughout the course of iranian history throughout the course of the islamic history i would say this is the first example and probably the only example of a of a regime that the religious establishment that has always in the course of iranian history ever since i would say probably at the sixteenth century if not earlier has been always separate from this state and always kind of collaborating with the state in a with a certain tensions in between the two of them there were two basically as they would call themselves the two pillars of stability in the society that situation changed for the first time the religious establishment took over the power of the state and that's at the core of what we see today as a major issue for iranian society because these are basically that old balance between the religion and the state which was kind of a de facto separation of the authorities of the two has been violated and now you have in power a a theocracy in effect which of course only in the set on the on in its appearance is theocracy deep down it's a in my opinion it's a brutal fascist regime that it stays in power but it has the appearance of religion into it so this is really the story of the revolution and as a result of that the iranian middle classes greatly suffered it's not without a reason that you see four million iranians abroad because basically the emergence of this new power gradually isolated or marginalized the secular middle class who could not survive under that regime and gradually moved out in the course of perhaps thirty forty years up to now iran has the largest i think i'm i'm right to say so has the largest brain drain in any country in the world so due to its population so fascinating that how much of a weird quirk of history is it that that religion would take hold in a country like does it have to do with the individual it seems like if we reran the twentieth century a thousand times will we get the seventy nine revolution resulting in islamic law like less than you know one percent of the time it feels like or no what what percentage would you put on well i think it has something to do with the very complex nature of how iran evolved over a long period of time since the sixteenth century that's why if i would for a moment talk about what i have written i've written a book that's called iran and modern history mhmm and it does not start in the twentieth century it starts in the sixteenth century yeah because it that's what i have argued that this complex process that at the end of the day resulted in what we see around us today is something that was in making for a very long time and religion was a big part of it yeah she and the the the messiah complex yeah exactly the the the longing for this great vision of a great nation that somehow is the the sublime nation that can only be fully sublime through through religion or at the time it was thought that it's true religion ever since then it's disillusionment with that image yeah or at least a process of disillusionment the outcome of it is what we see today basically that process of forty years is a process of readjusting to the realities of the world that that great moment of romantic success of a revolution like most revolutions of course that is going to change iran and bring this kind of a moment of greatness led into this great disappointment it's a movement of the great disappointment in a sense like most messianic movements by the way messianic movements in general are always leading into great disappointments but what i have here that perhaps should be added to it that yes it was a peculiarity of iran as a society that had to experience this eventual encounter between religion and state that's something to do with the nature of shiza that's just one point that should be pointed out most of sunni islam don't have that kind of i say most because there is something there but sunni islam in general does not have that kind of an aspiration for the coming of a messianic leader does is very shaping particularly the way that it was set up in iran was a religion that has always this element of expectation to it for the coming of this messianic leader of course i mean between practices all societies look for messianic leaders and just look around us but some societies more than others there's certain culture it might have to do with the romantic poetry that we mentioned earlier it i mean surely i mean not to draw too many parallels but with the soviet union there is romanticism too and i mean i don't know there there it it does maybe idealism a sense of his savior yeah who would who would bring you out of the misery that you're in and and always looking for a for a third party to solve your issues that's why probably this movement has a particular significance because it's probably doesn't look for a messiah although i was talking to my brother who is a historian also and he was saying perhaps the messiah of this movement is that masai amini mhmm the twenty two year old girl that was killed so a martid messiah mhmm who is now leading a movement which no longer has that charismatic leadership with it but yes i would say that iran has been the birthplace if i might say that of messianic aspirations going back to the ancient zoroastrianism which is the really the whole system that you see in major religions or at least best so called western religions so abrahamic religions is parallel or perhaps influenced by zoroastrianism in which there is an idea of this world and the other world there's a hereafter there is an idea of a judgment at the end of the time and there is a concept that there is a moment of justice that is going to come with the rise of a religious or a charismatic fear so it's a very old phenomenon in iran very old and it's time and the game repeated itself in the course of its history but never as powerfully as it happened in nineteen seventy nine and never in the form of authority from within the religious establishment it was always the descent movements that were kind of antinomian they were against the authority of the religious establishment that changed in the twentieth century but the revolution nineteen seventy nine that change is still with us today what we can we just linger on are there some practical games of power that occurred you know in the way that stalin took power and held power in the early days is there something like this in terms of the establishment of the revolutionary guard and all those kinds of stuff yes yeah so it's the the messianic figure has some support from the people but does he have to crush his enemies in competition it certainly did probably not certainly not as brutal in terms of the victims as you would see in soviet union under stalin who the bloodshed or the destruction of the population was far greater than what you would find in iran of the islamic republic it's uncomfortable perhaps i would find a greater parallel with mao zedong and particularly because china has a very strong messianic tradition since the ancient times so they have something and mao appeared as a kind of a messianic figure there i can see there is a parallel but also you can see with any other authoritarian regime with the messianic fear at the head of it that it destroys all the other forces so during the course of the first ten years of the islamic revolution it destroyed the liberal nationalist secular it destroyed the guerrilla movements some of them islamic some of them marxist who turned into political parties or tendencies in the course of the post revolution in nineteen seventy nine they were completely destroyed and in a very brutal fashion and the their opposition even within the religious establishment because it wasn't a uniform there were many different tendencies those that were opposed to the authority of ayatollah khomeini or not imam khomeini meaning almost a sacred religious figure above the level of a religious authority he's a saint kind of a figure so she's has this idea of imams there were eleven of them the twelve is hidden and would come back at the end of the time this is a messianic year so the title that was always used for them only in shi'ism never used for any other person he is the first person in the revolution of nineteen seventy nine first referred to as deputy of imam but the term deputy gradually disappeared and he became imam khomeini that's his official title i love human beings so much it's so beautiful these titles that we give each other it's it's marvelous to observe love it because you haven't been under that system no i i love it in the way i love it in a very dark dark fashion kind of way it caricatures itself it's it's almost funny in its absurdity if not for the evil that it has led to in human history but but also the fact that it's a man it's in fact fulfillment in a kind of completely unintended fashion mhmm it's a fulfillment of that idea of a messiah that they've been fighting for this imam which is in a for a thousand years is here and not here and therefore khomeini would have in a sense fulfilled those anticipations but beyond that i just give you one example i know that you may have other concerns but when i say elimination at the end of the iran iraq war by the direct order of ayatollah khomeini a fatwa that he wrote a group of prisoners who belong to variety of political parties the left religious left majority of them the left and the the marxist left and the religious left in a matter of a few weeks or perhaps a few months i'm not actually quite sure about the the time span in a series of these were people who have already been tried and they were given sentences they were brought back before the summary trials of three judges or or more three four of them one of them is now the new president of the islamic republic raisi and they were given a quick summary sentences which meant execution so something between probably six to eight thousand were executed in matter of a month or two months something like that mostly in tehran but also in provinces and that remained an extraordinary trauma for the families for those who had these kids in they're all young all young so this remains very much kind of original sin of the islamic republic that cannot get rid of and it's in people's memories they didn't allow them even the families to go and mourn their dead in a an official cemetery which they created for them now the latest thing is that they put a huge concrete wall around it so nobody would be able to get into it so these all part of this extraordinary level of level of atrocity brutality that you see that the regime who claimed that it comes with the morality of religion and islam to bring back to justice and and and be more in a sense kind to people ended up with what it is in the memory of many of the people in iran so developing these fascistic tendencies very much so destroying minorities baha'i is one of them hundreds of baha'is were without any reason without any involvement were picked up and executed the properties were taken over their rights were taken away from them even up to this day it's the largest by the way religious minority in iran so you would see that in many areas this is a acts very much as an beyond authoritarian it's a kind of really a fascistic regime so khamenei held power for ten years and then took power the next supreme leader who is still the leader today for over thirty years who is he well he was one of the this is ali khamenei ayatollah ayatollah ali khamenei one day perhaps no well they they hesitated to use the term imam for him but in any other respect he was given all of that adulation yes that they did to khamenei he is the guardian jurist that's what's important because the guardian jurist in the constitution of the islamic republic is an authority that is above the state mhmm he is not elected quote unquote because this is a divine authority although he has been designated by the group of the turbaned mullahs like himself and he has the full power over all institutions of the state the army the media the economy every aspect of he acts like a show mhmm he acts like this authoritarian authority did that gradually develop or was that very early on well that's part of the constitution of the islamic republic the first constitution and the first draft of the constitution did not have the authority of the guardian juries mhmm but then it was added by khomeini and his supporters are there actual in the constitution any limits to his power yes there is a council of the experts so to say that would remove him from power i think theoretically but there's so much restrictions to that that i don't think it would have ever happened in reality in his case at least but in terms of executive to make decisions and all that kind of stuff does he need to check with anybody no oh boy he does check with his own advisers but he's he doesn't have any he doesn't have any constitutional obligation to check on the decisions that he's making so that's the supreme leader but there's been presidents yes and what's the role of the president the president in a sense is the executive power under the islamic republic there are three heads of powers there's there's the president that presumably has the executive power there is the head of the judiciary and there is the head of the the speaker of the parliament majlis islamic majlis which is the the legislative so there's a legislative judiciary and executive raisi who is now the president is the head of the executive above them is the supreme leader or the guardian jurist can you give me some insight because i especially i'm not exactly sure why but the president ahmadinejad is somebody i'm as an american really familiar with why is that exactly but why was why was a president the public facing person to the world versus the supreme leader is that just a accident of a particular humans involved or is this by design no because the supreme leader tries to keep himself out of issues of everyday politics supposedly yeah but therefore he is not coming to united nations to give a speech during the session but mister ahmed dineshurtu at the time was the president would come and make outrageous statements that's why you probably know something about it so all of them make public statements but he had a proclivity for outrageous statements he does all kinds of things he makes all kinds of statements but he is somewhat above the everyday politics in theory but of course he's pulling all the strings with without doubt in every rest respect and it seems that you were asked i thought you're going to ask me this question almost without a an exception since the inception of the islamic republic in nineteen seventy nine up to the last of the presidents of the islamic republic rouhani before the guy that is last year or a year and a half ago was in a phony election got into the position of the president all of them and it's a long list all of them eventually fell out with the regime mhmm so there is no president except perhaps to some extent rouhani but we'll wait and see what's going to happen to him but prior to him all of them including ahmadinejad fell out with the regime with the current regime in iraq who's rohan he's he was officially president for eight years yeah prior to raisi ibrahim raisi the two twenty one the the you're what you're saying is a phony election yes it's a phony election what what happens what what what what what's the situation happen because the process of actually candidacy for presidency is completely controlled by a a council that is under the control of the supreme leader so they have to approve who is going to be the candidate so why did they everybody can enter and say i would like to be a candidate so did did rouhani fall out of favor you're saying there's some yeah well he is kind of out of favor now because he was more moderate than this this most recent regime but the point is that if you look this is something almost institutional cons constitutional to the regime this is a regime that rejects all of the executive powers because it's because the division between the supreme authority as this place of a supreme authority versus the presidency has problematic it is as if there would be a a a supreme leader in the united states above all the three sources of power that's the kind of any view that you can see in today's iran and of course he is at the focus of all the criticism that he receives from the demonstrators in today's iran so on top of all this recently and throughout the last several years us and iran are in the midst of nuclear deal negotiations this is another part of the story of iran is the development of nuclear weapons the nuclear program they're looking to restore the nuclear deal known as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa what is the history the present and the future of these negotiations over nuclear weapons what is interesting to you in this full context from the sixteenth century of the messianic yeah journey what's interesting to you here you can argue that for a long time even under the shah but much more expressively and decisively under the islamic republic there was a determination to have a nuclear power or nuclear weapon mhmm in a sense i think the bottom line of all the negotiations everything else is that iran of the islamic republic had the tendency of having its own nuclear weapon the reason for that is that iran was subject of nearly nine years eight and a half years of iran iraq war when not only iran faced an aggressor iraq that actually attacked iran at a very critical time at the very beginning of the iranian revolution but the fact that iran felt kind of a helpless in the course of this war and has to make great sacrifices actually which supported the islamic regime and consolidated the islamic regime because of this war and most of the time their support of the united states was behind iraq vis a vis iran and iran felt that it's been isolated and has to protect itself so there is some argument for having a nuclear capabilities but in reality this has resulted in this completely mindless crazy wasteful attempt on the side of the iranian regime to try to develop a nuclear power mhmm and therefore the rest of the world particularly in this region were very worried that if iran would get access to a nuclear weapon then the entire region of the persian gulf might particularly saudi arabia possibly turkey possibly egypt all of them may require may may demand to have also nuclear weapon given the fact that pakistan and india has already have it so there was a determined attempt as you might know on the side of the western communities or now gradually world communities to try to as much as possible to control iran from getting access to a nuclear capability or actually limit iran's nuclear capabilities to what was defined usually in a euphemism as a peaceful fashion okay that being said there was also israel which viewed the islamic republic as a arch enemy and some of it might be due to the israelis own exaggeration of iran's threat and some of it is because iran has developed a fairly strong military as we see it today and as such this attempt to try to prevent iran from ever getting access to nuclear weapon which resulted as you might know in this massive sanctions that were imposed upon iran ever since the beginning of the revolution in nineteen seventy nine and of course more intensively since two thousand fifteen two thousand sixteen even prior to that probably a little bit earlier this this agreement the nuclear agreement was supposed to control or monitor iranian nuclear industry or nuclear setup in exchange for removing the sanctions what this never worked in a matter of fact in a very successful satisfactory way for the iranians or for the americans particularly under trump administration which i think foolishly decided to scrap the agreement that was reached under president obama like many other policies that was implemented under trump administration this created a major problem that is how to under biden how to try to come up with a new nuclear agreement with iran in this process since two thousand sixteen where the united states withdraw from the agreement iran felt comfortable to try to go and do whatever they want without any kind of monitor being monitored by the international community and that's the situation now we don't know whether iran is really sincere under the present regime to negotiate a deal we don't know that every united states is willing to do so and it seems that now what is happening in terms of the protests in the iranian streets makes it even harder in public eye to try to negotiate a deal with iran because that means in the minds of many and with some justification that if the nuclear agreement would result in the removal of many of these sanctions millions billions as the result of the removal of the sanctions and iran's ability to sell it it's all in the international market without any restrictions means that the iranian government is going to become even more powerful more financially secure in order to suppress its own people so that's the agreement that goes against coming to terms with with iran but the problem is that there is no clear alternative even i'm not particularly personally favorable for this agreement to be to to be ratified but the alternative is very difficult there's no way to try to see what can be done geopolitics where every alternative is terrible let me ask you about one of the most complex geopolitical situations in history one aspect of it is the cold war between iran and israel the bigger picture of it is sometimes referred to as israel palestine conflict what are all the parties nations involved what are the interests that are involved what's the rhetoric can you understand make the case for each side of this conflict you're opening a new can of worms that it takes another three hours of of of conversation just three hours at least what what i can tell you is this iran prior to nineteen seventy nine viewed itself under the shah as a kind of a if not supporter of israel was in very good terms with israel they had an embassy in iran or unofficial embassy in iran they had certain projects that's helping with the agriculture and so forth in iran but since nineteen seventy nine that completely reversed yeah part of it is that the issue of the palestinian plight remained very much at the heart of the revolutionary iranians who would see that part of the united states is to support part of the united states guilt sin is to support israel visa v it's very suppressive very oppressive treatment of the palestinians completely illegal taking over of the territories which is not theirs since nineteen sixty seven and therefore it is upon the iranian regime iranian islamic republic to support the cause of the palestinians this came about at the time when the rest of the support for the palestinians including arab nationalism basically reached the stage of bankruptcy i mean much of the regimes of the arab world either are now coming to terms with israel or in one way or another because of their own contingencies because of their own concerns and interests are willy nilly accepting israel in the in the region now that old task of rhetorically supporting the palestinians falls upon the islamic republic that sees itself as a champion of the palestinians now without as a matter of fact having either the support of the iranian people behind him him if you ask if tomorrow there would be a poll or a referendum i would doubt that eighty percent of the iranian people would approve of the policies of the islamic republic vis a vis the issue of palestine nor the palestinians themselves because the islamic republic is only supporting those factions within the palestinian movement which are islamic quote unquote and even within that they there is problems with hamas for instance but nevertheless it's for the islamic republic some kind of a propaganda tool to be able to use it for its own sake and claim that we are the champions of the palestinian people whether they have a solution if you look at their rhetoric if you listen to their rhetoric it's the destruction of the state of israel and that it seems to me creates a certain anxiety in the minds of the israelis israeli population and israeli government particularly those who are now in power netanyahu the likud and more kind of a right wing politics of policy of today's israel that being said i think also the israelis try to get an extra mileage out of threats of iran quote unquote in order to present themselves a rightful to for terms of security and whatever else the way that they are treating the palestinians which i think is extremely unjust i think it's extremely unwise for israel to carry on with these policies as they did since sixty seven at least and not to try to come to terms with it of course there are huge amount of i'm not denying that at all the huge amount of failures mistakes and stupidity on the side of the palestinian leadership in various stages not to try to make a deal or try to come to terms in some fashion but it's a very complex picture and it's rather unfair to the palestinians to accuse them for not coming to terms with israel under a very uneven circumstances when they are not in a position to try to make a fair deal in terms of the territories or in terms of their security in future vis a vis israel so i think there is as you probably know quite a lot of people that would have a different perspective than you just stated in terms of you know taking the perspective of israel and characterizing the situation can you steel man that their side can you steel man israel's side that they're trying to be a sovereign nation trying to protect themselves against threats ultimately wanting to create a place of safety a place where people can pursue all all the things that you wanna pursue in life including foremost happiness i tend to agree with you and i have all the respect for the fact that israel would like to create security and happiness for its own people but there are two arguments one is a moral argument to my mind as a historian jews across around the world for all through their history suffered and this is a history of suffering it's a history of memory of suffering and i find it enormously difficult to believe that a nation is a product of so much sacrifice suffering loss of life and variety of holocaust above all would find itself in a position not to give the proper justice to a people who could be their neighbors and that is a moral argument which i cannot believe under any circumstances can be accepted second in real terms what do you want to you want to commit a genocide you have a population there that you have to come to terms with it and you cannot just postpone as they did six sixty seven they are postponing and hoping that it goes away somehow i don't think it's going to go away and and it's going to get worse right and better it's a long nuanced discussion and i look forward to having it so we'll just leave it there for the moment but it is a stressful place in the world where the rhetoric is existential where iran makes claims that it wants to wipe a country off the face of the earth it's just the level of of intensity of rhetoric is unlike anywhere else in the world and extremely dangerous and in in both directions so one the real danger of the rhetoric actually being acted upon and then the extreme political parties using the rhetoric to justify even a greater escalation so if iran is saying that this is it's saying that they're wanting to wipe israel off the face of the earth that justifies any response on the other side on the other side of course i tend to agree with you fully and unfortunately this is a very critical situation that this region is facing iran in particular i would say that i hope that in the minds of the people of israel there is a enough or common sense to realize that probably escalation on the israeli side is not in the favor of anybody and try to let the iranians to go on with their empty rhetoric as they do so far yeah but at the same time i cannot deny the fact that you know there is a danger on the side of this regime and what it says it cannot be denied nobody can justify that particularly because the iranian population is not behind this regime certainly in the case of the palestinians or for that matter it's not palestine it's the the the islamic republic's involvement in lebanon with hezbollah it's the islamic republic's involvement in syria with bashar assad its involvement in other parts of the world perhaps even yemen that all of them creates extraterritorial responsibilities or interventions unnecessary interventions that ultimately is not in favor of best interest of the iranian people or iran as a country iran has never been involved in this kind of politics before of the islamic republic so in a sense the iranian regime it seems to me by going to the extreme try to create for itself a space that it did not have or did not deserve to have within the politics of the region it's a so in other words that has become part of the tool a kind of an instrument for if you like to call it some kind of an expansionism of of the regime in parts of the world where it can see there is a possibility for its presence for its expansion of course historically speaking iran ever since fifteenth century i think that's the earliest example i can see in mother in early mother times has always a tendency of moving in the direction of not only what is today the state of iraq but further into the eastern coast of mediterranean so that's a long term ambition that has been in the cards as far as iran as a strategic unity is concerned but by no means justified and by no means could be a reasonable could be a sane policy of a nation state as today's iran but the second point is that also regimes are always victims of their own rhetoric so it's once you keep repeating something then you become more and more committed to it and it cannot remain anymore in the level of rhetoric you have to do something about it so it's a something compelling pressure to try to to to materialize what you've been saying in your rhetoric and that is even extremely more dangerous as far as iran is concerned and it brings it to some unholy alliances that today we are witnessing iran is getting involved even more dangerous than this rhetoric in in terms of the visa v israel is its involvement with russia and to some extent with china which we can talk about what what do you think about the meeting between khamenei and vladimir putin in july what's that alliance what's that partnership is it surface level geopolitics or is there a deep growing connection i cannot see the difference between geopolitics and these deep connections forty years of distancing from the west in terms of the islamic republic and the fact that there is a shelf life to imperial presence yeah for any empire anywhere in the world so after the terrible experience of of the united states in iraq and in afghanistan pretty pretty much like the british empire that after this suez experience in fifty six decided to withdraw from east of suez maybe there is a moment here that we are witnessing or it may come that a great power like the united states sees in this benefit not to get too much involved into nitty gritty things in other parts of the world that it's not its immediate concern mhmm and i think that is part of the reason not the entire reason part of the reason why we see the emergence of a new geopolitical environment in this part of the world of which china russia possibly iran possibly turkey possibly both of them are going to be part mhmm perhaps saudis also but i doubt that the saudis under the present circumstances although we have witnessed some remarkable issue in the course of the past few weeks where the saudis giving assurances to american administration and then shifting and getting along with putin in terms of the oil production i think it's more than that even and it's not only dam but also the emirates are doing the same thing so what does that just tell us and that's another many hour conversation about the the oil industry in in iran and the the whole region in emerging yeah this kind of a world which was perhaps even ten years ago unimaginable yeah that you see now a great power china that it's going to remain from what we see around us as a great power and russia adventurous foolish but nevertheless would remain criminal i would say as far as the its behavior in ukraine but actually it's a rogue nation that it's attracts another rogue nation so iran finds itself now in a greater place place of security in alliance with russia in the hope that this would give iran a greater security in this part of the world whether this is whether this is realistic or illusion i think remains to be seen i think iran china relation makes more sense although if you ask ordinary iranians they don't like it they would tell why should we be tied up with with china as the only trade party with with america because of the foolish isolations that you have created for us because of all the sanctions that you have created for us the islamic republic so in a sense it's a very difficult question to answer probably iranians also like to be more on the other camp but what happens is that in real term what surprises me most is not this alliance with china but it's kind of becoming a lackey or subservient to putin's regime in in russia since if you look at it iran ever since at least the nineteenth century not going further back the beginning of the nineteenth century always viewed russia as the greatest threat strategically because it was sitting right at the top of iran it was it was infinitely more powerful than iran mhmm has ever been and iran fought two rounds of war at the beginning of the century lost the entire caucuses to russia and learned its lesson that you have to be mindful of russia and you have to keep it as an arms arms length and that's what was iran's policies throughout the course of the twentieth century nineteenth and twentieth century up to what we see now around us which is a very strange situation whether the balance has changed in terms of if this if russia is purchasing weapons from from iran which was unheard of it means that there is a new balance is emerging a new relationship is emerging perhaps remains to be seen but if you look at the historical precedence it would have been enormously unwise to be an ally of russia given its long history of aggression in iran see russians part of the reason why it's actually iran allied itself with british empire was the fact that it was so much afraid of the russian expansion and as such i don't know what's going to be the future of this relationship there is a big disconnect between governments and the people and i think ultimately i have faith that there's a love across the different cultures across the different religions amongst the people and the governments are the source of the division and the conflict and the wars and all the geopolitics that is in part grounded in the battle for resources and all that kind of stuff nevertheless this is the world we live in so you looked at the modern history of iran the past few centuries if you look into the future of this region now you kind of implied that historian has a bit of a cynical view of protests and things like this that are fueled at least in the minds of young people with hope if you were to just for a while have a bit of hope in your heart and your mind what is a hopeful future for the next ten twenty thirty years of iran i'm not cynical yes i'm trying to be realistic and i actually may be critical but i have great hopes in iran's future for a variety of reasons i actually did write an article only if the last version of it is going to go out today in which the title of it is the time of fear and women of hope which in a sense is this whole coverage about what this movement means that we see today we may fizzle in a few weeks time or it may just go on and create a new dynamics in iranian society that would hopefully result in a peaceful process of greater accommodation and the greater tolerance within the iranian society and with the outside world and i think majority of the iranian people don't want tension don't want confrontation don't want crisis they if forty years they have suffered from a regime that have dictated an ideology that it's regressive and impractical they want to go back to a life in which they don't they don't really create trouble for their neighbors or for the world and therefore i would see a better future for iran that's for one reason strategically or geopolitically maybe iran's advantage in a peaceful fashion to negotiate as it's the fate of all the nations rather than commit itself or sworn to a particular mhmm course of policy so there's a give and take as the nature of politics is art of possible as it been said so probably iran is going to be hopefully move in that direction i think there is a generational thing that's the third reason no matter how much the islamic republic tried to islamicize the iranian society in its own image of kind of radical ideological indoctrination it has failed it has failed up to what we see today in the iranian streets and the iranian population said no to it and i think if there would have been and i very much hope there will be a possibility for a more open environment more open space where they would be able to speak them their views out iranians are not on the side of moving in the extreme directions they are in the side of greater accommodation and the greater interest in the outside world and if you look at every aspect of today's beside the government every is aspect of life in today's iran we can see that from the way that people dress to the way that they try to live their lives to the way that they're educating themselves or educated in the institutions do you see a desire and intention to move forward and i'm optimistic well in that struggle for freedom like i told you offline one of my close childhood friends is iranian just a beautiful person his family is is a wonderful family and on a personal level it is one of the deeper windows into the iranian spirit and soul that i've gotten a chance to witness so i really appreciate it but in the recent times i've gotten to hear from a lot of people that are currently living in iran that are currently have that burning hope for the future of the country and so my love goes out to them in the struggle for freedom i it's so nice of you to say so and they very much hope so there are moments of despair and there are moments that's that you would think that there is no hope and but but then again something triggers and you see hundred thousand people in the streets of berlin that are hoping for a better future for iran and i very much hope it eventually emerges even i'm hoping at the same time there's not going to be a very strong leadership as it was the case in the past we started with hope we ended with hope this was a real honor this is an incredible conversation thank you for thank you for giving such a a deep and wide story of this great nation one of the great nations in history well that's kind of what you say so well think you're sitting down today this is amazing history that's as i've said in the start of my book i say is the history of a nation which has learned a huge amount from from the outside world by force of its geography it was always located somewhere that people would invade yeah or come for trade or something happened to it that is diffused culture continue to and they were not afraid of learning or adopting as they do right now today mhmm they this is a very different society never a boring moment in its history as you write about thank you so much this is all thank you
