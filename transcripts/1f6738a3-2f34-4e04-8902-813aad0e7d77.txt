and white going just when i went to walmart before this and got the wrangler shirt with the texas longhorns tee is that where you shop walmart generally yeah i'm a target man myself there's no way you get those suits from target so you're saying it's a it's a nice way to complement a suit i think you go men's warehouse if not further i think you would be wrong you go further no the other direction you got that from target not target i was joking about target i like walmart better it just felt like a funny thing to say no it was funny the most expensive thing i own is this watch and it was given given to me as a gift yeah when i was on tour i had these twenty seven hundred dollar cartier glasses that i got for a lot of money twenty seven hundred dollars like sunglasses yeah but they're really embarrassing mhmm but i was on tour so i just felt like i could do anything as far as fashion choices but looking looking back at pictures from myself in that era i'm my god so that was the symbol of of the fame got to your head i think so yeah i think fame getting to your head if you spend more than a hundred bucks on sunglasses you've officially gone off the table you've crossed the line totally and that's where you go back to walmart to humble yourself i really love walmart in fact i moved to austin because i was at walmart and a lady said that i look handsome in a suit and i was like that's it i love this place she just said it for no reason whatsoever this older lady just kinda looked at me and with this like genuine sweetness just said oh you look handsome she's she's not wrong man thank you that's part of your whole swag though yeah the suit thing yep anyway what was the first if you remember first recorded interview you did well like my first grade teacher missus claudia we this is back in the day like i was telling you we just asked her about her life in columbia and stuff like that but i didn't really get into actual journalism until my ninth grade year i had no idea i had an interest in it before then i wanted to be a rapper it's all about hip hop and meditation and picking psilocybin mushrooms in public parks and stuff like that that's what i was into that's a lot psilocybin meditation rap public parks yeah i was making like conscious rap music like i was to the point where i had like four dream catchers hanging above my bed alex gray painting on the wall tapestry on the ceiling just scribbling rhymes down all the time so you said somewhere that you sucked at school okay well let me let let's step back a little bit so i had this amazing journalism course in ninth grade i went to an alternative high school and and the teacher was named calvin shaw mhmm and he was just like he i i ended up taking his class all four years and he used to let me actually leave school like i didn't like going to school so he'd let me basically go around seattle and do different interviews with people as long as i could come back by the end of the day and write a story for his class he'd mark me as present so the first article that i wrote was about the the silk road and the deep web because you know yeah as a ninth grader when i discovered the hidden wiki i thought that i was like really tapping into like the the most secret society elite level black market in the world and so if you remember they had that hidden wiki link that was like hire a hitman mhmm you know and so i i messaged them and i was like alright you know i wanna get someone killed in my school like how much is it gonna cost me and i published my interview with the hidden wiki hitman it was probably a fad or something but who knows and that my first article was called like inside the deep web a conversation with a hitman that's nice yeah i mean you're fearless even then i mean i was hiding behind a a tor browser so there's not much fear to be had oh so it was anonymous it was anonymous but i did publish it under my name so you're right i could have been could have been in danger i also saw that you said you took too many shrooms when you were young and that led you to have hallucinogen persisting perception disorder hppd can you explain what this is well that condition is classified by persistent visual snow floaters morphing objects like i see them right now i see them all the time the the snow is in the room the snow is definitely in the room it's all over you and basically it wasn't that i took too many shrooms i think that it was i took i took about an eighth of semi essence mushrooms which are the ones that come from the earth instead of cow shit and i took an eighth of those at my friend toby's house and which is a normal amount but i was in eighth grade so i woke up the next morning with these extreme you know visual distortions and i thought that it would go away i tried to make it go away but there was there's really no cure for hppd it's a lifelong condition so it's just a matter of dealing with it and realizing that it is only visual so when people ask me hey i have hppd how do i cope with it i say remember that every other sense that you have what you can hear what you can taste you know your feet on the ground you're still on earth you're still here well you said it's only visual mhmm and yes gratitude for being alive at all yeah it's great but you said that this led you into some dark psychological places like depersonalization disorder yeah depersonalization is the feeling that you are not real but that reality still exists derealization is the idea that reality itself is an illusion created by your mind and that you're the only person alive and that everything that your brain is projecting to your visual cortex is a lie and that you're the only living human being both are pretty intense hppd creates both of those things and so when i've talked to people who have the condition it's really either or but more than seventy percent of people with hppd fall into either category they're both coping mechanisms for the like i don't know what really happens i talked to a researcher once named doctor abraham he lives in upstate new york he's the leading scientist when it comes to hppd research he's the only one who actually seems to care about finding a cure mhmm and the only known treatment right now is alcohol and benzodiazepines that's not good right so alcoholism something that came into my life pretty early alcohol abuse as a result of that experience because that helps with the visual symptoms makes some of the static go away man never tried benzos though so what so can you explain to me where in that spectrum you are like so do you sometimes have a sense that you're not real sometimes and something else is not real like the reality is not real yeah i experience it all the time you know but like i said my job helps with that because i get to feel like you know when you seek out extremes to a certain extent and you put yourself on the front lines of intense events whether it be politically or socially or just dive into deep fringe subcultures you get this feeling that you're real and being film is also confirmation if you can look at the m p four file that you're in fact living here on earth confirming yeah that you were in it with reality by watching yourself on video exactly so the is that basically the engine behind all the extreme interviews you've done well i got hppd around the same time that i began this journalism course in ninth grade so i sort of always used journalism as a therapeutic mechanism to deal with some of these symptoms especially depersonalization there's some pretty good illustrations of what it feels like kinda feels like you're trapped behind your eyes or that you're just this like nebulous soul that's trapped in a flesh suit that you're not really a part of you're sort of puppeteering a flesh and bone skin suit trapped or just the ability to step outside of yourself you feel like your soul is not something that is connected to your body it's something living in your head it's really hard to explain to people who haven't gone through derealization or depersonalization but if you go on support groups they always say like how do i break free from behind my eyes like dark stuff like that oh so you're trapped i mean there's a higher state of being through meditation that you can kinda step outside of yourself mhmm but this is not that unfortunately it was kind of the meditative path or you know the eastern path that i took and kind of fused that with psychedelic culture in seattle that took me down the psychedelic use rabbit hole in the first place so like i'd say it all started with siddhartha siddhartha is a good book have you done shroom since then no i don't really do psychedelic drugs but like a lot of people think that i'm against them which i'm not it just doesn't work for me if if it works for you i'm sure that can be really fun especially i know there's lots of like therapeutic uses for acid and ketamine and psilocybin but i personally abstain from those kinda anything psychotropic i try to stay away from drinking a bit well yeah i mean i didn't drink at all before i had the hppd stuff and i would have drank later in life but definitely like fourteen fifteen every day after school i drink a a forty ounce of mickey's it's like a it kinda looks like old english but the bottle's green and it has a hornet on the side of it just kinda became a ritual just to deal with the anxiety of of that situation and it made the the snow go away yeah alcohol really works to suppress hppd symptoms so you said you hated classes in school except that journalism class okay we need to clear this up because on my wikipedia page for some reason for andrew callahan early life it says andrew hated every single class except for one yeah so i've had a bunch of teachers who are super cool like this guy tim my astronomy professor cannon who taught me a class called new orleans mythology mhmm my three favorite classes besides my journalism class and they all hit they all hit me up and they're like hey man saw you said you hated every class except the sorry i couldn't be everything that you wanted me to be yeah and so i just wanna say shout out to all those teachers i didn't hate every class the point that i was making is that being forced into the institution of school so young and having to take common core classes like biology dissecting frogs history of the han dynasty stuff like that that i didn't want to learn but i had to learn multiple times i mean i learned about the dynastic cycle in ancient china three separate times at three different schools and i was like who is writing this curriculum and why is it so important that i understand this process yeah the part that makes school difficult especially in college is that you have people just go into school just to get the degree who don't really know exactly what they're interested in and they don't even have time to figure that out because they're in a business program or a communications program with no specific interest well i think if you wanna do school right take on every single subject that you're forced into it's like the david foster wallace mhmm just be unborable by it just really go in as if ancient chinese dynasties are the most interesting thing you could possibly learn and it is somewhat interesting the silk road and the the great wall and terracotta soldiers and stuff but i'm just saying like when i got to college i signed up for journalism school right and i didn't get to take a media class until the second semester and you know i i had to take everything prior to that and i'd already spent so much time i just think the excruciating boredom of schooling left a bad taste in my mouth but there was individual classes that i liked a lot yeah there should be some choice or maybe a lot of choice even at the level of high school for what what kind of classes you pursue yeah for sure and you're also saying so wikipedia is not always perfectly right no but it's just interesting because like i've said so much in in podcasts but that's what they isolated mhmm and i've gotten that question before which i understand it's the first thing on my wikipedia page but it makes me sound like a super hater have you ever seen this instagram page called depths of wicked of wikipedia it's great oh it's so good dude you said you love journalism what did you love about journalism i mean what hooked you on a basic level everybody wants media coverage right everyone likes to be on camera and get exposure for whatever they're doing and so being a journalist and being a almost like a a portal for exposure for people allows you to be on the front row of of everything that you want to to be a part of you get to be in the front row for history as as it's unfolding because everyone wants to be covered so being a journalist gives you a ticket to everywhere that you wanna go in life and so it allows you to step into different realities almost and then go back to yours and it just keeps life interesting buy the ticket take the ride hunter s thompson is he up there in the as one of the influences who are your influences i think the early daily show was so good sacha baron cohen huge influence i mean that was like the ali g show especially i think louis theroux's broadcast on bbc were great i was really into hunter s thompson too but not really until college you know i really like a a particular hunter s thompson book called the great shark hunt where he covers the reuben salazar murder by lapd or la sheriff's department in in in boyle heights in the in the seventies and his his relationship with his lawyer oscar acosta and that whole saga is great fear and loathing i like but not as much as his straightforward reporting because there's the gonzo side of hunter where he's like saying he's taking drugs and seeing shit and there's the other side of him which is like a actual reporter interested in in telling a story that's has news value so it's two different lanes for him there is something about you that makes people wanna say you're the hunter s thompson of this generation and i don't think they mean the drugs i think they mean some kind of nonstandard willingness to explore the extremes of humanity and like almost a celebration of the extremes of humanity yeah well it's a very kind comparison i'll get there one day maybe i just went to aspen on a little hunter s thompson recon trip to go check out the woody creek tavern which is the spot that he it was like his bar near his cabin and it was pretty cool to see unfortunately it's kind of turned into not not a dive bar now but it's a sit down sort of country restaurant but it was cool but i expected to see a bunch of gnarly hunter s thompson types what speed just doing drugs i mean drugs and alcohol is all part of it somehow yeah and so it opens a gateway to a deeper understanding of humanity but i will say though like as someone now who doesn't party like i did when i was younger it's not as important as i thought it was you know yeah i'm conflicted on this i'm good friends with a lot of people that say alcohol is really bad for you and i believe that too but there's something that i'm just as an introvert as a person who has a lot of anxiety for me alcohol has opened doors of like just opening myself up to the world more oh i'm actually a fan of of alcohol moderate drinking but i'm saying like my life before i would say twenty nineteen twenty eighteen especially there was the chaos on camera but then there was my private life which was like chaotic partying all the time oh i see and i i i convinced myself much like hunter did that that was the secret sauce that in the core the spirituals in my spiritual core yeah that gave me the creativity but then i cut out a lot of that stuff and i'm just as creative and it's interesting that a lot of i think one of the hardest parts about addiction is that if you're a functioning highly creative addict of any kind your your brain and your the addictive part of your brain convinces yourself that it's all part of cross purpose and that it has this like symbiotic you know in inspirational thing going on but it's not it's not true it can be but it's typically not yeah it's not a it's not a requirement right you can sometimes channel you can sometimes leverage all those things for your creativity but the creative engine it lives outside of that like have you read the hunter's daily routine in the year up to his death it was like fifteen grapefruits and eight ball of coke and like just like a certain amount of shotgun shells for him to fire into the sky every morning yeah there's no way and he didn't do anything creative in those in those final years yeah but so the creativity goes away and gradually you just become like a party animal like andy dick a caricature of yourself yeah i mean that's why life is interesting you make all kinds of choices and sometimes you can have create works of genius in a short amount of time based on drugs and no drugs einstein had that miracle year where he published several incredible papers in one year nineteen o five did he do drugs before that lots of coke and i was like i believed you for a sec but i'm like did einstein have blow up i don't think he did how do you think he gets that hair come on it's true i'm just asking questions high confidence hair look into it yeah you know what i mean yeah well no he's a well put together sexy young man the hair came later yeah was albert einstein attractive as a teenager no that's not teenager was he attractive as a young man sexually attractive or i don't i mean i'm turned on by einstein at all ages i don't discriminate but are you more turned on by the work that he did or his physical being no sometimes i fantasize what it would be like to be in the in the arms of einstein i could even get that out yeah in the arms of einstein yeah just just i wanna feel safe it's a good idea for a rom com to be a little more serious like general relativity that space time can be unified and curved by gravity is an incredibly wild and difficult idea to come up with like it's a really really difficult thing to imagine given how well newtonian classical mechanics physics works for predicting how stuff happens on earth to think like like like the that gravity can can morph space time mhmm both space and time is and it it permeates the entire universe it's a field mhmm it's a really wild idea to come up as one human on earth to intuit that is really really really difficult and it's really sad to me that he didn't get a nobel prize for that was it was there people saying he was crazy when he was around or was it was he universally recognized as like an og of this no i think once the papers came out he was widely recognized as the as as a as a true genius but before that he wasn't recognized he had a really difficult so back now where does a black hole go like after something gets sucked into it you mean is it a portal to another place that kind of thing yeah no well we don't we don't know it could be like it could be that the universe is kinda like swiss cheese full of black holes there's something called hawking radiation where the because of quantum mechanics the information leaks out of a black hole so it is possible to escape a black hole there's a lot of interesting questions there i hope we get to the bottom of that and there's a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy which doesn't seem to scare physicists but it terrifies me oh yeah for sure astronomy can be terrifying yeah we're all like orbiting i mean we're not just orbiting the sun but the sun is part of the solar system is part of the galaxy and it's all orbiting a gigantic black hole have you ever spoke to someone who's been to outer space jeff bezos he flew his own rocket wow that's pretty cool astronaut that's been to deep space now or maybe i've spoken to an alien that just hasn't admitted it i wanna do a a a research paper or like a report about space madness you know it's supposed to be this like torturous feeling that you get when you look away from earth and into the abyss after you've exited earth's orbit or whatever because there's there's one specific psychiatrist who knows how to deal with space madness and i wanna figure out how to interview people with it is this a real thing like is there a wikipedia article on it yes look up space madness treatment now i don't trust wikipedia after what you told me so i know they think i hate classes i thought you meant more about the fact that you're isolated out in the space that we need social connection and is difficult yeah i think it's just a feeling of extreme and insignificance that you might get sometimes when you look at the night sky but it's that times a thousand it's like an existential void that's created after looking into the abyss and then realizing how small earth is in the the grand scheme you just start to really have a a strange new perception about the the the pointlessness of existence i don't need to go to space for that i mean only a handful of people have been to space but i'm sure they're all pretty well off so this psychiatrist has to be like in the multimillions well technically we're all in space because earth is in space but so i wonder if you have to go to space to talk to the psychiatrist yeah probably so well technically we're all in space so he can't that's a boundary he can't have but not everyone believes that as you've seen from my my work probably you're right and that's those are important people that are asking important questions yeah you hitchhiked across us for seventy days when you were nineteen right tell the story of that well this sort of connects to what i was talking about with the boredom of school and these common core classes so after my first year of school where i lived in the dorms like a like a old school dormitory building at a school in new orleans called loyola university i wanted to i wanted to just do something i felt so bored i was working for the school newspaper for the for that whole first year it was called the maroon and i didn't have the ability to write my own stories like i had to defer to an older editor and they would give me stories to write about and they were all about like on campus happenings like the pope visits new orleans or glass recycling to be restored in the french quarter or hoverboards banned on campus due to safety concerns and it just kinda felt like alright well i kinda wanted to be a a gonzo reporter i'm not sure if working my way up to the traditional newsroom hierarchy is gonna get me to that point so i started reading a bunch of old hobo literature you know like post world war two vagabonding stuff and there was this book called vagabonding in america by an old hobo ed byrne and i read this and it just basically obviously some of it was outdated they had stuff in there like the hobo code like oh this moniker on the side of a fence means this person has free soup or something like that they didn't have stuff like that but what it did tell me great it told me about train stop towns like dunsmuir and you know places in montana where there was a friendly attitude toward drifters and that still persists from the sixties and seventies to this day even though in my opinion movies like texas chainsaw massacre have ruined hitchhiking culture in america because now everyone thinks we're gonna you know decapitate them if they pick you up so after my final day of courses at loyola i literally left all of my belongings inside my dorm and took the streetcar to the greyhound station got a one way ticket to baton rouge and i was like i'm gonna hitchhike across the whole country back to seattle with no money and that that was that was the plan and it worked out i love it i traveled across the united states before in similar kind of plan because you went you on the silver dog so it's a greyhound bus greyhound is pretty nice that's a step above hitchhiking oh yeah that's way better than hitchhiking hitchhiking greyhound amtrak airline amtrak no that's elitist what's in between greyhound and amtrak a car that's what it is yeah it's a car yeah a car a shitty car okay cool yeah i lived in a shitty car you lived in a car yeah when i was oh nice driving across from united states yeah solo with a friend some some solo mhmm and i would have i would eat cold soup i love cold soup yeah what i like is the cold chickpeas in a can you get the water out and just dump them in your mouth yeah those are good beef jerky kind bars kind bars are really good for the road yeah i mean all of that is great but too much of it is not great like too much cold soup not great too much beef jerky so what was the route you took was it chicago across or was it philadelphia across philadelphia across to la or where san diego is where we end up but it was a zig zagging went up to chicago and then all the way down to texas so you went philly through through appalachia up to the midwest yep did you cut over like through the southwest down to san diego no no no i went straight down to texas all the way down to the midwest so like but did you cut from texas west through new mexico and arizona to get to san diego that is the best road trip place mhmm interstate forty like albuquerque flagstaff vegas kingman the mojave desert yuma doesn't get better yeah i mean and your kids so you don't care and you were throwing caution to the wind i met some crazy crazy people it it gives me some sanity like whenever i'm feeling kinda out of control or you know like bummed out i just remembered that the road is still out there the open road never goes anywhere and it's kind of like a i see like an invisible door in the corner of the room all the time that makes me more comfortable because i'm like hey at the end of the day if i'm bummed out i can go hit the road and i'm sure there's gonna be a fun time ahead yeah get that greyhound ticket and go i would say silver dog half because sometimes i gotta ride the dog when i'm when no one will pick me up there's some places in the country where no one's gonna pick you up yeah kansas missouri they're not gonna do it maybe you're not charming enough he's all about that careful nineteen fresh clean shaven yeah i was pretty charming i'd say but the older you get the harder it is to hitchhike because they think you're like an escaped convict or some type of like psych psychowanderer and and some of these people are like what what we call punishers it's people who never stop talking and so they see someone hitchhiking and they're like yes i'm gonna talk at this person yeah and you can tell their their eyes are wide they're like what's up and you're like oh shit so it's six hours of just like oh cool nice yeah that's rough yeah yeah you're right you're right i like people that are comfortable in silence yeah and then that also raises the question are they about to kill me you know what i mean i think that's a you problem not a you know what's funny is almost everybody who picked me up when i was hitchhiking was like a like a day laborer like it was almost all mexican day laborers who picked me up oh interesting because i think that like in some places down there that's a typical thing to do hitchhike to work a lot of people don't have cars but they still have to get to their jobs so a lot of people ask me hey where should i drop you off where's your job at and i'm like my job is to explore and they were they were down with it it see like for me it was really easy because you just say like i'm traveling across the united states mhmm and i think people love that idea yeah and they wanna help mhmm they they romanticize it because they also have that invisible door mhmm everybody has that invisible door i just wanna go so you know what i'm talking about yeah i mean i don't anchor it can anchor you a bit just to remind you that every pattern that i've fallen into is voluntary and it's for my own stability and mental health well that's why i'm like renting everything and i'm making sure like tomorrow i could just go i gave away everything i own twice in my life just very like i'm ready to go tonight let's go what's the hardest item you've had to part with in in this experience there's nothing you've never had a material object that was really hard to let go of no so you give that watch to somebody if it meant no that's you're right you're right that's probably the only i've never had to let go of that though yeah that's the only thing i own this means a lot to me but everything else but then again listen because okay this watch is given to me by rogan who's become a close friend but like whenever i romanticize the notion that this watch means a lot to me he's like don't worry about it i'll just get you the same one again yeah i was like goddamn it it's a pretty sick sick ass gift though yeah it's pretty pretty sick i'm not usually a gift guy but you know when when somebody you you look up to kinda gives you a thing it's a nice little symbol of yeah of that relationship so it's nice but other than that no but even this like whatever the relationship is what matters the human is what matters not the i agree a hundred percent you had something like this not really i mean there was a hard drive that i lost that had all of my like childhood pictures on it and stuff like that that i think about all the time because i left it on a train and like the certain memories you think about it you just get pissed off and just think to myself someone has that somewhere mhmm i have dreams about reuniting with the hard drive you and hunter biden have the similar kind of thing i don't think he wants to reunite with that one okay dude it's crazy like you know all he did was smoke crack right or was there more stuff going on i think there's prostitutes involved oh okay whatever i think you gotta look into it i think i have to look into it too i don't know i was kerouac jack kerouac somebody that that was an inspiration at all in this road trip did you even know who that is the b generation follows who it was and then after i did the ultimately i wrote a book about my hitchhiking experience years later and everyone was like have you read on the road and then on the road i probably heard the title of that book every day at least ten times for two years and i'm sure kerouac is a great guy i mean i just don't i'm not too familiar with the beat generation it's a great book it's you read it or no i refuse to read it people even have gifted it to me and been like hey man you're gonna love this one and i'm like is that on the road if i honestly people have given me a book with wrapping paper on it and they're like this is right at the rally i was like that's fucking on the road isn't it and then they give you a different cover yeah no i'm like anything but that but i'm sure it's a great book it's just the comparison thing drives me crazy mhmm but respect big respect to kerak would never speak down on the whole anyone in beat generation what are some interesting moments you remember from that those seventy days man there was so much i mean getting mistaken for a gay prostitute on my first hitchhiking ride that in louisiana was pretty funny where did you come from and where did you go well i mean the the journey began in baton rouge and the first destination was houston which is about four and a half hours west on interstate ten so i'm in crowley louisiana i'm on the side of the road and i guess this was a cruising truck stop that was known for being a place where male lot lizards would go to procure clients and i was there lot lizards are it's a derogatory term in trucker culture for a prostitute who hangs out at the loves or pilot flying j large interstate truck stops now trucker culture as it once was is pretty much finished because of the livestream cameras they have inside of the trucks now so you can't snort sudafed or pick up anybody can't even pick up a hitchhiker or you get fired killed all the romance yeah definitely the the truck that the old school outlaw trucker lifestyle unless you're an owner operator with who's not even in a union which is like a real cowboy way to haul loads you can't do that you were mistaken for a lot lizard we were mistaken for a lot lizard by a small man from honduras with a spiky leather jacket covered in studs nice didn't speak any english but you know i thought he was just you know a nice guy and then he pulled over at a there's private theaters in the south where they have confessional booths set up and they have three channels and people go in there and you know he's born yeah mhmm people go in there and you know please themselves yeah uh-huh so he thought he was taking me to one of the to one of those i was like alright cool man yeah like you know if this guy wants to go jerk off i'm just gonna wait in the car it's all good i don't discriminate but then i was like he buys a booth for me and i'm like okay you know well let's i'm not really in the mood to watch porn with this random guy so he gets in the same booth as me and he starts jerking off right next to me and i'm like oh man like i don't think this is chill i'm like dude can you stop i was like he stopped jacking off and he's like what do you mean like i thought this is what you wanna do like i have money for you like what's up and i was like oh no i'm just a regular guy yeah he was super cool about it he started laughing he was like oh my bad man i thought you were you know selling something i said no and he said oh it's all good and he gave me a ride all the way to houston that's great yeah we talked about anything except that for the rest of the car ride it's great they just rolled with it oh sorry about that could it could have been i had about a foot and a half as well as the guys so i wasn't too scared i also had like a knife in my pocket but i i didn't wanna stab him especially not at a place like that and you were still that that didn't like leave a bad taste in your mouth well i i figured that can't happen again it can't keep happening so i was like alright if i got this out of the way the first ride the following rides are gonna be spectacular yeah i mean who among us have not been mistaken for a lot lizard it's a fact you're right here first what else what what there's some interesting beautiful people that you've met across the world app couch surfing to find places to stay remember couch surfing now you can only submit like five couch surfing requests a day unless you're a premium member which means you also host people couchsurfing is still around yeah yeah totally oh nice but it's evolved obviously into a different thing airbnb is a kinda competitor to that right couchsurfing is free though right so couchsurfing they call it like the cs community so basically there'd be these like couchsurfing super hosts in different cities like there was one in santa fe this firefighter dude who had like fifteen other couch surfers there chilling nice so i would do it everywhere a lot of them were catholics mhmm you know so it was their way of giving back a lot of them were nudists and so i didn't realize that there's a small little section at the bottom of someone's couch surfing profile that says clothing optional yes and that means if you go there i thought it meant like it's cool if you walk to the bathroom in your underwear no if you go there everyone's gonna be butt naked mhmm so i i made that mistake a few times not that i'm anti nudist but i didn't wanna you know i wasn't ready to take that leap of faith and yeah it was just great couchsurfing hosts were amazing yeah but that was just great it was this constant thing where i felt like wow people are so welcoming i'm not having to pay them a dollar for this experience yeah i love couch surfing yeah for like again for me being an introvert just crashing on a person's couch being essentially forced into a great conversation is great yeah the one thing that gets exhausting about hitchhiking is constantly thanking people you know being in like sort of constant superficial gratitude everywhere all the time like oh thanks for letting me sleep on your couch thanks for the food yeah part of the reason i wanted to live in an rv later in life is to avoid having to constantly live in this like thanks so much type of frequency because it's exhausting to constantly hey man thanks i think the shallowness of that interaction is exhausting not just the not not the thanks yeah it was a true favor of course i i love giving people gratitude for that but just this thing where everyone who picks you up is you know you get you get eight rides a day you're like thanking eight people a day like their you know the second coming of jesus you start to feel a little bit debased what'd you learn about people from that from that journey that's your first time really kinda going into it the the the american public is just so kind overall i mean they're so like embracing depending on who you are and specifically though the christian family people of the us who drive in minivans and have that that fish sticker on the back where it's like jesus fish and then they have the family sticker you know where each member of the family is a is act is a stick figure those people never picked me up and would flip me off with their whole family sometimes they would throw full doctor peppers at me as a family while i stood on the side of the road as a family together they'd they'd yell shit like go to hell hippie when i was on the side of the road and so it's weird that the most charitable christian american family values people never gave me any charity or even conversation they were antagonizing me and saw me as like a hippie left over from the sixties who needed to go to work go to vietnam i don't get it yeah but the people who really extended a hand to me is people on the margins yeah people working on seasonal visas people whose cars have you know less than a quarter tank left people struggling with addiction who saw me struggling or at least they thought that i was because they assumed i was hitchhiking not out of adventure but because i had no car and were willing to sacrifice their day almost sometimes to take me exactly where i needed to go that's beautiful man i've had similar kind of experience that people who are struggling the most are the ones who are willing to help you when you're struggling yeah there's there's people like in religious context and other kind of communities that just judge others because they've kind of constructed a value system where they're better than others because of that value system mhmm and that that actually has a cascade that forces you to actually be kind of a dick yeah i never thought about it that way it's so true do you think about like morality and religion a lot yeah yeah yeah i've been to certain parts of the world where religion is really a big part of life i'm just always skeptical about tribes of people that believe a thing and they believe they're better than others because they believe that thing that could be nations that could be religions yeah and i've i mean in ukraine and and russia i've seen a lot of hate towards the other yeah and that that hate i'm always very skeptical of because it could be used by powerful people to direct that hate just so the powerful people can maintain power and get money this kind of stuff it's a scary thing to see how easy it is for high up political people to mobilize the hate of just the average working person and can almost convince them to sabotage their own countrymen who they're they share more in common with than the politician they look up to just to advance the agenda of one party that's what we're seeing now are there some places in america that are better than others can you can you speak negatively of like aforementioned joe rogan talk shit about connecticut nonstop is there a can you pick a region in the united states you can talk shit about talk shit about oh for sure i mean well from that experience let's just narrow it down to that oh colorado oh jeez really yes i know so many people that love colorado dude dallas denver i used to think phoenix sucks but i love phoenix now the way they build these cities to just be so circular and massive it's just like stopping you don't like circles i like grids man oh you're a grid guy manhattan new orleans san francisco what is it about grids that bring out the worst in people circles is where everyone's just there's a everyone's just vibing out they're goosey goosey it's like the grid gets people locked in and hateful i don't know man but i've never heard anyone talk shit about colorado i have to say it's kinda refreshing yeah because it it provides a necessary balance for the colorado wikipedia page yeah oh oregon too i got problems with oregon oregon yeah well here's the issue you have and and i don't like just calling people racist because it's kind of like a two dimensional insult but you have the most racist state with the most psychotic anarchist city in the middle of it what is going on up there how did this happen the the yin and the yang is so extreme that there must be something in the in the willamina what do you have against anarchism i have nothing i used to be an anarchist when i was in eighth grade i had this friend named mads who was part of a group called seattle solidarity which is like an antifa precursor so i grew up like going to black bloc protests and i mean there was a particular shooting the murder of john williams who's a native american woodcarver in downtown seattle he got killed by a a seattle police officer named ian burke he john williams was carving a a pipe or from a woodblock with a pocket knife he's deaf in one ear officer pulls a gun on him and says put it down he doesn't hear him he shoots him six seconds later so that police involved shooting is what instantly turned me into like a very critical of law enforcement kind of person when i was super young and so as someone who used to see this guy who got murdered who's a fifty five year old man i used to see him around pike place where my mom lived it's a public market in downtown that to me put me into the anarchist political sphere be just just channeling the anger of that experience and the officer got no charges by the way you can look up the video it's horrific you know and it didn't get reported the officer i'm pretty sure is still active duty and so it's like situations like that early in life channeled me toward political extremism but i grew up to realize how incompatible that anarchistic worldview is with reality and with the with american society it can only exist in a small little chamber you know you can't apply that to the industrial heartland of the country and i think also anarchism so i've gotten to know michael malice who's written quite a bit about anarchism and it's also exists as a body of literature about different philosophical notions that kinda mhmm resist the state the ever expanding state in different kinds of ways and it's it's always nice to have extreme thought experiments mhmm to understand what kind of society you want to build but implementing it may not necessarily be a good idea yeah i mean emma goldman i'm a huge fan of her writing also the prison abolitionists that are associated with the anarchist movement angela davis ruth wilson gilmore all that stuff influential i still adhere to a lot of those principles when talking about stuff like radical prison reform and stuff like that but just i i drifted more toward having a more open mind as i got older extremism implemented in almost all of its forms is probably going to cause a lot of suffering yeah you worked as a doorman on the i could say legendary bourbon street in new orleans that's right where you saw what you described as this might be another wikipedia quote by the way but this is this is where i do my research does this wikipedia does it say hellish scenes hellish scenes in quotes wikipedia is damn right about that alright thank you that's a win that's one in the win column so yeah tell the story of that what's it like to work on bourbon street what kind of stuff did you see i mean i was a host at a at a fine dining restaurant that on the corner of bourbon and iberville so that's the first street if you go from canal street onto the quarter so this is like across from like a daiquiri spot it's the the middle of the tourist corridor of new orleans and the spot was kind of like an kind of a tourist trap it was called bourbon house the food was good chef eric i don't want you to see this and think you don't make good andouille sausages but it was overpriced and so i had to we had to maintain this like fine dining facade on a street where almost everyone is like throwing up fighting or is half naked so there was this policy we had these giant glass windows next to the the the tables so if you're eating at a at a bourbon house you can look out onto bourbon street and you can see as you're dining a full panoramic view of all these partiers throwing beads yeah boobs all that yeah we had this policy where if we're serving someone we can't look onto bourbon street if something crazy is happening so there's a fight or something like that we can't look right so there is a dude i remember i'm fucking serving a table there's a dude in a batman mask butt naked with twelve pairs of beads just jerking it yeah back to jerking it full on he's jerking it right and every every single person at the restaurant's looking out there like look they're taking pictures and the manager steven looks at me he's like keep your fucking eyes on the table so i'm serving these people you know and i'm like you want to eat what do you like red beans and rice or would you like some creole fucking and there's just this dude and you know ultimately the manager went out and you know escorted him further down bourbon street but you know i would get off work at around midnight every night and that was when bourbon street is at its most chaotic and so i lived in the french quarter as well so i live oh wow i lived about twelve blocks down bourbon on at a in a small creole cottage in a cute little like orange old school new orleans one story spot i lived in the attic above these these gay meth dealers named frankie and johnny oh wow and so i would get off work and i would basically have to walk through like this battlefield i mean it was a battlefield getting home was out of like the warriors movie it was almost the first humanity on display yeah it was like kensington philadelphia but just alcohol you know what i mean oh it's all alcohol but it's a lot of well a lot of visitors right from outside almost all visitors yeah and that that kind of would set the flow for the weekend for example if the raiders were playing the saints raider nation and they do not play around if it's the patriots that's a whole different crowd they think they're better than everybody else yeah well they technically are better than everybody else but yeah but people from massachusetts aren't like the cream of the crop in terms of like american superiority strong words yep no no offense but i mean no i that's i'm sure they won't take that as offense they are good at fighting though i'll tell you that that alright great new england has hands right compared to some places which places are those colorado colorado has no hands yeah the west coast not too much hands that's why you feel safe talking shit about colorado but if you get to the corn fed parts of east colorado i mean these guys got hands bigger than my head they'll feed the shit out of me but anyways i walk back to to my house on bourbon street and i would be sifting through this battlefield and i had a friend at the time who was like yo we should do a taxi cab confessions type spin off where we ask people to confess a deep dark secret and we post it the next day and so we we tried that and it went viral on instagram instantly it was mostly incest stories you know people admitting to incest i know it's a common southern stereotype but there's some truth to it there was some murder confessions that was pretty crazy we never really posted any of those but how did you get people to confess pretty easy and new orleans has a homicide solve rate of like twenty two percent so i mean most of the time they'll they'll just tell you i remember i was i was walking down bourbon and i asked this kid i was like what's your deepest darkest secret and he told me he's like i just smoked a dude in the magnolia to project housing the third ward project development and they said i just smoked a dude in the magnolia playground for touching my sister molesting his sister and i was like what and he's like yeah look it up and i was like alright hold on and it was like man found dead in central city playground like appeared to be homeless shot execution style so i told the kid i was like why'd you tell me that he's like man put that shit out there like i'm trying to go viral like tag me too oh wow i don't think you understand that even if you're a juvenile he was probably fifteen yeah you can go you can get juvenile life in louisiana for a homicide even if it's you know justified so i just deleted the footage in front of him i was like i'm gonna delete this footage see that trash button i'm hitting it right now don't tell anyone that again and he was like alright i appreciate it and he walked off but it's little little moments like that that i always anything for the gram i guess yeah after a while though it became sort of repetitive you know because there's only so many things that people can confess to that are that go viral you know and just oh so you were trying to see like what well i mean there's the incest one some people just say like i eat ass that was like every everyone said that or like i cheated on someone or i've seen a surprising number of people on your channel say mention eating ass yeah the way how how seriously you said that yeah will live in my head for the rest of my life that's good yeah i have i want you i want to live in your head saying that a lot of people mention eating ass yeah a lot of people do mention that yeah also that's kinda where i developed this magnetism for freestyle rapping you know everywhere i go people rap not sure why i mean as a former rapper myself in middle school and for the first year of high school i think that maybe like it takes one to know one but everywhere i go people start rapping if you and me went outside of this podcast studio and walked around for five minutes i could find somebody who's rapping i can tell who raps or who can rap who has eight bars in their head that they're ready to go i think you're also there's something about you that gives them creates the safe space yeah to perform their art yeah that was i mean the the quarter confession series was the first time you saw the suit that's when the suit came out yeah it was kinda like a ron burgundy eric andre inspired type of where'd you get that suit goodwill goodwill yeah always wow i was playing checkers you're playing chess good job i mean goodwill has a surprising amount of identical gray suits for sale yeah i've actually gotten suits at a thrift stores before they're great a lot of people donate suits and i was going for oversized suits which are the cheapest ones there so yeah it was like twelve bucks twelve to twenty five dollars every time for the outfit if i wanted to look super sophisticated like like i'm from another era mhmm that i would go to thrift store yeah because they're usually like this there's like a like the patterns they have it's just like a more sophisticated suit which is what you kinda picked out it made you look ridiculous but in the best kind of way the tough part about quarter confessions for me is that everybody that was featured for the most part would more or less regret being a part of the show yeah and that over time just gave me a bad feeling where i was like you know what i kinda feel like i am doing an ambush interview especially because i'm presenting as so agreeable yet the intention is to make something funny yeah and i get that that's what people do in the satire sphere i'm sure ali g and bruno and borat did the same thing and i don't think it's unethical because that's all for the purposes of comedy it is what it is but for me i wanted to do something different yeah because there's an intimacy to confessing a thing right and then you just don't really realize the implications of that and the atmosphere of bourbon street is like anything goes like it's a free spirited place but if you transport that energy digitally to a different place like colorado yeah they might look at it and be like different place and time like five years later right that same person as a family and stuff like this and all of a sudden they're talking about eating ass right exactly yeah kids have to think about that or you know imagine if there's a video of your grandma or grandpa out there when he was a kid talking about eating ass that's a horrible experience to to discover that about your you know respected elder later in life it's tough i don't even know where to go with that but is is the literally the opening question was tell me your deepest darkest secret yeah you just come up to somebody like that yeah how often do you get like a no how often what's the yes to no ratio well the weird thing is like we don't really extract answers from people like what makes a good interview is when they're ready to talk the more you have to talk and try to get an answer out of them yep it's it's just not a good vibe like so we kinda look for people who appear to be already ready to talk open body language like they seem confident and verbose and we approach them first there's a look we wouldn't approach a shy person and be like come on tell me no what about a person with pain in their eyes oh yeah we're interviewing them yeah so they're ready to talk they're just not like yeah there's different ways to be ready right i see homeless people a lot and they always look fascinating and the ones i've talked to are always fascinating yeah we just did a video at the vegas in the vegas tunnels like trying obviously it got taken down by fox but whatever we i was gonna make a joke that i didn't see it we tried to help a lot of them by getting them ids and when i made the documentary i had this idea that if i it's a big roadblock for them is getting identification without ids you can't check into a homeless shelter you can't do day labor you can't qualify for housing nothing so when when we interviewed them they'd basically tell us if i had my id i wouldn't be here and so we said okay we're gonna really help this time we're not just gonna talk to them about their struggles we're gonna actively go out and get them ids at the dmv so we did that and you know nothing really changed in their life and we sat down with a recovery specialist who works directly with them day in and day out and he explained to me that he's been trying to do the same thing i tried to do in a one week period for the past ten years and that they have deeper underlying traumas and pain that need to be dealt with far before they even take the steps to enter society as a housed person that's a heavy truth right there breaking that shame cycle has to come first because you you gotta think right like i'm from a generation that romanticizes vagrancy and homelessness to a certain extent if it's called van life or if it is done in a way that's sort of like rolling stone willie nelson hit the road people who are above fifty they feel really embarrassed to be in in the spiral of homelessness they feel like failures a lot of them have kids who they weren't there for that's not the kind of pain that can be dealt with by giving someone a tiny home yeah it's a good step forward but to to for someone to really make a change they have to want to change and so it's how do you help someone and guide themselves in the right direction and if you're too paternalistic and you use shame as a as a method to get them to clean up they're gonna end up right where they started yeah that's a tough truth to accept because a lot of people want a quick fix to things and i don't blame people who go out and give baloney sandwiches out to the homeless and each case is probably its own little puzzle each person is so complex now imagine drug abuse what that does to the brain yeah trauma childhood trauma there's so much to unpack and then just the the belief that they're the undesirables that they're that they they don't deserve to be a part of society because they failed a fundamental obligation like taking care of their kids if we could take a small tangent to you mentioned this vegas video which is fascinating it was taken down recently by youtube or youtube took it down based on yeah it was illegal fox five i guess so the documentary was an hour and forty five minutes we used ten seconds of a news clip that was publicly broadcast by fox five vegas and according to the copyright act of nineteen seventy six you're allowed to use any publicly broadcast news clip in a transformative capacity in any documentary film or research paper or broadcast or anything they specifically this corporation called grey media that controls the tv stations in almost every small town they had lawyers hit up youtube and youtube youtube complied with an illegal copyright strike to get our video immediately removed and i'm a youtube partner i'm in the youtube partner program so to think that i wasn't forewarned is it's a bit strange but it also smells like corruption to me to a certain extent yeah you shouldn't have that amount of power at the very least they should have the power to just like silence that five second clip maybe yeah but i i'm taking them to court because i i have the means to be able to do so i'm a larger creator i have an audience i have the financial backing to do it i can't imagine how many people out there or smaller creators with like not as much consumer of a you know a fan base they can mobilize against someone like fox five or the money to go to court so i want to take them all the way there to set precedent for future cases so that these giant mainstream media conglomerates can't copyright strike documentary filmmakers at at will it doesn't make sense oh thank you for doing that that's really really really important and that's really powerful and it might hopefully empower youtube to also put pressure on people to not and youtube is in a difficult position because there's so much content out there there's so many claims it's hard to investigate but youtube should be in a place where they push back against this kind of stuff yeah for as a first line of defense especially to protect small creators so what you're doing is really really important appreciate it man and it sucks that it was taken down are you do you have any hope well i talked to my youtube partner today and he said that the fox five lawyers have two weeks to comply with my counter appeal but you know i spent twenty grand on human voiceovers in five different languages so i invested probably in total like seventy k into this video so even if the it gets reinstated the steam's kinda been taken out of its trajectory but also it's just like a really important video is good for the world yeah like why why the hell would fox five have an a vested interest in having the video taken down i i just hate it when people do that to videos or to creators that are doing good in the world yeah it's not an expose on the mayor of las vegas it's an attempt to show the civilian public how to get involved in a local nonprofit and potentially intervene in the lives of the tunnel people well fuck fox five the other channel five as you said yeah well thank you for pushing back amen and highlighting it hopefully it gets brought back up but yeah defending other creators yeah so that other creators can take risks and and don't get taken down for stupid reasons yeah so court of confessions was written no it was all real life reality tv documentary but it caught the attention of a a a larger company called doing things media yes and they contacted me pretty much like a week after i graduated from college in the may of twenty nineteen and they said hey like how would you like to produce a a show i was like what do you mean they were like we'll get you an rv we'll pay you forty five k a year you get to we'll pay for gas for food for two hotels a week go out there make content and we'll be in the background just powering it all and that was the birth of all gas no brakes yes i mean all gas no brakes was named after a book that i wrote called all gas no brakes a hitchhiker's diary which chronicled the seventy day journey that we're just talking about it's a tough book to find by the way oh yeah there's only a few copies left i'm thinking about doing a reprint at some point down the line but i sold off the last a hundred copies like a month and a half ago mhmm yeah until then you guys should go read on the road by jack kerouac yeah read on the you should read it i don't know if you read it before can't get my book get on the road by jack kerouac it's great it's the best when's your birthday allison april twenty third okay i'm a taurus i'm a soon typical taurus yeah yeah i'm a typical taurus man i'm a scorpio moon just write that down what's the time when you were born eleven thirty eleven thirty at night or an of of course yeah typical this guy knew it that's the real science yeah anyways so the the idea of all gas no breaks as a show was to combine the the i guess road dog ethos of the all gas no breaks book with the presentation and editing style of quarter confessions so as to take quarter confessions on the road it was pretty much like a simulated hitchhiking experience but with the editing and like punchy effects of quarter confessions which is like i wear a suit we do the fast zoom ins little effects stuff like that it was man those were the the best years it was just so it was just so fun i mean imagine you're fresh out of college you were just a doorman interviewing people about like you know making out with their cousin and stuff and then boom this company that you've never even heard of is willing to buy you an rv and give you forty five k a year which to me at the time was more money than i could possibly imagine so i called my dad i was like dad i need you to find me an rv because he's the only guy i know who knows about cars and even he doesn't know much about cars so he's like alright i'm on it so the rv was twenty thousand mhmm and the first event that we were called to cover was the the burning man festival and that that was tough because burning man is not too keen on filming it's supposed to be a noncommercialized you know escape from the from reality i mean they have a gift economy set up it's based upon like mutual participation and non exploitation and so the idea of making a burning man video was tough at first because burn burners oftentimes and this is not all of them but are pretty well off in general a lot of them have tech jobs are pretty high up in silicon valley and burning man is where they go to take off you know to take the edge off and basically become their burner persona on the playa they become reborn and they take ketamine and they wear kaleidoscope glasses and steampunk hats and they you know snort mdma and they run around the sand listen to do you snort mdma that's one i need to go to mdma yeah i thought it's a pill i didn't know it's better to take it in a pill or water but you can snort mdma i definitely need to take mdma i'm already full of love but like that i'd probably don't snort it because it'll only last like ninety minutes let me write that down yeah so anyways we didn't know what to do because we tried to film don't snort the initial idea for all gas no brakes was to instead of asking people what's your deepest darkest secret it was what's the craziest trip you've been on so the idea was to not satirize drunk people but satirize people who are fried on acid oh and so we went to boulder real quick did a test interview with some lady who talked about seeing ancestral aliens during a peyote retreat and so it's pretty easy to extract trip reports from hippies and you know gutter punks and stuff like that or oogles so we go to burning man we start asking people like you know what's your craziest trip story and they didn't have the same type of free flowing storytelling style that like on the street trust punk in new orleans might have where they're like i don't give a fuck i'll tell you whatever these people were very bottled up about what they were willing to disclose so we went on burning man radio and we did a broadcast and we said hey we're we're we're doing we're psychedelic journalists it was me and my friend cl at the time i said we're psychedelic journalists we're parked on ten and i which is a cross street in black rock city and we said we have a nineteen ninety eight catalina coachmen sport it's an rv we've set up a podcast studio we're doing a show about psychedelic voyages yeah so lo and behold two hours later we had ten people lined up at the rv nice willing to talk so that vetted people in advance for us and so we did a couple interviews and that was that what what what were some of the stories from the trump reports there was this lady named rosma who said that she was known in several circles in berkeley for being multiorgasmic and could create multiple repeated climaxes using only her mind by like squinting her eyes and squeezing her eyes together so much that like the pleasure spiral just you know went crazy i i feel like i talked to several people like that at berkeley yeah you know what i'm talking about not that well yeah that lady i think she she manifests herself in many forms yeah right so but still it was on the cruder end there was one guy named kimbo slice was his partner name he talked about taking a shit after taking like a a quarter of mushrooms and how he was like seeing his childhood and visualizing his past life you know as the the turds were flowing into the toilet and just talks about the psychedelic union between pooing and taking taking shrimps and so he is very visual with his words yeah so there was stuff like that i interviewed alex gray which is super cool about his first trip in san francisco when he was in nineteen seventy one shortly after the summer of love i got to do some pretty cool interviews but still it was a semi ambush style i i i wouldn't say that we were doing journalism yet it was still comedic video work you know was there a narrative no that tied it together it's like really just a trip comedic almost with the interview and then i go burning man and then it's on to the next one so i guess that could give a loose structure but it's just like a punchy and slapstick thing everything was going good until we interviewed this guy named dj softbaby but he was wearing a golden leotard with once again kaleidoscope glasses shirt shirtless dancing like you know dancing and he was eating chowder out of a a plastic bowl and he was like this chowder's so fucking good he's like this is the best chowder i've ever had in my life and he starts putting the chowder on his face and he's like i want that chowder all over me yeah and so we we just go hey man can you just do a dance for us real quick just for some b roll he does a dance we posted on instagram the next morning doing things media ceo calls me reid he says all of our pages are down and he's like that guy you filmed dancing last night on drugs putting chowder on his face that guy is at the top of mit top of mit i don't understand he is when did say you know my brother's a rocket scientist he's like head of nasa or whatever well i mean the guy knows people in boston okay you know not in the whitey bulger sense but in the reverse sense i've i've trouble believing the dj softbaby oh dj softbaby was major it could've been harvard it could've been but it wasn't it wasn't umass i don't think there's anybody that's a quote at the head of mit who's putting what was it all over his face chowder chowder well then you haven't been to burning man yet okay i've not been to burning man so i would have to consult the my colleagues at mit if they know dj softbaby so whoever you probably was harvard let's put it on them okay the top of harvard so he made some calls you know to the to the tops to the heads of big tech and got all the doing things media pages taken down at the time that was like a vast network of pages and we ended up having to take the obviously the video came down and he held the entire network of instagram pages hostage and so that was he he made us agree to never post that video again and then somehow got all of our pages reinstated so that was my first brush with like you know powerful people on drugs and that was probably my last brush with powerful people on drugs so what what what did you transition into from there i think after burning man we went to the south went to talladega race weekend went to a donald trump junior book signing went to a juggalo adjacent fetish mansion in central florida called the sausage castle juggalo adjacent sauce okay can you can can you run that by me again it's a juggalo adjacent fetish mansion in central florida k fetish mansion in central florida juggalo adjacent i mean every single one of those words i feel like needs a book or something right so juggle by the way who are the juggalos is this oh i see i see fans icp fans okay k but i say adjacent because it's not a juggalo mansion but there's a lot of juggalos who kick it at the mansion it's juggalo friendly oh okay juggalo friendly yeah because they get made fun of in a lot of places oh so it's not okay got it and juggalos say outrageous shit you know and they embarrass themselves and they fight a lot so they're they're on the fbi's gang list which if you ask me rcp or the the the juggalos the juggalos if you who's the the head of the jug the juggalos it would be violent j and shaggy two dope but there's associated acts like twisted and there's a whole rabbit hole honestly tech nine is sort of a part of that tech nine i don't know who that is should i know who that is he's a he's actually one of the top selling touring rappers despite having sort of not that many streams tech nine is like it's got a huge cult following in missouri this is like the juggalos started in warren michigan we should also say icp in saint cloud posse so this is a thing this is a movement oh yeah if you if you went to seattle right now and punched a cop and they booked you in county jail mhmm you may end up running with the juggalos running with the juggalos they're of presence in pacific northwest prison system from what i've heard can you tell a juggalo from like a distance well they say whoop whoop so if you see a juggalo they'll say that also like i'll try to i'll try to look at that they're kinda it's called the dark carnival it's the mythology they abide by what do they define themselves what's the ideology a family a family no i understand but what's the ideology what's the the philosophical foundation of the they're anti racist they like to drink faygo and also just like cheap liquor and stuff like that they're they they're into drugs yeah in a lot of circles if you pull out a crack pipe people will be like i don't wanna drink with you anymore if you're at a juggalo party and someone's smoking twiz or something it's relatively accepted what's twiz meth meth right right lots of tattoos yeah the hatchet man is the most common one so it's a it's a psychopathic records logo it's a cartoon of a clown wielding a hatchet it's actually a pretty sick logo i vaguely remember enjoying some of the icp music it's good yeah it's pretty good it's funny it's edgy well they get satirized a lot but i got love for the clowns and also so when when all gas no brakes transitioned away from you know rich elite drug parties and into like the south is that's when the fun really started to happen living in your rv in alabama and florida and stuff is the best why why what's what is it about in alabama just so friendly down there and it's yeah yeah it's warm year round and people are nonjudgmental it's just great the south gets hated on a lot especially in the coastal coastal states mississippi and alabama are kinda like the butts of a lot of jokes and stuff but those are great states no i love it new mexico albuquerque all those oh yeah abqs it's great abq what's that albuquerque it's what jesse pinkman called it as the abq oh shit the the depth of references you bring to the table is intense it's okay i met a lady in albuquerque when i was traveling across the united states and she said take me with you said i'm sorry ma'am i can't yeah but i didn't think about that lady think you made the right call i don't know yeah on the road yeah by jack kerouac best book i've ever read in my life there's a there's a moment when he meets a nice girl on a bus and they have a love affair mhmm that's good on a bus or they it's good no no he they went to cali california well yeah and there was a love affair on the bus but it wasn't sexual it was just romantic it was it was in the air it was in the air which there is something in the air on the bus like a greyhound mega bus that type of situation there's some certainly something in the air there's a romance there is man when you travel because it's like strangers getting together and you're like feeling each other out and but you're in it like you each have a story because you wouldn't be taking a bus unless you had had a story so you're especially if you're traveling cross country or something you ever taken the dollar bus from philly to new york the chinatown bus yeah i have yeah that's a great bus the people on that it's not a fucking dollar though it it was a there there's some that are five bucks no no no no no no no if you book it way ahead of time which it's like twenty dollars i was like this is a fucking lie calling it one dollar i got on the i don't know why i'm swearing the anger came out i apologize swearing's okay sometimes when i got last time i was on the chinatown bus there was like a rooster walking down the the aisle actual rooster yeah watch chilling it was awesome well there's a nice part of your film with the rooster i forgot about that yeah that felt almost fake yeah did you plant the rooster no the rooster there's a place in ybor city in tampa where roosters walk around all the time and we had a rooster park there right by the main drag for what did i say we had a rooster parked we had the rv parked which is ybor city for a long time and the rooster laid eggs in the the undercarriage nice back to the all gas no brakes thing though yeah yeah yeah so it was lots it was really fun making it and then we started all gas no brakes in september of twenty nineteen six months later the country shuts down and everything just hits the fan i was actually here in austin when it shut down i was on sixth street i remember the i don't just hang out on sixth street all the time but i was just here do i'm not sure let's just be honest i do like sixth street yeah i like east austin better but i like sixth street too so anyways the nba shuts down everything's shutting down and i so i went down to the dirty six and i asked this doorman i was like are you guys ever gonna shut down he was like fuck no bro the dirty six never closes and i was like alright we'll see about that next day plywood and then i was like alright i thought my career was over when covid hit i was like what are we gonna do nothing's happening anymore there's no more parties or talladega races or burning mans to go to so i went back to seattle in the rv and i just spent four months just depressed living in the rv trying to figure out what would happen but all gas no brakes went on still for that this was the craziest thing about that period of time is that when when covid hit i'm sure you remember everything turned political yeah overnight in seattle if you went to a house party you can get canceled you know because people are like oh you're a super spreader so if you wanted to socialize even with a group of four or more you had to do so with your phones damn near turned off and a lot of people were doing hyper social policing at that time beyond that in the south and in more conservative places they were doing the opposite they were trying to prove that they could hang out five hundred deep with no mask to make a statement against the establishment yeah so you had this polarization that led to more division and that's when the anti vaxx protest started and i went to sacramento and the passion was unreal this is about a this is about two months after the covid lockdowns began and that was my first political video it was at the sacramento the california state capital in sacramento documenting the they called it the freedom rally but that's typically like anti vax stuff and it was real intensity and that video was my most successful to date at that time and so i was like okay am i a political reporter now do am i covering politics like what's going on what were the interviews that made up that video what what kind of what style of questions were you asking what i don't know if you remember but i was actually scared when the pandemic started i thought that this is something that might kill us all based upon what i was consuming and so i'd ask people what do you think about this lockdown and i've had people say you know i'm immune compromised if i get exposed to covid i have a ninety five percent fatality rate but guess what i'd rather be free and dead than alive living in fear and i was like wow so it's just stuff along those lines you had some san diego surfers there complaining about the beaches being shut down when such awesome waves were coming yeah it's interesting how that really brought out the the worst in people oh yeah i mean so sure why why that is fear maybe paranoia i don't know it really divided people like along the lines as you mentioned like triple mask yourself or fight for your country yeah right exactly like why is those the two options that is literally what it was yeah that's wild and both groups think they're fighting for the survival of something yeah and so that's where you really run into problems when you have two polarized groups who both think that their cause is for the common good mutual understanding is impossible at that juncture and so after three months of almost every everybody being locked down george floyd happens and i remember i saw the third precinct burning on my phone in minneapolis and everyone says andrew you have to go cover this and i'm somebody like i said you know police violence has been close to my heart since i was a kid and my first thought is i can't do that i'm a comedic reporter i can't go to minneapolis and cover this it'll be the end of my career and i had a friend named lacey who i went to college with and she told me she was like bro this is your chance for you to do something serious you can actually create a meaningful piece of reporting like you always wanted to before quarter confessions and you can turn all gas no brakes into a news source so i called reid who is the ceo of the company company that owned all gas no brakes and i was like look man i wanna go to minneapolis i was in orlando at the time i was actually at the sausage castle and he said he said sorry the sausage castle yeah the juggalo mansion oh right that's called the sausage castle so i'm watching right minneapolis unfold on lake street where it was burning and i got to the orlando airport and i booked a flight without cons i booked it on my own card i didn't consult my boss or anything and i was sitting in my seat on the flight and he he straight up told me he's like if you fuck this up and this destroys the brand we're getting a different host this if you mess this up and you turn our our our show away from a party show about drinking and drugs and all that stuff and you make this a social justice show you're done but i was like i just turned my phone off i got to the minneapolis airport on the second night of the riots and when i got to the airport there was national guardsmen in the airport and there was a it was like a call of duty mission and and the one in the airport and on the speaker they say if you're arriving here right now you are not permitted to go anywhere outside of the airport national guardsmen will escort you to your uber or to your car they're gonna take a picture of your id they're gonna figure out where you're going you are not permitted to go outside tonight and so lacey picks me up there's two people in the back two of her homegirls wearing like shiesty masks i'm like what are we doing what where are we going and she goes we're gonna go film the riot we're going to lake street and so i we drive down there kmart is burning target is burning everything is on fire she has the sony a seven she gives me a microphone and she's like go talk to that guy and that was a guy with a molotov cocktail in his hand who had just burned kmart down and so i go what should i ask him she goes what's on your mind so i walk up to him i'm like what's on your mind he said something like everything that was happening here was supposed to happen this is how we feel is it right no is this gonna benefit the community no but this is how we feel this is how we feel that's pretty powerful yeah that's i'll through a lot of the the documenting that you do this is how we feel is like yeah screaming through that yeah and i noticed that aside from a group called unicorn riot there was no one else actually interviewing the protesters the local news was on the bridge fifteen not fifteen but five blocks away you know filming just the the scene itself just the the fire but i saw some crazy things off camera too i saw so there was kind of two groups there there was like the the the anarchists more mobilized protesters and then there was just mostly african american community members who were just pissed who had nothing to do with the organized resistance and they were all kind of joining forces to riot and there's this anarchist kid who ran up to white castle with like a molotov cocktail and he was about he was about to throw it at white castle and this black dude ran up to him and grabbed his arm and he's like no we fucked with white castle and i was like what and so you see if you go on lake street every business is burned yeah white castle remains as i saw all these dudes rip this atm out of a bank and hit it with sledgehammers they were a group of friends hitting it with sledgehammers right they're hitting with sledgehammers boom all of a sudden money starts spraying out of the atm like i've never seen some shit like this like pouring out of it and then this group of friends who were just united and getting it open start fighting each other for the money as it's flying out of it and so there was just it was like a like joker from the batman's army type type vibes but i got shot in the ass by the national guard it was no good like a what a rubber bullet yeah yeah not not something feel like honestly it hurt yeah it hurt i'm not sure what i was expecting as an answer to that question yeah but i liked it it was good yeah and then after that i posted the video and it was very well received and that was the pivotal point where i realized that everything was gonna change i mean there was a still kind of a comedic element to the way you do conversations to the way you edit so did you see yourself as a potentially like a jon stewart type of character at first but you know i just think human beings are just funny in general yeah the absurdity of it cool thing about jon stewart is like i generally like to say that anybody who works for corporate media whether it be comedy central or anything owned by time warner fox msnbc they can't say what they want because in order to climb up in those organizations you have to appease the narrative of the company that you're working for to rise in the ranks jon stewart i feel like has so much clout in the media world that i'm pretty sure he can say whatever he wants like i actually don't think that jon stewart is controlled by anybody i really don't i think that he can go on the show and talk about whatever i do think that certain people have broken the brains of covid broke the brains of a lot of really great people i admire trump broke the brains of a lot of people i admire like to where trump trump derangement syndrome become became a thing like you can't see the world quite as clearly because of it and i think john stewart is quite a genius at like stepping away even though the world needed him in that time stepping away during that moment of trump and coming back now sort of being able to reflect being those sort of the elder statesmen my favorite jon stewart moment that illustrates that perfectly is whenever he went on the colbert show and he was just joking around with stephen colbert who i think is a full blown propagandist about the wuhan lab leak theory he was just goofing around he was like it's called the coronavirus lab and they had it before and now what do we have and it was like you could see in stephen colbert that he was like gun to his head type shit where he's like john john stop joking about that yeah and that made me realize like oh everything that john stewart did especially for the nine eleven first responders he's a true american and not in the sense of like the the the different political parties want you to believe as an american not a do your part and social distance american not a you know wave wave your trump flag in the back of your pickup truck american just a guy who genuinely stands up for what's right there is a degree to which you can be in those positions easily captured by groupthink though yeah even when you're not controlled by bosses and money and all that kinda of stuff and i think john stewart has been mostly resistant but it's it's hard his position is difficult i think he's done the best job though if someone in that obviously democrat connected yeah corporate media economy he seems to be the freest talker yeah so this is when you first became famous i'm not even sure what fame means i mean i just see myself as me when did you get the shades oh that was on tour that was that's a whole the shades that's a dark time but the i i didn't make like this is a meme really i don't even know if that's a symbol of fame whatever journalism to like become famous yeah i made it to give people a platform to share their stories it just so happens that people liked it enough to where i became sort of famous but you know if i could go back and not be the on camera guy and just platform the stories i would but the reality is people need a face to attach to stuff they like and so that's just how it is but yeah i would say right around minneapolis protest portland protest proud boys rally time when i was really in there is when i started to be acclaimed as more than just like a ambush meme lord did that have effect on you the fame not at that point not at that point so like you were still able to have a lightness to you well the country was basically closed yeah so it wasn't like there was a street to walk down where people were like there's that guy so getting famous famous during covid made it so when the country reopened it was as if like i'd my life really changed because i was like oh all these fans i made during covid are like seeing me out of the bar this is cool yeah at at first fame is the best thing ever because you can go anywhere in the country and these spaces that you normally feel a bit insecure in yeah like a local dive bar a cool restaurant a coffee shop where you just be another guy all of a sudden they're like oh my god i'm a big fan they give you like free stuff you get this sense of acceptance that you never would have gotten before so but there's also the dark side well it's all love man i i i i mean i just to speak to the first part you're saying it's just so much love that people have in their channel i'm sure you know what it's like yeah it's beautiful the only downside of fame really is that you can't really be anonymous again and you have to seek out more strange environments to be anonymous in like right now i live in the desert basically and i wanna live in the middle of nowhere in the mojave desert not because i'm scared of people but because i just wanna be like curious me again people don't know and i can ask questions to people that i'm interested in without them going i remember i see i see you here i see you there mhmm that's the that's the main thing that's what i loved about hitchhiking yeah just to have anonymity yeah it's true best but both are great complaining about fame is just the lamest shit yeah we should go to furry conventions that you covered we're we're an we're an outfit i love furries i should do that yeah we should we should go together i go all the time we should go together what's your favorite outfit to a furry convention no i have not i think you might like it more than you think i've listen maybe i'm just afraid to face who i really am yeah your fursona the true lex will come out when you're yeah in a thirty six hundred dollar everything is lost suit lizard is that what they go with well scalies are the lizard furries yep and there's a big division in the community where they think scalies are kinda douchebag you know because the the scalies suits are more expensive they're about seven grand whereas a first suit is thirty six hundred so and they're also taller yeah so when the scaly pull up to the fur fest it's like fuck the reptiles fuck the reptiles i can get behind that i like like more like i'm more like a teddy bear type of guy yeah i think bears i what's that that maybe squirrels i don't know oh squirrels are so cool giant squirrels yeah i wanna put a gopro on one and just see what the hell they do you were you were talking about that conversation with the guy at the head of doing things media how did that end up well i mean i wanna clear up a few things reid the ceo of doing things i actually think he's a good guy i think that he was just trying to run a business he saw what was working for his brand which is very college centric very festival centric and he was right to think that journalism and especially coverage of sensitive topics like covid or you know police brutality would definitely not work on merch you know you're not gonna sell a picture of me interviewing someone at a riot like you would me interviewing a furry or a drunk dude in alabama it doesn't work the same so the it was a lot a lot harder to monetize not just because of youtube censorship but also just because of the sensitive nature of the content so reid was looking out for himself as a businessman there was a different partner oh i'm i'm not gonna say his name that was more connected in hollywood i think he's responsible for the the collapse of the show what was the collapse like what was so reopen right as the country's reopening i get a dm from eric wareheim of tim and eric and i'm i'm covering something called the ufo mega conference in laflin nevada which is a beautiful river town and you know he he dms me and says let's make a show and i'm like oh shit is this real you know i grew up such a big fan of nathan for you and the eric andre show and those are produced by their company absolutely so i was like hell yeah let's do it three days later i get a call that says jonah hill wants to hop on board and i i can't believe this you know i'm still in the rv and i'm in laughlin nevada so i'm like jonah hill super bad are you shitting me right now yeah so i was excited and oh and moneyball jonah hill's a great actor oh he's great he's great all around yeah deserves the credit he deserves i mean he's got the credit by now but still deserves more so basically just within a week i assembled this super team of tim and eric and super bad team yeah pretty much of tim and eric i'm so sorry good enjoying hell mhmm and yeah we just pitched it around every single tv network rejected it i don't know why and they mainly did that because i was in this weird situation where i had signed a contract with doing things media that i didn't realize was called a three sixty deal that's what they use in like the rap world basically means that i can't do anything outside of them without them getting a hundred percent of the money so if i was to go work at sbarro or quiznos while i was working for all gas no brakes they would get my five hundred bucks a week from the sandwich spot mhmm i was unable to earn any outside income i didn't read the fine print because i was twenty one and like i told you forty five k a year rv sounds sick yeah and basically the tv networks were like why would we buy a show if the digital brand's gonna be running at the same time because they didn't wanna stop doing all gas no breaks to make a tv show they wanted all gas no breaks to continue as a web show while all gas no breaks as a future tv show at showtime or hulu or somewhere like like that was also concurrently running mhmm which is impossible for one man to do and so every tv network said okay we're not doing that we want an exclusive rights contract with this guy next oh yeah this is crazy to think about because it all happened so fast so jonah hill says a twenty four films wants to do a movie instead of a show and they're gonna let you keep the digital brand running so this meant that i could keep doing my instagram stuff with doing things media slash all gas no breaks while making an a twenty four movie with jonah hill and tim and eric so it was just like i was excited it sound sounded perfect so they said okay what do you wanna make a movie about and i told them okay here's what's gonna happen in twenty twenty in twenty twenty if trump wins there's gonna be riots across the country the major cities are gonna burn down if trump loses the militias and his loyal supporters are going to try to have a coup in dc that's what i said and i said so i'm gonna follow the lead up to whoever wins the election and i'm gonna document what happens after so they said okay and so i was to begin filming in late october you know during the campaign trail maybe mid october up until november and then in the following months to see what would happen this meant that i couldn't film anything for all gas no breaks the digital show because i had to dedicate a hundred percent of my time to making this perfect movie yes still one of the partners at doing things media was demanding that i not only produce the movie but also more content for the show and i told them there's only so many hours in a day man that's gonna be impossible and i said if you want it to be possible i can make it work but i wanna have half of the monetization from the show fifty percent profit split which i thought is fair if you want me to do double work when i was getting almost nothing before split me in on the profits mhmm they fired us immediately me and my two childhood friends who i hired to work on the show with me were all out of a job as we were filming for the now hbo project we got our fire notices the guts on those on that on that person to because you should be owning probably close to a hundred percent of it i think so too but they didn't see it that way because they figured we made the initial investment we discovered him is how they're they looked at it so it wasn't reed but it was the other partner who wasn't reid who said we have tons of verbatim he said this we have i have tons of connections in the comedy world we can replace andrew overnight mhmm i'm not sure why he made that miscalculation i wish he would have thought about it twice i wish it didn't have to end like that but it did why do people do that like what's the benefit of acting like that i think because you can part amicably without the drama i think all betrayal and anything like that is motivated by self interest whether that be economic success social stability whatever it is they figured that because i was being such a burden and asking for the profit that they could just release me and find someone equally talented and not split them in so they can make more money oh i see well that's a that's a stupid way to think people think like that man people who are the word i use is like sidekick syndrome like when people are kind of a part of the production but they're not integral they start thinking that the front man doesn't matter or something and that the brains of the operation are actually the people on the periphery and so they start to believe that they can just shift things around and the audience won't care not realizing that i was actually the one who created the show and that the lore of the show is connected to my rise outside of their jurisdiction if that makes sense like the people who watch all gas no brakes watched quarter confessions and read the book and so you know well this happens also not just financially but just with people that sort of part of a team but they don't really contribute creatively to the team and they they force their opinion or pressure yeah i mean whether it's comes from like from editors or all that kind of stuff or from sponsors or this there's pressure they create when they when the the creator alone should be celebrated and have all the power because they're the ones that are creating the thing in a way i have sympathy because i i can't relate to that because i've always been the front man of my own projects by design so i'm not sure what it's like to be like someone's owner from a content perspective i don't understand the challenges they face maybe there was something that i didn't understand i don't know true well oftentimes if you own a thing like this like this company you do think about brand right and then maybe you have a big picture idea what brand means and that that can be at tension with the the creative project right yeah like but ultimately freedom for the creators is the best kind of brand yeah i remember all three of us who worked on all gas no brakes got fired at the same time and we were in that we were in the rv that tim and eric's company bought for us which is a bigger rv in the parking lot parking lot of a walmart in south philly mhmm and the propane had just ran out and it was fifteen degrees outside so like the rv was getting really cold really fast and i just looked at my phone and it was like you're fired and i was just like god help me but i've had a couple moments like that and god does help me and they were always in the parking lot of wall walmart right well yeah although i know that walmart by the way the one in south philly is great yeah that's great but technically now you can't park an rv there well you're not you're not a man who follows the rules well if you know what i'm saying is those walmart cracker barrel and big five are supposed to technically all let rv campers park overnight but if there's like a crime problem in the city where they're at they can lobby individual walmarts can lobby with the corporate to take that away so like all the portland walmarts you can't sleep there anymore any city with like significant homelessness and like petty property crime the walmarts are a no go fascinating so that was a low point yeah and but from there from the ashes to phoenix rose over time yeah channel five was born channel five was born in the march of twenty twenty one after we finished filming for the hbo project oh really so you went all in on the hbo project at the yeah i mean we filmed the hbo project from november twenty twenty up until april twenty twenty one damn near we were just like you know picking up the pieces going back for individual interviews stuff like that so let let's go to that project it turned out to be a movie called this place rules it's supposed to be called america shits itself oh yeah maybe you can tell the story of the film you have what's his name i wrote this down joker gang and gum gang is that correct yeah the opening scene the opening scene of two characters just talking shit and then getting into a fight and that i i think was really brilliant how you presented that as a almost like a microcosm of like the division between the extremes of the left and the extremes of the right that's exactly what it was i'm glad you picked up on it yeah and then what i really liked is that the the joke again joker gang was kind of a little bit of a spoiler alert i i apologize but at the end of the film it was a it was a kind of voice of wisdom yeah i just i just realized he seems the most sane he was the voice of wisdom he like cut through it yeah i also just realized that a lot of people are gonna stream the movie after watching this podcast which is cool yeah where do they stream it on hbo max sorry yeah hbo max i never got a chance to promote the movie such a pain in the ass man i wish we could all just pay out it on youtube or something yeah and hbo gets the profits or whatever but like it's such a i had had to subscribe for recommend it extremely highly sign up to hbo whatever the hell on the positive note hbo is great to work with like that they're the most professional like respectful company i've ever worked with pretty much like yeah hbo has created some of the greatest like tv ever but even on in the background like they get shit done there's there's no there's no wait time they have some of the best heavy hitters on their team for trailers for posters all the promotional apparatus they have is like super solid did you get like good notes from people there like how to a little bit man but you know it's a it's a truly original like documentary like i meaning like i just haven't seen anything like it it's even like it's so like there's a humor and a lightness at the right kinds of moments mhmm like like i said there's a like a rooster in your that's like okay that's like a non sequitur like thing as part of a storytelling it kind of intensifies and reveals the absurdity of the division mhmm and how one once like january sixth happens like everybody like goes on to the next thing yeah it's like what happened to us it is it was almost like a delirium that everybody was participating in some weird mhmm just like well like people say mind virus like all of a sudden we just got captured yeah and people are just like yelling at each other doing the most ridiculous shit and i mean really january sixth the way you presented especially just reveals the circus of it all i i mean it really broke the the fourth wall or that's how i would describe it because if you were at january sixth and the lead up it felt like it was the beginning to a series of similar riots but it just popped off so much that that was it there you haven't seen anything like it since there was supposed to be a second one on january twentieth it was the actual inauguration that never happened it was a crazy time to be alive and around and especially the relationship that i developed with enrique tarrio who's the former chairman of the proud boys he's now facing you know twenty three years in prison it's like a trip because i went to his house in miami maybe two weeks after january sixth and talking to him it seemed like he didn't think anything was gonna happen he was just like yeah man that was crazy i'm i'm glad i wasn't there like they're they're dumb for doing that he even told me he doesn't think the election was stolen mhmm which is just a mind fuck it's like why were why'd you get everyone so hyped up it's just weird to think about how so many people's lives are drastically altered forever because of that just bizarre moment in time that will always live on yeah what what did you qanon as part of that story what'd you learn about qanon from that just an all encompassing world view that family that i talked to i call them the qanon family but it's called the spencer family mhmm you know they were nonpolitical up until the stop the steal movement began in september of twenty twenty and within four months their entire life revolved around the mythology and lore of q and i've never seen in my life a psyop just devour people's minds in such an intense way in such a rapid period of time and i love how the kids in the movie are also the voices of wisdom this is the spencer family it's the kid who like goes to the full journey yeah of like believing that whatever hillary clinton is a lizard or and just believing all the mhmm the worst versions of the conspiracy theories and then kinda waking up was like what was the point yeah it was heart heartbreaking to see his disappointment in his dad for even you know following qanon so militantly because he was like i felt like they let my dad down i felt like they let our family down you know because january sixth was supposed to be the day according to qanon that the storm happens and that the military is supposed to mobilize and arrest the members of the deep state clinton soros all that trump was supposed to go into a helicopter you know what i mean and take control of the country back from you know the swamp and it didn't happen in fact the next day he was like almost denouncing it now he doesn't but then he did and it was a really i think it hurt people's pride a lot my my friend four gs auto blow he's a trump rapper he he describes it that way he says a lot of people's pride got hurt by january sixth trump rapper oh yeah dude there honestly there's some pretty dope trump rap out there i'm serious they there's rap yeah like you would think like oh yeah maga there's no rappers there but there's rappers and they do a pretty good job they're good at delivering the messaging they want to deliver yeah i mean they think of stuff and i'm like that's clever oh they're like they have some political depth to them yeah well i mean is there something more you could say about like how qanon works like who's behind it what's what's your sense of who's behind the whole thing you know i don't want this to sound rude or anything i just don't care about qanon you know what i mean i've i've put so much thought into it and i just can't seem to care about it was it like almost a disappointment because like the to me it was like a thing that just captured a very large number of people's minds and then it just kinda faded i guess that's why it just seems like it's gone and the ideas of qanon have just bled into mainstream standard conservative thinking but there has to be a kind of retrospective like that's that's a problem i have with covid you know a lot of stuff happened everybody freaked out there's a lot of big drama around it now everyone's like okay forgot yeah just like moved that way what are the lessons learned has anyone learned any lessons yeah like what exactly and i what i'm saying is i don't want qanon adherence to see this and think i don't care about them yeah but like as far as who is behind it the damage is done yeah but what are the mechanisms that made it work i mean that's really have you kind of like thought about that i i kinda think that these viral ideas can be driven by and your film kinda shows this by just a handful of people and they're not malevolent they just want the clout yeah and there's something sexy there's something really sticky about conspiracy theories like in especially extreme ones you just kinda like it some of them can have this momentum they capture the minds of a lot of people and you just go with it yeah and it like when i hear some conspiracy theories like there's something like a small part of me that kinda like yeah it's decided it's possible you know that qanon is a psyop to distract people away from actually uncovering yeah what the deep state is and who is truly running things behind the scenes because the deep state is just the one percent it's that you take you get people so close to any type of class consciousness and then you totally divert everything into like lizard humans who live on the moon and that hillary clinton is eating babies on camera and qanon did just that that they want you to they wanna convince you that one there's no conservative deep state which is even more hilarious that trump isn't connected to a huge rich corporate apparatus of propagandists and two that the democratic establishment is the only deep state and that some middle middle of the road conservatives that there's no grifters or manipulators outside of of that three headed snake you know there's grifters everywhere everywhere everyone wants to make money dude this is the world that we're in it's in collapse everybody wants to make money and engagement is the rule of law so anything that's why these news organizations follow retention incentives they want to make money by selling ads so they try to create fear and constant division to enrich corporate media establishment and you have people who are almost realizing hey it seems like fox and cnn might be owned by the same people and are tactically using these machines to keep us divided perfectly fifty fifty to ensure that the power structure never gets disrupted and then you guys and then you get these people you know who's gonna save us donald trump that's the guy how is that the guy it's not the guy and i don't have tds i don't i'm not an orange man basher who thinks about the guy all the time but i don't think he's the guy you were shirtless lifting weights while whiskey or some alcohol was poured into your mouth by alex jones in this movie and then you did the same to him that's true mhmm this feels like an interrogation so alex was a was a part of this film he was like throughout throughout the narrative and he had he had a great interview with him what did you learn about interacting with alex alex jones from making this film for one is that he's the exact same off camera as he is on camera yeah it's not an act he told me that all real americans die before fifty eight he mentioned sean connery and a few others and how old is he getting up there yeah i think early fifties yeah i just found it fascinating i mean how how nice his studio is i mean the guy's got like an msnbc level setup mhmm i actually had a great time with him you know i mean it it's bizarre because having him in that movie created so many problems for me and when i interviewed him you know i didn't portray him in the best light you know we joked around a bit but it wasn't an alex jones hit piece necessarily but i like to think that i was a bit critical of him in the film especially the ways that he antagonized his supporters to storm the capitol or to follow that trajectory he told me when i met with him he was like i know you think that having me in this movie is a good idea but you're gonna have some serious backlash because of that at the time i was like man it's fine you know it's all good we're just hanging out drinking whiskey doing bench presses drinking jameson it's all good it was a first of all i had to campaign to get him in the film because the studios were like we don't there was a bizarre time around like i think it was twenty eighteen where deplatforming was the big thing that people were encouraging it said giving a platform to problematic ideologies will in turn expand their reach and so even extending your platform to someone who's problematic is helping them aka destroying humanity whatever it was so that was the whole thing and when i did this media training that was you know mandated by hbo it was all training in how to defend from that exact question mhmm they said when you when we put you on npr we put you on cnn they're gonna ask you about platforming problematic ideologies and you're gonna have to say stuff like sunlight is the best disinfectant i believe that extremism only goes away when you shine a light on it because leaving it in the dark will only allow it to grow they gave me like fifteen pointers i didn't use any of those pointers because i'm not the kind of person who wants to be media trained i like i like to speak freely but in the promotional run for the film you know when i went on cnn this was a crazy experience so i went on cnn and thankfully my friend was with me and so i'm on cnn and by the way your friend is chilling in sunglasses laying in the cogs right now that's larry's dude it's like the the it's a a mix of like the dude from the big lebowski and the brad pitt role in true romance yeah you know that reference no but i mean i'm sure it describes larry sue like brad jack kerouac okay yes yeah so so hbo had a press tour set up for me and the main ones were cnn and npr and so they said we're gonna you're gonna go on cnn on the don lemon morning show and he's gonna ask you about your life what led up to the movie what we can expect so i get in the studio it's about seven o'clock in the morning in new york at his show the night before at times square so i'm like groggy eyed whatever they put the lav on me boom i'm live on cnn sunday morning and he goes how would you describe enrique tarrio's mental state in the lead up to the capitol insurrection and i'm i'm looking around i'm like is this guy serious like am i am i sandwiched in the january six hit piece right now yeah i thought it was about me yeah and so i told him it's not about enrique tarrio it's about how companies like fox msnbc and even your station cnn use the twenty four hour news cycle to enrage people to generate ad revenue yeah and pit americans against each other during times like that and he said there's nothing fake about cnn and i said i didn't say you were fake news i'm not saying you're lying but you're directly antagonizing and and stirring people up against half the country because you need money during to support a dying platform you said that pretty much nice and great you know i was so my mom was watching and she was texting me she was like what are you doing and i was like i don't know and so he goes why'd you extend the platform to alex jones and i go i don't know i just wanted to drink some jameson and lift some weights with him you know i'm just at this point i don't support that kind of media i don't support cnn so you know i just i didn't give them much information about alex but it was very awkward they'd never posted this segment online when i got off of that interview i had a handler that a twenty four assigned to me so i had someone with me and she you could tell she was flustered like she was furious about what i just did and so she goes i just got an email from time warner c suite and i go what's time warner c suite she says i don't know if you know this but the same people who who own the same people who own cnn own hbo and it's time warner and so they canceled my press tour so my press tour was finished you know all the late night shows that i was supposed to go on i was supposed to go on like the late night shows and that was off the table because they were worried that i was like a loose cannon i think and then the only remaining appearance i had left was npr in boston and that was supposed to be a a premiere so it wasn't supposed to be an interrogation it wasn't supposed to be anything like that it's supposed to be a premiere in front of a live audience where they watch the film and i show up after for a q and a so i'm like alright whatever it's kinda weird they only have this one press opportunity left i kinda felt bad that i ruined the entire press tour by confronting don lemon but at this point i wanted to just do this final one especially because it was a a viewing and i was like cool i wanna i sat in the audience i watched people laugh to the film it was awesome so i go backstage and there's an npr journalist waiting for me and nothing against people who wear masks but she had two n ninety fives on and i'm not two n ninety fives is it's off is it's over the line so i go hey great to meet you she doesn't shake my hand yeah and i go why not and she goes you've been around some people who i don't want their germs yeah cool and i'm like okay okay this is weird i thought this is a sort of like fun premiere for my movie we sit down the first thing she asks me is how do you think the sandy hook families would feel about you platforming one of the most despicable americans in history alex jones mhmm in front of a live audience npr never published this the only recordings of it are by a fan named rob in boston who put it on youtube it's vertical phone footage and i literally am like well the sandy hook family's lawyer mark bankston who represented them in court in connecticut told me specifically that leonard posner the father of noah posner who died at sandy hook was a huge fan of the film and so i said that to her and that kind of just like silenced that conversation but the rest of the whole conversation was just about exploitation and why are you platforming mentally ill people and giving a platform to conspiracies like qanon don't you feel like you're a part of their spread some would call you a misinformation reporter all this crazy stuff and yeah next day hit the fan fuck all those people that film just in case you you don't get a chance to see it and you should you're critical of alex jones in a in the most artful way like it was the correct way to be critical it it showed him to be more interested in the grift of it yeah they and you didn't do it in a like a pointing fingers and like saying in the kind of npr way that you just mentioned it's but more like a human way like this is tragedies happen all over the world and there's grifters that roll in and then take advantage of it in interesting ways and then human beings get swept up on either side of it and it's revealing the humor the absurdity of it all and it was done masterfully it was done like for people who criticize you for platforming alex jones or whatever yeah the film from a political perspective is probably leans very much left yeah like heavily left but does it without that exhausting energy of like judging right just this kinda you know yeah two two masks kind of judging yeah and it it was just when all that was happening when i was under fire from the mainstream press for platforming alex jones i thought back to what he said to me and doesn't mean i agree with everything he says but he told me you're gonna be in trouble with these people if you put me in your in your video and you know it wasn't too bad of trouble but definitely i i do think sometimes what the film would have been like without him and i think that it was worth it because his scene is so funny to me and it brings me back to a different time in my life and i'm happy that that scene's out there i think it it was it was really well done it shows the the layering of it all the entertainment plus sort of not considering from his perspective the consequences of like rallying people up in this way that it's not just i mean you really highlight this in the interview like it's he keeps saying it's infowars but then there's always kind of a sense that infowars can turn to actual like civil war and yeah but maybe not maybe it's all just a circus like we play for each other if you look at the speech he did on january fifth it was said he said tomorrow you know millions of patriotic americans will take our country back yeah so he eggs people on and then when it gets hot he steps away yeah but like you said the thing he told you he turned out to be right oh yeah and the frogs are becoming gay they've always been gay well saying frogs are straight is even crazier i've read stories where you kiss one and it becomes a prince and yeah shit's true hundred percent do you think alex believes what he says in terms of the everything he says on infowars like how much of it is real he's right about like big tech censorship i mean i think if he's right about anything it'll probably be the heads of big tech colluding together across company lines to deplatform certain people he's right about that i think most of the things that he says follow the question everything narrative and everything is kind of like a conspiracy or like a plot or a false flag i think that he's built up a following for so long that wants him to do that you know so i think he'll question things that he probably thinks are relatively straightforward because that's the shtick of the show i mean the infowar is fighting misinformation and people want to see him be that guy to to so to a certain extent if you're a creator who supports your family you do follow economic incentives and people want you to be the character and so you're gonna naturally gravitate toward being it do you feel that pressure yourself i did years ago not anymore i feel like now i can speak freely and really say what i wanna say in my new life but when when i was younger yeah i felt like i had to be this sort of awkward sort of amicable aloof guy who just didn't think anything about anything and just was here to listen but now i feel more confident adding some narrative and voice over and things like that so for some people especially who publish on youtube the youtube algorithm they can become a slave to the youtube algorithm yeah i mean for sure because and i i definitely feel that sometimes i know what works for me but i i like to think that my audience appreciates when i try new things so i'm not totally enslaved to it i mean yeah i try not to pay attention to views or any of that well you you get some high views so i'll report that for you no i i so i wrote a chrome extension that hides all the views on any anything i created so you took it to that level yeah just because it's a drug man and i'm also a number guy meaning like you give me like if i do thirty push ups today tomorrow i'm gonna try to do thirty five just like enjoying yeah number go up like that's why i like video games like rpgs like where you're like improving your skill tree you're like getting an extra point and there's some aspect of youtube and other platforms anything any other platform you're like oh i got more today than i got yesterday that's really really dangerous to me because it can influence how much i enjoy a thing like if nobody gives a shit about it based on the numbers you're like oh maybe that wasn't such a great experience i thought it was a great experience but maybe it wasn't yeah honestly i i do actually feel that way sometimes like i'll put out something that i care about a lot but if the if it doesn't get as many views i'm like alright it must have not been as as good as my higher view videos or whatever yeah that's that's just like not true though yeah and it might mean like on youtube that your thumbnail sucks or something like this or whatever whatever the however the the algorithm works but i mean that's the thing i'm battling against to make sure i ignore all of that right it's actually something joe rogan has been extremely good at he gives zero shits yeah and i think it's it's easier to do when you're really successful well he was doing that when he wasn't successful really about anything he just follows like the stuff he enjoys doing and legitimately enjoys it he happens to be really good at it but he gets good because he's doing the things he really enjoys and like full on yeah passionate about and that's why he'll have like ridiculous guests and just yeah and just like just shit he enjoys doing yeah it's pretty cool maybe i'll one day try to do that for now i'm too attached to like the gratification of getting a million views in a day and stuff like that i'm i'm not gonna lie to you and say that i beat that or something like well it's a worthy enemy to be fighting because it's a drug and it's yeah one that should be resisted for a creator because i i feel like it can do negative stuff to your mind as a creator oh yeah for sure anybody that controls you mhmm is is not good a lot of people are controlled by their audience they don't have to have a puppet master on a corporate level audience incentive is a a different type of i don't wanna say slavery but yeah it is and that's why variety is good and you're doing that yeah always expanding well let me just zoom out on this you made a film yeah that's pretty cool yeah it was a great experience man i mean it was awesome working with tim and eric awesome working with jonah hill i feel the same about hbo and a twenty four everybody that i worked on the film with i have a lot of love for and i appreciate the experience it's my first movie it's a big deal like that's a good one in my head it's like i finally got to make the transition from youtuber to filmmaker and that was always this psychic barrier that i felt like i had to jump over you know there's a i mean just the way shot the humor that goes throughout it just the the narration that you're doing in like a shitty director's chair mhmm that's really well done whose idea was that it was actually tim and eric's idea there was a really great editor named clay who works for absolutely and they did all the editing pretty much in the office and so it was clay's idea to add a retrospective director's chair narrative arc to the whole film yeah just like starting with the absurd fight and then going like oh that that's a good way to start a movie just really really well done thanks man what about jonah hill like great guy he believed in this he did so was that what's that like what do you think is behind him believing in such a wild project i think that jonah hill has a good eye for like what's cool amongst the younger folks like he's in the skateboarding stuff that's why he did that film mid nineties and i think he probably saw a similar thing in what was going on with all gas no brakes and was like shit this this could be this could be big and so not only did he actually fund the film he also gave me his agent and and i forgot to mention that it was jonah hill's lawyers that he gave me for free that got me out of my contract eventually with doing things media or freed me up to speak about what happened so he was also part of you kinda gaining your freedom yeah in a weird way like even though him and i don't talk that much just because he's doing his own thing jonah hill is like a huge factor in my current success and just like everything that i've been able to accomplish just on your own politics is it fair to say that your politics leans left i'm not really sure sometimes you know i like to think that i am socially left like i think people should be able to dress and act like however they want i don't believe in restricting people's social freedoms economics wise it doesn't seem like leftist economic policy works very well on a city city funding level like if you see what's going on in california it seems like the the city leadership is mishandling the funds in california too so i don't know about that but i don't know i don't really see myself as left or right i just never have well if you just like objectively zoom out and don't have an insane standard of the extremes mhmm it feels like a lot of your work leans left i tend to lead toward lean toward like the empathetic perspective which i do think is more on the left and the right but also i'm not into like super like pc stuff you know i don't believe in limiting free speech either i don't believe that i believe in a free internet which i think is more embraced now by conservatives but it does seem that maybe you can correct me but i get the sense sometimes that the left attack their own very intensely it does happen but every community has terms of exile i mean look imagine think about what happens in the conservative realm you know like when black rifle coffee company like denounced kyle rittenhouse they lost a lot of money too like it's not the right attacks its own too i mean think about bud light and stuff like date terms of exile i mean you know like every community has terms of exile you just gotta know who you're engaging with and you gotta make that decision carefully it'd be nice if there's an actual write up of the things you're not allowed to say for each thing and then yeah i wonder whose list would be longer it just does feel like the last list right is a little longer if you're a conservative and you have a t shirt with like a demon on it like say goodbye yeah you know what i mean they're you know there's certain stuff that they freak the hell out about and conservatives are really concerned about pedophiles yeah i mean i don't like pedophiles either but i don't think about it all the time what's one of the things you do in the film is kinda confront one of the qanon folks where his concern is that everybody's a pedophile and you showed to him well calls himself a pedophile hunter and makes videos exposing democratic elite pedophile cabals and is himself a convicted child molester there's an old thing that people say that every confession every accusation is a is a confession to a certain extent so like it's it's bizarre that some people's whole life after a big mistake will revolve around trying to seem like the good guy instead of taking accountability for themselves yeah it's a common thing you see all the time like neighborhood watch people you know what i mean like what made you that you know like what did you do bro that you feel like you have to get karmic retribution by doing the reverse i don't i don't get it yeah do you think to the degree you have bias it affects your journalism no but i mean with the migrant situation i don't know what was that covering that like i just got a lot a lot of hate from conservatives for like letting the migrants tell their stories about their journey and stuff well what did you learn from just going to the border i mean just the sheer desperation that the the the citizens of the world are in i mean there's people who truly believe that america is the only hope for their success and to feed their family and i think a lot of them are kinda getting catfished meaning america has its problems too it has severe problems there's extreme poverty here but there in america like if you just compare it to other nations the level of corruption is much lower to where the opportunity for a person to succeed to rise is is higher i wish success on everybody who comes here but my thing is the expectation that they have and the sort of american dream propaganda they've been installed with isn't necessarily a reflection of contemporary american reality so i'm talking to people who speak no english and say i'm here for a better life i go where are you gonna go they say i have no idea and i'm like man that's tough and you you you almost think how bad are things elsewhere for someone to abandon their family make this journey across multiple continents and end up here with no plan and it just made me realize how sheltered i am to a certain extent as an american and going walking back what i said a little bit because i was just trying to make a point yeah but what what i think of as bad poverty like let's say west baltimore or ninth ward new orleans is nothing compared to what's going on in almost half of the world if not more and so it just made me zoom out a little bit sometimes you forget about third world poverty when you live here for so long and you get programmed to believe the worst things that are out there is like kensington philadelphia or tenderloin san francisco but those are just microcosms of more or less functioning cities despite what they might lead you to believe philadelphia is a great place so is san francisco but there's places where everywhere is really rundown yeah and like people focus on in major cities in the united states like homelessness somehow that's a sign of a fallen empire right but you know that that's a problem there's definitely it reveals some mismanagement of cities and governments in seattle and san francisco is for sure a result of the housing crisis mhmm especially post covid and all the gentrification that preceded it you know and it's unfortunate now to that the conservative media is saying like look at biden's america as if biden created homeless people and it it's just disappointing because once again you're seeing the media use real issues that should concern every us citizen and causing people to point fingers at a different political party as responsible for the suffering of others do you think january sixth can happen again no i don't think so so all the lessons were learned yeah for sure i mean people got really screwed over i mean don't you have a sense that there's a greater and greater growing questioning of the electoral process and all this kind of stuff i think that americans overall are very comfortable with our standard of living i think people like going to sonic and waiting in their car and getting milkshakes and people like going to the amc theaters and they like going ice skating and mini golfing and going to the bar after work i don't think that anyone wants a collapse of the basic structure of the country even the most politically divided don't want to see seven eleven go away we are so comfortable if you look at other countries even europe look at how they protest and look at the arab spring those guys were talking like january sixers and they actually took control of the government yeah you know and so think about even if the maga crowd took over the capitol building it's just a building i don't i don't know i just think that americans when when when they talk about civil war stuff it's just so we're so far from that even if the rhetoric is as divided as it was in twenty twenty it won't happen again for it to really happen it has to be there has to be a level of desperation there has to be a level of economic desperation that's causing people to starve or some basic resource going away water something like that who do you think wins trump or biden in the civil war well no in in a the guns in in a game of mario kart no in the election twenty twenty four oh man i have no idea man i don't even know if i'm gonna vote it's weird that this is our choice i know i wish people were more more focused on like city politics like i'd rather vote like yes or no for a bike lane in my neighborhood than i would for the president so local politics to you is where it is i think the feel it yeah oh i mean you can your vote actually matter you let's say you have a community of five hundred people and you live in henderson nevada you can influence whether or not there's a bike lane or if this is gonna be a playground or you know an ampm you get to choose and you can influence a hundred people to choose and boom this is your community you can't influence the result of an election still that those at the presidential level it sets the tone of the country and so trump running again and biden running again it just feels like there's going to be a lot of questioning of election results i just can't believe those are our guys yeah i mean what is that's really our guys like that's where we're at all these smart people we have in this country the great history we got joker gang versus gum gang mhmm where'd you find joker gang well is he a legit juggler or is he just no no no no joker gang is like a miami cuban guy oh is joker three zero five ross chico alive so me and i i have been following him for a long time on instagram because he used to like post videos of himself like popping percocets and smoking bloods on the toilet freestyling and so i had followed him for a while and then i finally got this platform and i said oh my god i bet you now that we have a million followers joker gang will sit down with us and lo and behold the clout did its thing and there i was face to face with the man there was a controversy a year ago where a woman came forward and said that you were pushy with her you respected and know you got the consent but you were pushy about it looking back can you tell the story of that what are the lessons you learned from it yeah i mean i've yet to speak on this for a lot of reasons mostly because it's just a it was a hard time and it's a sensitive subject and i've wanted to prioritize the reporting but i think that now i'm ready and able to do so everything sort of started on december thirtieth twenty twenty two and that was the release date of the hbo project like i told you we didn't know when the movie was gonna come out we weren't told that it was gonna come out on that date until early november and so i was like oh my god here we go we had a movie coming out hbo had i didn't even know it was gonna be them so every day for those fifty days to where i received word and to the movie announcement or to the movie release was like i was like a kid waiting for christmas morning you know what i mean it was like every day i just i saw the movie release date as the first day of like the rest of my life mhmm and so i remember the week of the movie release it was like every day i was like oh my god six days five days four days and when it became two days like i was so excited and so like honestly anxiety riddled because it was such a massive platform that i went out to the desert by myself out in the mojave got a hotel and just kinda sat there and then movie release day comes it was supposed to come out at eight pm pacific standard time i remember it was like twelve hours left ten hours left and then eight minutes before the movie at seven fifty two or i guess it was sent at ten fifty two east coast time i got a text message requesting a portion of my fat hbo check to contribute toward apparently years of therapy bills that this person had accrued after she says that she felt that i pressured her into giving consent years prior and i was confused not not only because of the timing but because this is someone that i hadn't seen in years or spoken to in years and i presumed that i was on good terms with so i didn't respond to the text message and then when i didn't respond about seven days later this person made some tiktok videos and with the help of some friends launched an online campaign that got picked up by the press pretty quickly so what did you feel like when you got that text well it's tough because on one hand i'm not opposed to restitution being part of a private accountability process for real abuse you know like if you've hurt someone to an extent that it took them out of work or something like i think they're entitled to some money but unfortunately as i later learned this person had legal counsel and this was an attempt to basically create evidence by extracting a confession from me to use as precedent for a civil lawsuit to the tune of a couple million dollars it's dark yeah how did you meet this person well i met them when i was twenty two and like i told you i was living in an rv making this show called all gas no brakes and i would travel between cities like every other day and so i would basically pick a new city and i got in this like pretty bad habit of what i would say is essentially treating instagram like a like a dating app you know i would go to a new place i'd post my location i'd surf the dms and i would look for like fans to meet up with it wasn't always girls it was just people to party with because i was also partying every night but a lot of times ended up being girls and stuff and so that's kinda how the situation was i didn't have sex with this person had a consensual encounter that they reached out to me about two weeks after saying hey i don't want you to take this the wrong way but looking back i felt a lot more pressure to agree than i realized in the moment i don't think this is any fault of yours i just think that you came on a bit too strong and i didn't want to let you down so i gave in and it was that language made me feel horrible mainly because if this person had told me hey i don't wanna hook up i would have said yeah of course not well i don't wanna hook up with someone who doesn't wanna hook up with me and i think that as fame increased during that time i think i was just kind of oblivious to how people were seeing me especially those who had a digital relationship with me prior to me knowing them and i don't think that i handled that the right way well thank you for taking accountability but just to clarify you got consent yeah i was the initiatory party in an interaction with a a fan who felt it she had to say yes because of i'm i'm not sure why i don't know why but like i said this person also disclosed to me they had a history of childhood trauma and were actively being treated for ptsd and that they felt things move too fast for them given their situation and so i i told her i said hey if you wanna reach out if you wanna talk on the phone i'm always here for you i'm sorry to hear that let me know if we can talk further about six months after that i was at sturgis bike week and i remember this day this was the hardest day i was just chilling and i got a text from my friend that said hey man you're getting canceled right now and i was like what do you mean like did someone find an old tweet or something what are you talking about and i opened my phone and there was this instagram story of me it was like the ugliest picture of me you can find it was like my face open it was like screenshotted and it said i remember this specifically because i just couldn't believe it it said the ugly loser who hosts all gas no brakes is a piece of shit he knowingly abused my friend and got away with it if you follow him i'm gonna message you and ask you why so this person who i don't know i didn't even know where who the accusation was coming from they text they emailed every production company that i was working with dm'd hundreds if not thousands of people like just saying that like i was this piece of shit and i didn't even know who this person was so i was frantically calling and texting like every person that i'd seen intimately for the past year and being like hey are we on good terms is everything okay and then i figured out that the person was coming from florida and i knew who it was and so thankfully i reached out to the original person who i had the communication with and i said hey like i think this might have been you this might have been your friend who posted this are we good like i'm i'm sorry i i apologize again i was like listen i feel bad that you feel this way i wanna do anything that i can to help you again i apologize and she said apology accepted i'm sorry my friend asked if i could if she could post on my behalf and i'm sorry i was going through a lot mentally and i saw your fame increasing so i agreed to let her speak on my behalf and we let we made amends in private you know i said okay i'm here for you let me know and she said apologies enough thank you for taking the time to speak with me and that was two years prior to this text message being sent to my phone eight minutes before the movie so naturally i wanted to go on my platforms and talk about what was happening but i but i also didn't wanna mess up the rollout of the movie you know and so the the pr firm was like we got this we'll handle this for you and that was i guess by way of a tmz thing that said andrew callahan is devastated i'm not sure why they thought that that was gonna make people be in my favor but yeah it was just a picture of me on nbc that said andrew callahan devastated by allegations that that was their plan i guess to show that i was remorseful or something you know how much of this do you think lawyers kinda pushing this when money and fame are involved well i wish i could say the lawyer but i i i just can't that was involved in this but i will tell you that i try to lean away from resentment and toward accountability completely what was my role in the situation how can i never make someone feel like that again what can i do what changes can i make to make sure that one i never treat someone this way and two to never be in that position again well again thank you for taking accountability and the main reason i talk about that is because it wasn't just that person there was multiple people who made videos reporting similar behavior and so it's obvious that that was a pattern of behavior of mine and so i made the apology video to announce that i was taking some time away because i just needed time away i mean my entire support system collapsed my friends at the time disappeared i was getting like obituaries texted to my phone that were like hey it's been nice knowing you it's it was great to see you grow good luck you know like i was dead and yeah it got dropped from my agency no one gave me tough love no one called me to ask me if i was alright it was just only everyone disappeared in a week again thank you for taking accountability but i just hate how many cowards there are out there like when people hit low points is when when you should help when you should stand with them if you know the their character yeah and it was just it was hard to separate like the initial situation that i knew was more or less a setup and the possibly genuine other accounts and so it was like alright you know what at this point in my life i wanna be on the right side of history i don't wanna be the anti cancel culture mouthpiece i don't have the the mental strength to fight this especially because i was envisioning the hbo drop to be this like the world opens up to me moment and it was just the reverse but the it wasn't so much the the media reporting on it that hurt me it was just little stuff like a a childhood friend that you love seeing they unfollowed you on instagram or just like seeing someone on the street that you grew up with and like waving at them and they don't they don't do anything back and and you're just like oh my god man like this is my new life but what are you supposed to do thankfully i like somehow two weeks after i met an amazing partner who i'm still with to this day and i was able to conquer my two biggest fears which is monogamy and dogs i was terrified of dogs and terrified of having a girlfriend now i have a girlfriend who i love and two dogs so what were the what was the lowest point well right after this happened i entered like recovery programs started with aa but then i found a more specialized program that dealt with the issues that i was dealing with say the hardest point was logically deducing that the lives of my loved ones would be better off if i was gone you know what i mean and thinking that my my my mom and my friends that their life would be better if i took myself out of the picture and for one i just figured you know their friend's canceled you know her son is a disgrace you know my my family's gonna think they raised me wrong and my friends i'm a social pariah now i'm a burden i'm better off dead and the hard part was you know i would read stories and books written by parents who lost their kids to suicide and they reported feeling a lot of anger after the suicide so i tried to think of what's the way i can do it to get the least amount of anger on behalf of the people who would grieve because hanging someone will discover you so i figured that drinking myself to death would be the way to do it and i wasn't able to yeah that was just a dark place you know i remember hating the people who loved me because i knew they would grieve and that made me mad that makes sense like i was ready to go i had no will to live but their grief was like i didn't wanna cause that because i don't wanna hurt them so i was like i hated the people who loved me because they were stopping me from taking my own life you know and it's weird to think that like when i was going through that if you walk by me in the street i look like a normal guy and so now when i walk around and i see people i think to myself you have no idea what that person is going through you know like it's crazy that so many people are suffering in like complete silence and you can't they don't wear it on them you know many of the people you talk to are probably that yeah many of the people you've interviewed before all this and after are probably going through some shit i also thought if if i could write down what i just told you on a piece of paper and i was to to do it and then they found the note they would take it more seriously because they would know that i wasn't lying yeah but then you know if you do it it reduces the lifespan of your parents by fifteen years so i looked at it like i was taking time away from them well thank you for the most part leaning towards accountability it's the right path to take what advice would you give to young men that look up to you on how they can be good men especially in regard to women if you have any kind of platform you know whether it doesn't have to be famous on instagram it could be like if you're a pillar of your community in the culinary world or whatever it is just be hyperaware of that and remember that you are inheriting a power dynamic that can create situations where there might be some pressure that you you don't even realize is there but it's definitely there and you just have to be aware of that and two when when meeting new partners having hookups and stuff like that just try to have a trauma informed conversation about their past really know the experiences and the backstory of what a new partner has gone through in that world of intimacy whatever they're comfortable you know to share obviously but you know i would advise against one night stands i would advise against hooking up with someone that you're meeting for the first time have those conversations prior because even though it might sound like a vibe killer it's not and if you think that that conversation is a vibe killer you probably shouldn't be in that situation in the first place especially now how hypersexualized things are and how common that type of violence is you need to be able to have those conversations and stop and say hey tell me a little bit about your past is there any triggers that make you uncomfortable let me know how i can be the best partner to you and i'm sure that college age people are not having those conversations but i'm sure that it would go a long way so especially when you're young college aged you don't have enough experience to be able to read a person without having that conversation because a lot of times you can see the trauma without explicitly talking about it but that takes experience and knowledge and seeing the world when you're young and you don't know you really don't know shit making things a bit more explicit is probably better yeah and also like as men we're trained to believe that it's our duty to be the initiatory party in any type of like sexual encounter like oh like man chases woman you know what i mean like you know you have to be the one to make the move and or like she's playing hard to get if you know she's resistant to your first like compliment or something i think that that's not always how it has to be and that extra caution needs to be placed if you're taking the initiatory role on an interaction especially if someone has a traumatic background they might agree to do something with you because they're scared and you might not realize that's what's going on but because you don't you don't see yourself as a predatory person you don't see yourself as someone who would ever consciously make someone uncomfortable or cross a boundary but people have histories that you might not understand and for me as someone who doesn't have much honestly like childhood trauma or anything like that it's been an interesting year for me working in therapy and elsewhere understanding how that affects the mind and also i understand that hurt people hurt people and that someone with a traumatic background isn't going to have sympathy for applying that traumatic pain to someone else even if that person isn't the cause of of of what put them in that spot if we can go back to channel five can you tell the origin story of that yeah i mean channel five we during the all gas no breaks days we used to tell people that we were called channel five if we wanted them to stop antagonizing us while we were filming because every town has a channel five so when people were like what's this for if they're being super rude and like trying to get in the camera and be hella obnoxious we would just say oh we're channel five and they would be like oh my grandma's gonna see that and they would leave us alone so channel five was a diversion tactic during all gas no breaks and it just so happened that we were in miami beach one time and this kid came up like drinking liquor like you know trying to yell about like whatever the whatever they yell about in miami beach like titties or whatever and we're like bro this is channel five be careful what you say and he was like for real and he just walked off and i said to my friend at the time i was like that sounded pretty good right channel five and he goes that sound pretty good he's like that's gotta be trademarked though no it's not trademarked yeah it's crazy right there's a channel five in every city channel five ktla channel five seattle como news dude channel five itself we own it because because no one's thought of something that simple because you'd think you'd have to specify we own channel five dot com channel five dot news dude we own it it's it's awesome so it was the same kind of spirit as as the previous thing but yeah what was the first one you did on under the channel five flag miami beach spring break i think i've seen that and it's gonna be a callback i think i think the i think somebody mentioning eating ass there too that would be the place i believe that was there's only about five places in the us where people yell about eating ass all the time mhmm bourbon street yeah south beach miami sixth street in austin broadway in nashville and i'm just gonna go ahead and say times square you might not think it but times square really yeah you'll have a bad ass there times square i would say beale street in memphis but it's not it's not good oh yeah i mean beale street is like the the median age is too high on bill street for anyone to yell about ass oh this is a fascinating portrait of america through that specific lens so miami beach yeah and then how would you describe your style of interviewing just now that you've collected so many if you if you had a style how would you describe yourself i guess before especially it used to be like deadpan now i would describe it as more directed but still relatively affable agreeable deadpan interview style yeah there's a like in the face of absurdity yeah you're just like there with a microphone there there's a there's a comic aspect to it mhmm and that's intentional yeah i used to look at the camera like jim from the office back in the day yeah i don't do that anymore what about the editing like how do you think about the editing i still do most of it but susan helps a lot too it's my associate yeah the editing style like i said we pioneered this editing style that honestly was inspired a bit by like vic berger but we took it to real life crash zooms kind of chopping up vocals a bit to add comedic timing where it didn't necessarily exist like you might add two seconds of awkward silence that are built with room tone or you might make everything really fast by cutting silence and switching frames i mean switching camera angles but now we try to be pretty straightforward because we wanna be taken more seriously you know yeah sure what's crash zoom by the way a crash zoom is when the like it's artificial zoom that you might add in adobe premiere where the camera zooms in on someone's face where the resolution is not there the resolution is not there unless you have a like a blackmagic cinema camera which you don't we don't we don't use those the file size is too big the file that's the only constraint okay alright percent and you also do voice over storytelling i think the first time i really did that was in the san francisco streets video because there's so much content about san francisco homelessness tenderloin shoplifting but there's not that much context in those videos about the history of san francisco the housing crisis nimbyism random zoning stuff that sounds boring but has a major role in the current situation on the streets there as to why the tenderloin is neglected by police and by the city council and the other neighborhoods like nob hill and north beach are so nice so i added that purposely to the san francisco video and then also to the philadelphia streets video to accentuate the reporting and add some historical analysis what's your goal with some of these videos like the philadelphia streets one is it to reveal the full spectrum of humanity or is it also to tell a story that's almost political what state is number one is always humanization that's the primary goal is to take people in circumstances where they're often news items and remind the public that these are people with lives and concerns and dreams just like you but secondly we also wanna start introducing more solution oriented journalism so not just oh my god i'm becoming aware of how horrible this is but what can you actually do to help and as you could see with the vegas tunnels video people are responding pretty positively to it like here's how you can maybe help a homeless neighbor help get them an id help them qualify for housing or get a job at the scrapyard there's always ways to help but so much of the youtube world is oversaturated by just like endless videos of people suffering and the comments are always like wow so horrible but what does that really do for somebody you've interviewed many rappers yes educate me there's a lot to it yeah can you explain this drill rap situation what what is drill rap evolving situation drill began in two thousand ten some people say it was chief keef in chicago i think it was king louie in chicago but i think all of it was very influenced by waka flocka flame who dropped an album called flockaveli in two thousand ten it was like hyper violent adrenaline boosting rap music made by people who are actually in the streets so in the nineties you like if you had fifty cent you had rappers rapping about like whatever gangster shit selling crack and beating people up but they weren't actually doing it drill has a true crime component to where drill fans want to know that the person rapping about catching bodies does in fact kill people so drill is it's pretty horrifying it sounds great but it started in chicago then it spread to england and now it's bounced back to new york it's just like the bronx and brooklyn specifically and spread from new york to the rest of the country so now there's probably a drill wrapper every ten square miles so these are as opposed to pretending to be a gangster and killing people you you get some credibility by actually doing it yes and the fans are typically not in the communities that are affected by poverty so they're kinda like superheroes to white kids it's dark and not just white kids but just anyone who's not in the hood it's not necessarily a race thing there's white drill rappers too slim jesus was was a big one he's out of the picture now but there's there's white drill rappers slim jesus you made a video on o block yeah what is what is o block the place the culture the people you o block is a housing project in south chicago in the englewood area where michelle obama grew up it's also where chief keef was born and raised i don't know if he was born there but he was raised there and he is the the forefather of modern drill music as we know it so these are the projects where drill began it's also the first place where you had that intersection of drill music and true crime because o'block has a lot of rappers and then nearby is an area called saint lawrence aka tucaville which has a lot of rappers as well and so these two rival drill gangs basically have you know a lot of history and it connects to music at large so you've interviewed people there mhmm was there any concern for your safety no i mean i think that o block is has calmed down a lot for one it has security so you can't even really get in and out but two i think that o'block's trying to rebrand itself a lot because it could be because lil durk's avoiding a reco charge could be for a variety of reasons i know you don't know exactly what that means but lil durk or rapper lil durk is from affiliated with o block yep and a lot of people have been murdered in retribution for killings that lil durk may or may not have influenced the ordering of but anyways and lil durk documented the killings in in the no via rap music probably okay i know you don't know about drill and but lil durk was associated with a rapper named king von uh-huh and king von perhaps paid for the assassination of a rapper named fbg duck who got killed in chicago's gold coast neighborhood it's possible the o block six are drill associated not rappers but just shooters and they perhaps operate on king von's behalf went and killed fbg duck king von was lil durk's artist king von's now dead so there's a definitely a concern that some of the fed charges will fall on dirt not sure if that's true but it's rumors in the hip hop community so o'block right now and when i film the video it's trying to go through a major image rehab if you go on any instagram of anyone in o'block they've all converted to islam and so they post pictures of themselves praying in the morning and have captions like put the guns down let's pray so i think when i went there they saw it as a good opportunity to do a positive rebrand and so i interviewed a rapper named boss top who was there all the way back in twenty eleven when chief keef was coming up and so he basically ensured my safe protection but he didn't even need to they're all very friendly and they know exactly what's up with youtube stuff i like how twenty eleven is the old days like the ancient oh yeah the found the founding fathers i was in eighth grade oh man time flies when you're having fun it sure does little dirk where's little dirk now atlanta so you left chicago not safe yeah i mean every rapper has to leave their hometown it's what i did it's a journey seattle would have taken me out bro how's your i mean you do interview a lot of people i mean that's like a top comment but it speaks to the reality of the fact that you always find somebody rapping or you yeah you create the space for people to rap what's that about i don't know man it's but they're usually really good you think so i appreciate it well hell yeah man i mean rappers in their own way since i touched the microphone rappers have gravitated toward me mhmm i think there's something happening a rapper whisperer i think there's something happening on a deeper cosmic spiritual level yeah that lets the mind of rappers know that like they have a safe place in front of our camera crew you have an interview with cook mac i do who's cook mac he's at jail right now oh he is yeah is that a hashtag yeah for sure what that's an intense interview people should go watch it people should go watch your all your interviews but that one is pretty intense thanks i was a little afraid for your life oh crit max is the safest guy in in the world he's a sweetheart oh definitely dude yeah both of them i feel like more safe around crit mack than i do on any given pedestrian yeah he was loud and flavorful yeah i should say so who is he what's his story well his name's trevor he grew up in ontario california in the inland empire moved to texas with his mom after his dad left his mom started started dating a cop from houston named mister gary his mom found mister gary getting you know anally penetrated by a coworker and so she booked crip mac a one way greyhound ticket to la where he joined the crips that's a good story you know that's true oh you jumped right to mister gary yeah yeah yeah of course yeah i'm just saying that you know he's a classic case if somebody without a father figure who found camaraderie and you know sense of belonging and purpose in a street gang which in la is like a rule of law in most of the city we were i forget in what context earlier talking about martial arts and fighting and he's got it working as punching form i yeah i think so he he gets into a lot of fights in jail though and from what i've heard he wins like he does a lot about half of them so it's good alright what do you go to jail for now firearm possession it was a probation violation oh it's too bad alright what's so philly you went to the border mhmm occupied seattle protests you went to ukraine yeah what are some interesting things that stand out to you from memory just as i asked the question some interesting i mean i was in jail at the border for a while that was horrible what was that like was that your first time yeah well you know i didn't know that i couldn't hop my own border as an american i'm thinking this is my country i can get in any way that i want wrong you can only enter the us through an official port of entry which i learned the hard way because i got arrested by border patrol and held as a detainee at a migrant center for a few days what was the that like horrible which aspect i mean well for one like i don't know it was just to be in a place like that and i probably sound like such a wimp right now because i know someone's watching this who's done some hard time but we thought we were gonna do at least six months in jail because the the guards freaked us out and we're like you're being charged with a federal crime you know what you boys did is serious we're waiting on word from san antonio about whether or not we're gonna extradite you so we're just sitting in these cells alone most of the time in solitary with no pillows just a no pillows no pillows no mat nothing just a space blanket and i was sleeping on my shoes yeah stinking up the place it was no good you mentioned the ufo convention yeah what have you learned from those guys the ufologists i really wanna know what you think about that that's the one question that i wanna reverse on you because you've talked to so many people mhmm do you think that aliens have actually visited earth yeah when so when exact dates i do i think there's alien civilizations everywhere i talk to a lot of people that have doubts about it i just think i even suspect there's a intelligent alien civilization in our galaxy and i just can't imagine them not having visited us so i lean on that what that actually looks like i don't know the stuff we're seeing in terms of ufo sightings i think that's much more likely to the degree it's real it's much more likely government projects so military lockheed martin this kind of stuff so you think that they have knowledge of it yeah yeah one thing i think about with aliens is scale so we have this idea that an alien would be a a gray alien or a almost humanoid look alike that would visit us in human form arms legs head but who's to say that they're not able to shrink down to microscopic size with the same neural capacity yeah or just have a very difficult to perceive form but i mean that they would go small not big no i think that would take a humanoid like form just to be able to communicate with humans i think that the the the big challenge with aliens is to be able to find a common language so if you come to another planet and you suspect that there's some kind of complexity going on but it looks nothing like humans you have to find a common language mhmm and i think aliens would try to take physical form that's similar yeah that that us dumb humans would understand language is really interesting too i have this series that i'm gonna announce for the first time on here but i'm really interested in endangered languages in the us there's like a hundred and fifty languages in the us with less than a thousand speakers wow and i wanna like help spearhead efforts to preserve some of these like for example hawaiian sign language fifteen of those people left holy shit because when hawaii got annexed the asl community tried to make it so the deaf native hawaiians wouldn't be able to speak their native sign language and so they would do it under the desks at like schools for the deaf and blind and they would get like their mouth washed out washed out with soap and stuff if they so much as did the hawaiian hand signs also the gullah geechee language in the south carolina sea islands hilton head island and stuff that's like a it's almost a creole language that's been in the us for hundreds of years existing in isolation that's being threatened by golf course developments i don't know how how into language you are but i've been getting super nerded out about it actually i'm interviewing somebody tomorrow who's an expert in human language he's from mit studying the the syntax of a lot of languages including in the amazon jungle the the peoples that live in the amazon jungle region yeah it's fascinating human language is fascinating and also the barriers that creates and also how the games are played to what you're speaking by governments this is part of the story of russia and ukraine is this is a battle over language the ukrainian language is a symbol of independence which is why they may they were trying to make it the primary language of the nation mhmm and so sometimes the language represents the culture and the peoples yeah and it's like intricately tied to the culture of the people i've been trying to learn navajo which which languages do you know spanish and english spanish well si i don't know spanish that well so that passes me yeah the you're fluent basically oh it doesn't that that that was good yeah that was real cancun spring break well i actually speak fluent spanish according to spotify because there's a a a every episode is translated overdubbed by ai in in spanish god yeah there's a very spanish robot assigned to spanish robot it's really it's i sound like incredibly intelligent and intellectual in spanish it's like a freedman exactly from everything you've done all the people you've seen do you think most people are good underneath it all yeah so the ones that do all the extreme shit okay i'll put it like this most people think they're doing the best thing for the world i don't think anyone except for maybe a small fraction of sociopaths wakes up every day and says i'm gonna fuck somebody's life up today i think the far majority of people are fighting for what they think is right and do want to see america succeed and want us to be in a happy place where no one is subjugated i just think people have drastically different ideas of what means will get us there and unfortunately that's leading to a lot of misunderstandings between cultures and yeah i think that most people are good i've been through some things that leads me to believe that a lot of people though are primarily motivated by self interest and that in a fight or flight situation most people will choose flight so i don't know if people are courageous as a whole but i think generally good but the energy to stand up for what's right not sure about that they have the capacity though yeah to do good i think human beings are inherently selfish as well but i don't think that you selfish is inherently bad i think humans are primarily motivated by self interest but generally have positive intentions i do hope more humans rise to the occasion and have courage courage of their convictions courage to have integrity but yeah i i think that most people are good and they want to do good and they have the capacity to do a lot of good mhmm that's why i have hope for this whole thing we got going on how do you heal the misunderstandings between people you think listening it's the only option we have no forced education no like forced meetings or mediations between political opponents just listen to more people and really listen try to get rid of whatever preconceived notions you might have about how you should feel about someone you are supposed to disagree with and just keep your ears and your heart open to people that you don't know and your life will change keep your heart open a lot of people are scared to listen well andrew i'm a big fan and thank you for being one of the
