i think the it's kind of fascinating to discuss with them because they've already accomplished in many cases they've already accomplished a really grand big things the olympic gold medals or running starting scaling running and winning at the game of business and then when they look back the big lesson in terms of health they often go to is the value of sleep now it's hard to know whether that lesson is supposed to be learned you're supposed to fail and then you learn it meaning you spend your twenties or your thirties or some stretch of time sacrificing sleep and it's not actually a sacrifice it's a gift to the gods of excellence so it's not like it's not supposed to be that way it's not a mistake it's not a failure but when they do look back in a kinda offhand way they'll say i learned the value of sleep that i'm just a better thinker better performer more efficient wiser all those kinds of things when i get a a full night sleep but anyway the moments you get with your bed

that i think is foundational to the way i approach diet and life when i eat once a day which is what i mostly do these days or if i fast for even longer than twenty four hours getting the electrolytes right is a big part of that and what is it about fasting that brings clarity to the mind i mean some of it is physiological i'm sure but some of it is just that feeling of longing this physical longing for satiation just feeling a little bit incomplete and sitting in that feeling but it's not the completeness that's needed for a good life for clarity of thinking it's the longing for completeness so i'm a big fan of fasting but you gotta do it in a healthy way lmnt will help you out get a sample pack for free with any purchase try it at drink lmnt dot com slash lex this episode is also brought to you by netsuite an all in one cloud business management system it's like the machine within the machine that finds the common language for the different parts of a business to communicate i'm still slightly haunted by a thing i read a long time ago that jeff bezos said that every business eventually dies and that you want to prolong the life of a business as long as possible but i i don't know why that broke my heart so much like it always does finiteness of good things i would like to believe that businesses groups of people people themselves when they're good they last forever when they do good by the world but that's not how it works does it anyway i think about the finiteness of great businesses and i guess as jeff bezos said by the way amazing human being but as jeff said the whole job of a leader of a manager of a business is to keep that first day thinking keep innovating reinvigorating being ready to pivot to make hard decisions all of that

now dear friends here's neil adams you are a five time european champion world champion two time olympic silver medalist let's first go to the nineteen eighty olympics where was your mind what was your preparation like what was your strategy leading into that olympics that was my first olympic games so my preparation was a little bit different to how it was the eighty four and the eighty eight olympic games and i'd kind of done part of the preparation as well for seventy six olympic games i wasn't quite old enough for those but i was first reserve so in nineteen eighty i'd had four years build up and i was hungry and i was one of these young athletes and i see them so often now that was developing and you know full of i won't say full of myself but i was i was certainly confident of my ability and i wanted to conquer the world and i'd had a couple of really tight matches with the current olympic world champion so i knew that there was possibility that i could get there for the eighty olympics so building up to the eighty olympics was was quite interesting because i was kinda coming through the weights and i was halfway in between the seventy one kilos weight category and the the higher weight category of seventy eight kilograms and i got third place at the seventy nine world championships the weight below for the whole year at the higher weight category didn't win a lose a contest so i'd beaten everybody in the world and and then i had to make decision as to whether to drop to the weight below because i was seeded in the weight below it was a different seeding then see i and so i decided to drop into the weight below because well because well because simply because i mean it was the only contest that i lost was the final of the olympic games in that year so you're a young kid like what like nineteen twenty at that time full confidence vigor so the decision to cut weight how hard was it for you to cut weight to the seventy one kg division i've gotta say that it was the hardest because as i was going up i was you know it was seventy three then it was seventy four kilos seventy five so i was moving through the weight category it wasn't like i was stuck in the middle and then i dropped the old time to compete it was literally going up in weight by a kilo every every month and then by the time i came to a month or two before the olympics it was really hard fought the european championships at the higher weight category and won that and so everybody that was in the on the olympic rostrum at the european at the olympic games was on my rostrum at the european championships mhmm so was it a mistake yeah because i didn't have my diet sorted out my nutrition was appalling and when i you know it wasn't as kind of readily available as it is now for the nutrition and i would say that if anything lost me that final other than the fact that i was fighting somebody was terrific you know he was a a an excellent brilliant athlete but definitely didn't help that my nutrition was was not very good okay so you lost to etsio gama there's probably a lot of that we could say about that particular match maybe let's zoom in what were your strengths and weaknesses judo wise in that olympics you said you haven't really lost the match you won the european championship leading into it but if you had weak spots okay you already said diet but specifically on the mat in terms of judo i think that's none of the fights lasted time going into the final you know so i i won fairly quickly and every match by ipon you know way before time do you remember how do you remember how you won the matches i won them by throw a couple of throws for ipon and then arm lock for ippon semifinal was an arm lock against the east german kruger and yeah i just i was flying through you know what were the throws do you remember tayatoshi uchimata my favorite kind of tokawasa my favorite throws and and then jujikitami as well to you know which was a jujikitami role against an east german who i'd beaten before but always had a really tough match but managed to beat him well so you had a beautiful exhibition of japanese type judo in the first two matches you threw people and then he also did the newasi he's on board a person great so you're going into the final what are the weaknesses going into the final against the italian like i say taking nothing away from him as a great athlete and a brilliant judo man and and left which wasn't good for me that was definite no because i hated fighting lefties still do but i'll tell you why in a minute i just did great it's one of those and but i think as i went through the contest we we had an eight hour break from the semifinal to the final they took us back to the olympic village then we had to come back in and then we had to start a warm up again you know so i kinda lost my momentum i had to start again and i never i didn't i just didn't i had a job to get going i got halfway through started to rescue a dying match and you know i was kind of one step half a step behind all the way through so never really got into it so why do you hate fighting lefties and lefties are we should say overrepresented in terms of the high ranks of judo i don't know why that is well you know the thing is about a lefty is a lefty will have more opportunity to fight right as you know right handers because i mean seventy seventy percent of the population are right handers thirty percent left so they get to fight more right handers mhmm and it's just a fact you know that happens so the thing that they hate is fighting left against left they don't like they would they don't like it left against left whereas a right hander will go right against right you know but but the opposite is awkward for me because just simply i like to go onto the sleeve and then i like to dominate the grips but the actual angle of the of the opponent wasn't what i wanted you know so i had to work hard really hard against it what happened in that match it was a split decision in the end and so to lose an olympic final on a split decision is is pretty you know it's it's something that's still on my mind and you know i think that it's a strange one because i can still wake up that one and and four years later at the olympics because i was silver medalist at the the olympics four years later as well and yeah it still haunts me do you sometimes wake up and think like man i should have eaten better or like or maybe like a specific grip that you're like i shouldn't have taken that grip i do you know i mean the diet side of it it's it's difficult to you know to to really admit that isn't it that you you went to an olympic games and the one thing that you've really sucked at right was one of the most important things now at at world level sport you know where you've got the nutrition you know we've got it you would think that most people have got it sorted but there's still people making mistakes there's still people that haven't got it totally sorted and then there's people like travis stevens who i think doesn't care he'll just have atrocious nutrition and he just makes it work i think the way he spoke about it is you can't always control nutrition so it's best to get good at having crappy nutrition it's a good way of looking at it i never yeah maybe that's what i did yeah exactly exactly do you remember what you were eating are you were we talking about like candy or yeah well i got a sweet tooth you know but i wasn't it wasn't really i mean i didn't have a lot of money at that particular time either you know so the diet wasn't steak and and you know good nutritional salads and things like that you know i i did what i thought was best without you know proper advice and the crazy thing is is that i had such good advice as well you know when it came to kind of fitness training and things like that we're quite ahead of our time and you know we really had it nailed as far as the conditioning was concerned the judo training as well was was way in advance because i was a good trainer and i trained more than most mhmm i would i can honestly say that it probably got me away with a a you know a lot where was your mind so mental preparation going into that olympics you said you were confident but is there some preparation aspect behind that confidence i think in the early days i didn't think i was gonna lose i never thought it was possible to lose and i think that i went into every contest expecting to win so when it didn't quite go my way i didn't lose that many contests you know so the only ones i lost were in the final of the world championships or in the final of the olympic games so i didn't lose that many i never lost a european title you know i had seven golds at european championships you know five seniors to juniors under twenties and i never i never lost a final you know so it was and then i only lost two on a split decision you know so it was i didn't lose that many but and and my attitude was that i wasn't gonna lose and i i couldn't lose you know so i was always surprised when i did it when i you know something happened in neal adams a life in judo written in nineteen eighty six you wrote ever since i can remember i have wanted to win it wasn't the ordinary feeling that children have when they take part in their first primary school sack race on a grass track or even the keen determination of a young swimmer prepared to train early in the cold winter mornings in order to make it into the county side with me the desire to win was and still is as much a part of me as my arms and legs in other words it wasn't something i learned as i grew older but rather was deeply rooted in me perhaps this competitive instinct is the greatest difference between my public image and the view from the inside so people see the kindness the the warmth you have the the the the charisma the excitement but there's this big drive to win inside you so what what's behind that can can you just speak to that that drive to win and how that contributed to your no when when i when i look back now it's a it's a lot of years ago i should say it is a lot of years ago is that is that true or is it speaking to it far off no you know it's not for when i think about it now because i'm a i'd like to think that i'm a different person now and you know since i've kind of calmed down i i see athletes now and i see them they they you know and they they kind of arrogance they they walk and it's a strut you know and it's it's a kind of a confidence isn't it you know and and we as we're older and as i've become older i've i've calmed down and but you know it doesn't matter what i'm doing it's still that will to to win mhmm you know and and i'm much better at masking it now if i don't but it still bothers me as much you're talking about like i don't know even just like stupid silly things like a like i don't know a game of pool or something like this or just anything yeah i'm still trying to win you know like so my son loves to he loves to play me at bowls because i'm useless you know and i'm i just can't throw a straight bowl so he loves playing me at that you know but i it bugs me that i'm not better you know and yeah there are certain things that i do it really bugs me when i'm not good at it and i guess it's one of the reasons that you know long after i'd finished competition judo people still wanna train with you you know and even at a like kind of an older age even now if i do in a seminar or you know they'd still you know do you still do do you do you wanna still go and can i feel it and you know one of the things that's in me is that i just all the way up to forty years of age so from thirty when i finished competition up to forty i could still train with the best and i could still go with anybody and then when forty hit i kind of things started to fall off a little bit you know and i used to get you know either my hips or my do my legs and my knees and and i realized that i had to pick my practices and that were ankle as well and i had to then just calm it down a little bit otherwise i was gonna be injured and i was gonna be you know so it's it's not a good thing when you're getting older and you you've still got the same competitive mind but things change so it's still there you get on a on the mat probably even now right you get on the mat with a world champion you're still the current world champion there's still a little part of you oh yeah yeah could i still toss this guy but you know and kids these days are soft i do i don't think i well you know what some of these athletes i mean like i give you a prime example right is ilias ilias yeah alright i mean he is a monster right yeah and you just of course you couldn't you know because just at sixty something you couldn't but you like to think that you could yeah you know and then you could you never know you're gonna find out you know what you would do what you can do is you can cause them problems but and they feel it immediately but you'd last a minute you know so you've trained with the lysality artist because i i've gotten a chance to train with them as well he's a really nice guy really great guy he's really he trained with me we we were training together every hotel that we used to go into we'd end up in the gym together and we'd train and this one time he was in there and he just wanted somebody to to grab and grip hold of and so we ended up doing this kind of grappling in the middle of you know like the people doing weight training and you know the different things watching these two mad men doing i'm glad we weren't on a mat at that particular time yeah but good fun what do you think about that guy he like you achieved a lot of success when he was young seventeen can you imagine that seventeen eighteen years of age and he's able to compete with the men there's not many men can do that you know and it doesn't happen very often it happens later with the men and often they're not physically as developed as they you know so for me for example i fought nevzorov who was world olympic champion he was the current world olympic champion they sent me to the european championships senior at seventeen and so that doesn't happen very often and i fought i pulled nevzoroff so i fought nevzorov and i he i had him really worried you know because i he expected without a doubt to come out throw this kid you know and junior and he was like thick and shredded like as soon as he's in bed he was shredded he's like there's a picture of him in his judogi and his judogi is just cut and it's you know and he looks the business and there's me in this baggy like yeah skinny kid inside this baggy thing but i you know i and the thing was is that the more he tried and the harder he tried and the more he panicked the further it went away from him and so you know of course he got he got got the decision at the end and deservedly but i worried him you know and so and and so for me that was a massive step forward because year later i was you know starting to fill out and two years later i was competing for the olympic title so i don't know if i remember but iliadus is interesting because even at seventeen i feel like he was doing big throws like literally lifting them with the edge rips them out the ground you know and i was saying to to nikki you know my wife and we she said what would you do now that was different than the way you did then you know and i said i've i never had any pickups you know i didn't i that's not that's not what we did you know but you have a look at the the young ukraines or the the you know the young russians or the young eastern bloc mongolians and they're ripping people out the ground i mean it's it's just different style of judo and it's it it just looks different but now they're starting to do traditional style judo as well so can you speak to that what are the different styles of judo so for you you mentioned uchimada taitoshi these these how would you describe them they're like these effortless less lifting off the the ground and power and like strength and explode and more timing and yeah movement moment moment momentum all this kind of stuff that's more traditionally associated with japanese judo because like for japanese judo the traditional judo like you're supposed to throw people in a big way without much effort and of course we nineteen ninety we saw the introduction eastern bloc countries you know the there were so many more i mean it was soviet union when i was competing and then of course in nineteen ninety everything changed and then there were so many more of them out there different countries where you know that that their wrestling styles were were introduced into judah you know put a jacket on them and let's get into judah so judo kinda changed shape it it changed shape from this upright standing you know the and and having to know the technicalities of how to get a a body that's weighing forty you know fourteen stone or you know whatever it is up into the air and using the momentum and the balance and the direction and and the and the skill to do that and knowing how to do it you know and how to use movement and then you get you know the wrestlers and and and the the the leg picks and the double legs single legs double legs and you know and it kind of by nineteen ninety five you know judo was was bent over mhmm and so it was the ioc that went to ijf international judo federation and they said you gotta change this or we're just gonna have one wrestling style it looks like wrestling with judo with judo jackets on so you either change it or we're gonna take one of you out by the way we should sort of clarify when we say people are bent over that's usually how you see freestyle wrestling wrestlers are more bent over to defend the legs and so on and traditional judo people are more standing up because that's the position for which you can do the big throws and all that kind of stuff but i think the other case to make for banning leg grabs is you know a lot of people are using it for stalling and not for beautiful big throws and all that kind of stuff yeah so it's not just not to make it different from wrestling it's it's also like you want to maximize the amount of epic throws and dynamic judo and exciting stuff to watch right yeah win by judo not not by wrestling and i think that you know the ones that were shouting about it were the wrestlers right because they they they like to compete with both they like they wanna do both they wanna do you know their wrestling matches and and then come into judo yeah so what basically i mean what what we've said is they learn to do judo and there's nothing stopping you then from doing both right but not from the other way around alright so rules always dictate development they'll always dictate which direction it goes so if you introduce a rule that states that you cannot dive at the legs and just pick up then you'll have to do it standing up and also it increases the possibility of defense with the hips because actually good defense judo wise standing up is with the hips as opposed to sticking your arms out and then sticking your backsides out there just to defend alright so if you attack me and i i i move my body in the wrong place so i'm in the right wrong place at the right time so you don't hit the right target and then also i use my hips you know so again it's it's a form of judo that was being lost so now we got it back well so let's go there let's let's speak about judo as if we're talking to a group of five year olds so what what is judo what are some defining characteristics of judo as a sport as a way as a martial art as a way of life all that kind of stuff i think you know when you say it is a way of life i mean the i think the the great advantage that we have in judo my young grandson so i got two two little boys that are three and a half years of age they love going to our dojo they love it you know so dojo was the first word that they used it was one of the first so when they come see us you know so as i see my wife and i you know it's like dojo it's not grandma granddad you know it's a dojo so dojo they take their shoes off going into the dojo you know so they have respect for where they're at you know and i think it has that kind of feeling that like i tried to build my dojo with a feeling of reverence it's kind of almost peaceful you know so if i'm not religious i'm not a religious person but i like going to old churches because when i go into an old church doesn't matter you know what the religion within the church but it there's a there's a reverence in there reverence is a good word it it feels like a really special place no matter which dojo you go to it's just you bow and there's calmness before the storm of battle or whatever it is and respect you know yeah respect look at the respect you know we were just talking about it just before we came on on air we were just saying that we very very seldom do we have a situation where there is animosity other than them fighting you know so i'm i'm not saying that they don't fight each other because sometimes it does turn into a brawl and at the end two people bow off and show their respect you know and and one of the things that you know like so a champion i see people winning events and they're good judo kara they're excellent they win world championships might even win the olympic games but a great champion for me is is somebody who treats who who does the right thing when they lose you know so when you see them lose that's when you see the true them you know and that actually that was one of the biggest things that i had to really cope with you know so when i lost the olympic games in moscow and also the one in in los angeles the hardest thing is when the microphone's in there and and you've got to be respectful and nice and and the hardest thing's to smile mhmm but actually some of the great champions you know they'll they'll go that's just one match you know i remember we've got we've got one great champion ag beg ninu mhmm she's a five time world champion she's an olympic champion she's got she's favorite as well to to get this olympic gold medal french mhmm what a great champion she is you know because she lost one of the matches i mean she'd come back and she'd given birth come back after giving birth and everybody was going well was she you know but then she and then she lost one of the matches on the way through and she said well don't be don't be upset you know it's just one match it's just one contest you know next time i'm gonna put it right and she did put it right and now she's back up there and she she won the world title back so you know these these are great champions for me yeah i mean that's the right way to see it but it's also tragic to lose the olympic games you know twice thank you yes it is tragic and i do i do have sleepless nights i mean that's the magic of the olympic games anything can happen and your nineteen eighty olympics were very different from the nineteen eighty four but if we just link on the on the eighty and just your what we're talking about how much you wanted to win do you love winning or hate losing more i hate losing more but i love winning when i won the world title a year later and i had no doubt when i went into that day that i was gonna be world champion no doubt so you won the eighty one world championship at the higher weight at the higher the seventy eight yes kg actually can we go there what what what was going through your mind you ended up arm barring a japanese fighter i talked to jimmy pedro a friend of yours somebody who said you were a mentor to him for many years and he's told me a bunch of different questions to ask you but he said that was a really special time that was a really special like dominant run you had and especially finishing with an arbor against a japanese player so take me through that what do you remember from that i think that it was so my weight was better i didn't have to lose weight that was one thing so the nutritional side wasn't as important but probably you know it still wasn't as good as it could be mind in in nutrition although it was getting better and i was trying to eat the right things at the right time but i still trained really well and i was so confident there going into that world championships that i could win it i had no doubt in my mind that i was gonna win but you know obviously corner of your mind you're thinking just don't make mistakes but you know this is the incredible thing is is that once you start to ask you once i see contests change direction when i'm commentating so i can see somebody who's in there just going forward just trying to win alright so that and that's the difference to somebody who's trying not to lose mhmm and there's two different ways there you know so sometimes when you so when i was world champion then i had a period of time where every time i stepped out there i was really afraid of losing mhmm and and i think that that's what happens later on in your competitive career you know the great champions managed to come through that teddy renaer is one of those you know he he just he puts it out there and he keeps beating them you know so they can't take it away from them you know it's it's it's fantastic so stepping on the mat every single encounter you're trying to win you're looking for the grips and the with the intention to throw throw big even when you're ahead on points all that kind of stuff that's a really good point is that if you go ahead in a match and you look at the clock it depends when you go ahead so sometimes you can go ahead in the first minute and you've still got three minutes to go so i see the ones then that go into i don't wanna lose because they go into defensive mode and then sometimes they can lose it on penalties or something can go wrong and the other one comes on strong and then they can sneak the contest and so it's it's really difficult but what when i was coaching i was trying to always encourage that positive attitude for the full four minutes five minutes then i've competed a lot in judo and jiu jitsu i've always hated that part of myself when i'm up on points by a lot you look at the clock and it's what you do when you look at the clock i'd say minute and a half you're really tired and you kinda quit you just defend yeah and it's like hated that part about myself it's like that saying don't do it yeah well as opposed to just go out in for in judo that's a for for a big throw just keep going for the throw in jiu jitsu it's go for the submission like throw caution like win in the real way versus on on on points and i hate that part i mean mostly underneath that is cowardice induced by exhaustion exhaustion's the one isn't it yeah but but it is isn't it it's a mindset as well you know so actually trying to get your mind positive all the way through you know so i i mean if you listen when i commentate to noah is i say i hope that they don't change the mindset and that they keep on and they are going forward all the time you know and actually they're then more difficult to catch we had won just a couple of weeks ago and he lost in the final second mhmm of the contest lost the final he was the only one to score he got penalized all the way up two seconds to go and stepped out of the area and you know but he went like that thinking the bell was just going and the bell went one second after mhmm he actually stepped out so he got penalized lost the match and lost all of the points for qualification so it was it was you know that's paying high price let's pay a high price yeah i mean that's there's a thin thin line between triumph and tragedy in in those competitions but especially at the olympic games so let's just stick on eighty one world championship what did it feel like to win that world championship like and also getting an armbar as a japanese player jamie told me your arms were exhausted yeah i mean you you just i the thing is is sometimes you know when you're going when it's competitive as well you know hours is a different intensity to like to just where where you can take time a little bit hours is bang it's transitioning from standing down you've got ten fifteen seconds to go in there you go in a hundred percent it's a bit like running you know full out for ten seconds like and then you've gotta decide then especially if they're defending it whether you let it go because when you get up and your forearms are blown you know and you've got lactic acid in there and you've still got to grip up because remember ours is about gripping as well on the jacket mhmm so if you can't grip up then you can't gain the advantage then they can throw you you know so you have to decide so i i had a massive attack on him and we changed directions four or five times and and then i i wasn't gonna let him go but i still you know when i was turning him there i had to decide am i gonna go all out for this and and just or you know like there has been occasions when i've kind of released it mhmm to just you know if i got a minute to go and just just block out yeah so so what you're saying on the feet there was a change of direction or all different kinds of attempts and then you went to the ground and that's yeah so what was that do you remember that decision of like okay am i gonna finish this yeah i knew it i i just as soon as i climbed his back and and then i thought he's not going he's not gonna i'm not gonna let him up you know so i was just changing change voice in your head little little something in my head was going don't don't you know just stick on him and and then it's always about pressure on the arm and and i just you know and of course he was like that you know where the defending you know he was almost total bridge trying to get out of it did it start in turtle and then like did you pull it started in turtle because i i did an attack came back out of the attack and then he went on to his front and then i was on his back and then i started the whole opening you just went for it just i was it was an automatic transition so i mean the transitions are what we teach you know because the ones that are quicker down with the transitions are the ones that catch it that's our neewasa you know our groundwork is the transition from standing down to ground it's very you know we don't have a situation where you can kind of work your way in you are in or you're you're not in you're standing you know so you gotta make sure that you're in and so i had i was just on his back like a leech and i never let him go so you see i mean yeah so that's where the armbars that's where the attacks on the ground which is called neuwaza happens in the transition yes at that level at that high world class level yeah i mean he was no muggy though i i think he just got third third place in the all japan championships which is all weight categories so he was he wasn't a mug you know he was he was strong and i'd fought him once before and and i knew he was a lefty as well which was really awkward for me did he feel good better for me than him did he it did it felt it felt amazing you know because it was almost like all these things disappointments and everything had kind of come to this one point where i was at last kind of champion of the world you know it's everything i said as a kid that i had no idea how difficult it was gonna be you know so as a kid as a fourteen year old kid i remember saying i'm gonna be world champion i'm gonna be the best of the world i had no idea how difficult that was gonna be well there's wisdom to that right like there's power and stupidity of youth i like that right like it is just just like i'm gonna be a world champion i'm gonna win this without knowing how hard it is and then once you go after it it's you're trapped you're gonna have to do the work yeah well i mean you see it a lot with parents as well don't you you know parents you know how little johnny is he's you know he's amazing and he's this that and the other and they have no idea what's you know out there i remember the very first time i i stepped out nineteen seventy four into the european cadets and i remember that we were fighting i'd only ever fought in great britain i was the top you know i'd i i was unbeaten in in the juniors kids and went out there and there were these different fighters out there that were treating me with total disdain and i remember thinking how dare they you know that it just you know and i realized when i came back from that event there's other people out there there's just a whole you know and there are different levels of you know the the majority of people are just not informed as to what's out there and the different levels that there are out there do you remember like a a certain opponent that for the first time you felt like holy shit yeah there's pop like somebody just gripped you up and you're like this is there's another level to this game ezio was ed ezio was one of them and i fought him you know and i beat him in the european championships i beat him in you know two two times and then lost to him in the olympic games two months after i'd beaten him in the european championship yeah yeah so it wasn't that that that made even more difficult right nemesis there yeah so that made it more difficult and so he ezio was one and getting hold of i remember getting hold of nishida of japan and he had me going up and down and i just i thought wow this guy is amazing you know and i'd never fought first time i ever fought japanese in a major tournament you know and i felt the danger i always talk about the danger when we go out to japan to train mhmm i could go probably months without getting thrown in training here in europe and and i go to japan and you know everybody's thrown you you know and that's difficult to accept and the reason that that kind of danger and that kind of a feeling of danger is something that puts a real edge on you know and so that was first time when i got a hold of nishida i thought oh my god you know this guy you know for no it didn't matter which way he was turning like that he had me stretched out and and i thought this i i wanna do this you know and then i ended up fighting him again in japan so that feeling of danger is really interesting it's like i've i've you know did randori with a lot of world class people from different parts of the world including elias elias and like there's certain part like eastern european judo you're you feel like you're screwed the whole way through like the gripping you really feel it in the gripping it's the gripping that does it but in with with japan like really good japanese style judoka you don't it's like it's a terrifying calmness or at least at least the experiences i've had you don't really feel it in the gripping you just feel like anywhere you step you're getting thrown it's a different it's a different thing isn't it it's a different thing so i mean mine was kind of a mixture i liked it to be a mixture because there was the gripping is definitely the key point so if you get a high level guys that are gripping up and i always used to put this to the referees when we were doing referee seminars when we first started them and i'd say how many because like they would referee to their understanding of the match mhmm so they were penalizing for certain grips that were you know and and actually so as an ex athlete high level i would say have you ever gripped up with eye level alright because if you haven't you need to do it because then you will understand why they do certain things with the grips because these guys are like you know when somebody grips you and you think you know you're gonna go when eliadeus puts his arm over your back alright and he he you you know you're gonna go up and over yeah you know you're gonna go over you know that's it that's a cool feeling it's like whatever for me well i understand but it's like i mean because it's not it's it feels way more powerful than it should yeah it's weird i don't know you wanna attribute it to strength and all that kind of stuff i mean people say you have like immense upper body strength but it's probably something else it's like technique it's some kinda weird it's a mix of everything just like something hardened through lots of battles in randorian that kind of stuff yeah but it's cool that humans are able to generate that kind of power it's cool when i was eighty four olympics where but i'm just gonna go there now just quickly but there was we had a freestyle wrestler he's american actually but he had the english nationality so he competed for noel loban his name is and he competed for great britain he got third place at the olympics in eighty four but he was training we were training at budokai and he was training he came to do some judo and put jacket on and of course he was training with some of the lower levels and he was really handling himself well and then he said i need to feel you know he he when we did randery you know so i he did some randery with me and and i immediately thought i gotta catch it i gotta stop single leg and double leg because he he was really quick right so strong as well ninety something kilos he was like you know he's a big guy so i caught his sleeve immediately caught mhmm and controlled him and and then he couldn't start right so he said i needed to feel the difference so then i thought i better reciprocate this so i said well you know so we did the randuri and i throw him a couple of times he said i'm really glad we did that so then i said i i need to feel the difference as well so we take the jackets off so we took the jackets off and he was a nightmare this guy was a nightmare and like a monster you know he was like single legging me and and you know it was just totally different you know so it it was like the jacket makes a massive difference huge difference to something you know and and people think it's just a jacket that we're wearing but it isn't it's it's our only tool actually yeah and it's control i mean it's a way of establishing control over another body yeah and it's a whole art form and a science and i don't even know if you understand it really you understand it sort of subconsciously through time yeah because i get there's so much involved because pulling on one part of the jacket pulls other parts of the jacket and yeah like the physics of that is probably insane to understand it's absolutely insane and then you know they they changed the rules for a little while and they changed the rules so that you couldn't hold you know that certain grips were not allowed they were only allowed a certain amount of time and there were a lot of penalties from it and then you know they had some of the ex fighters into the referee commission and so we were pushing for just let them grip yeah you know because that's that's that's our game you know that's what makes us different you know again if if grip up with somebody like so they were on about teddy renee yeah teddy renee comes out takes the sleeve yeah big arm over the top and and then you know he throws people right so they were saying yeah but stop you can't stop him doing it this guy is six foot nine yeah and he is built like golf you know he's like and he's he's and not only that he's skillful as well you know and and and he's got that mentality of a winner mhmm he has got that mentality of a winner there he just wins important matches and he goes over the top of the grip do they where does that land now in terms of rules over the top because those are some of the most epic awesome types of grips yeah just like over the top just big grab yeah well as long as they throw from it mhmm so they can take any grip as long as you move them and then catch them kind of action reaction really you know as long as you catch them on the move then you can do it so as long as you're not using it to stall or or that kind of stuff yeah you can't block out yeah so i mean if i so like for example if i've got dominant grip on you and i just block out and i just stop i just stop you attacking me so then what i get you three penalties get you off and you haven't done an attack so we've gotta stop that you can't have that yeah yeah definitely you were the favorite to win the nineteen eighty four olympics but you got silver i watched that match several times you probably haven't have it playing in your head so there is a a nice change of direction by your opponent german frank wenneke yep it was a fake right uchimada and then to a left drop sayonagi how did that loss feel devastating is is not you know is not enough really because you know the strange thing was is coming into that olympics i was tired really tired so my mental state wasn't the best wasn't certainly the same as it was coming into the previous and i i i remember thinking i just need to get this over with and then i'm gonna have a break and just have a rest you know and and that's totally the wrong attitude you know it's just not not good for for going into an olympic games and so i i was coming in there with a different mindset and i remember every match that i had i was winning well but i was winning with a struggle you know it was it was really not i'd fought novak and i was pretty of france who was one of the strongest physically that was in the quarter finals i beat brett barron by an ipon i i arm locked him i won my first match by ipon as well and then michel novakai was fighting a france and i was lucky to to to win it i was up i would scored on him but i was like starting to defend and just everything that i talked to you about you know and then just about held on and and then i won and you know so him and i were talking afterwards like some years afterwards and he said i was close wasn't i i was i said yeah but not close enough no i didn't mean it yeah yeah but i had to say it right of course of course so i and no he was right you know and it was one of those so i threw to the semifinal i fought lessac in the semifinal of and i'd fought him in the semifinal of the worlds as well i'd never gone time with him you know i'd never i'd always beaten him fairly easily and with and that went time so i was you know i was i just just glad to get it done and i was in the final then against frank vinicke of germany and i'd beaten vinicke before but he was just a young german coming through and when i started the final i was i thought right i've just i and i started all my techniques just that little bit off nothing was coordinated just it was just i can't really explain why it was just a little bit off i i see it so often now with a lot of the guys that are going for second third olympic games and i see their their technique just not quite there and they're struggling and and i know when they're you know i know what they're going through and i i kind of empathise with them well you're it felt like you were dominating that final i dominated it yeah i was winning yeah i i and and actually if it had got another minute and a half it would have been all over and i would have been olympic champion and it would have been done he wouldn't have batted an eyelid right because he he would have fought me really really well mhmm and he would have you know we talked about it afterwards and he said it was just my good day for me you know and he knows he was very respectful this guy is very respectful he was surprised almost i mean not almost he was very surprised and celebrating like a a surprise there jumping up and down like you know he does and you you look at that can't you go well it wasn't ippon but you know would i got it back i don't know but i just i think that actually taking the pressure off because that was another thing as well pressure of being favourite you know and i see that with a lot of them and you know the great champions the ones that keep coming through capellic there's a guy you know he can look very ordinary and then comes the big tournament and he he'll win it the tragedy of the olympic games i mean you were the favorite and just like that like split moment you lost it split moment devastating and lift it probably not every day but you know nikki my wife will tell you that woken up in sweats and and you know i and i think they contributed as well because i had a period of my my life after where i was drinking too much and you know and and i i think kind of when i look back kinda led into though that that kind of dark period in my life you know and i never ever ever you know did it go through my mind anything else but it definitely affected me and i was on a downward kind of spiral in a lot of different ways and would still even you know we we we have an amazing marriage and we have an amazing family and everything's great but i still wake up sometimes and i'll say i've just dreamt you know that and it's the same reoccurring dream where i'm trying to get somewhere and i'm trying to put it right you know and i i i've got this chance of putting this olympic final right you know in in in this dream i've got a chance of doing it but i can't get there and the traffic's stopping me or something stops me and i you know and then i wake up and i'm sweating and it just and you think well after all this time that's not possible but it is and it happens yeah i mean in the match itself there's that feeling for for me just watching it like you're you're you're going for throws you're you're you're almost getting there with the throws and it's almost like he's going for a kind of crappy utimata and then you're just like you're stopping you're blocking it and all of a sudden i mean that's the beauty of the olympics he finds it in himself to switch yeah in that like against a favorite against sort of the great british judoka just finds the perfect dropsy and nagi well you know he his his team doctor and coach he came up to me afterwards and said i'm just really sorry and that's all they said is i'm just really sorry they were sorry because you know obviously the obvious sadness about that you know and and of course everybody takes their you know i went actually two and a was it three weeks later the german open so he he had to compete in the german open three weeks later so i went over to fight him and and beat him in the final of the german open and it didn't do anything for me because it was a much tighter match he was a lot closer he had a lot more confidence coming in so he fought me a lot differently and then it was me pulling it back and just managing to win in the final and i thought well that might appease it appeased nothing didn't do anything when you give your whole life to judo just and your love of winning that's crazy how much the olympic games mean it it means so much and i i think you know but i i've gotta and i've gotta say this and this is honestly you know if it meant that if i'd have won that olympic games and it had to change my life into a different direction which i probably would have not competed in the eighty eight olympic games then alright so if it had changed my life and then i didn't have i didn't meet my wife and i you know didn't have my family that i've got now there's no you know i would i wouldn't swap that what i've got now for anything well part of the demons that you've gotten to know because of those losses is part of probably the central reason that made you the man you are a legend of the sport you could have been not that because an olympic gold is just an olympic gold yeah and it is isn't it you know and i think that there's a lot of olympic champions and world champions that win and then are forgotten and i said to nikki i said my wife i said i don't wanna be forgotten and i wanna be remembered so if i'm gonna do anything anything i do if i'm gonna do commentary or whatever it is coaching i wanna do coaching to a high level and i wanna commentate at a high level i remember the first commentary i ever did it was terrible and and i just thought i've got to do better than this and i i thought i just i need to do it well and i've gotta do it professionally so in the book a game of throws you have a chapter titled lessons in losing so what are some of the lessons here what are the some of the deeper lessons you've pulled out of losing i think great champions are made up of the people that handle it in the right way and you could say well i i don't like losing and i you know and you could throw your dummy out the pram and you can be a bad loser in front of everybody and actually people pick up on that very very quickly you know what it's like in broadcasting right mhmm somebody has a a bad word to say about somebody and yep yep and you it but but actually the ones that endear themselves to you are the ones that handle it in the right way the correct way doesn't mean that you've gotta like it i didn't like it and i thought that i handled it certainly in later years in the right way and i like to see athletes do it in the right way you know and i i think that's it's a make or break situation it's not all the contests they win it's the one that they lose and then how they pick themselves up and handle themselves after so i think that that is a big one for me and also i mean i i went through you know obviously a later divorce and that was difficult on my son really difficult on ashley and then i was and i think that some of that was the fact that i was you know kind of i wasn't drinking all the time but i was drinking in excess at the wrong times you know and i think that that's what a lot of people do sometimes is that they use it for the wrong reasons you know and i i used to hear it i still i hear it now all the time you know and it's that you know i i need to knock the edge off and i need need to just forget and i need to you know and you need to be in a fuzzy place for a while and i had a lot of time in in fuzzy place and i needed to get rid of that you know and i needed to clear my head where was that place some of the lower points in your life that you've reached mentally i think you know definitely you know the fact that my marriage first marriage didn't work you know and that was you know it's a mix of things that you know between us and and then you know so that's not where i wanted to be at the time and the effects that it had on my son and it took a long time for him then to come round and to to trust me again you know and and to have belief he always had belief in me but to trust me again and then i think that that that was low and and i think that you know when i look back is that a lot of my bad decisions were when i was in that fuzzy kind of haze and that it it got progressively worse that got progressively worse to the degree where it was you know trying to hide it and trying to hide how much and i was kind of a functioning kind of drunk i you know i i think you could probably say that and i you know i was functioning i was still able to i was still training most days crazily enough you know i was training to kind of mask it and cover it and that was probably my saviour that i was still you know because i i remember i said to my wife i said to nicky i'm probably the fittest if if i'm you know a drunk then i'm a fittest drunk in the world she said yeah you probably are actually you know i was in great condition for a drunk so the the the fuzzy haze where was your mind did you have periods of depression i had periods of depression i i can honestly say that my my depression wasn't that bad although i did you know when it's like anything that gives you an up you know it gives you an even bigger down doesn't it you know and so i hated that feeling and also hated myself for letting it happen because i i have got this really it's a bizarre i don't know whether you can call it a power but i i have the ability to be able to say stop and i i i can just and that's what i did in the end in the end there was an incident when i was working for belgium judo and there was an incident it was christmas it was the i tell you exactly the day it was twentieth of december and me and a belgian coach we got absolutely hammered but we were at the wrong place and he got noticed and and so i remember they they pulled me up in front of this board and i looked down at these guys and half of them were people i didn't want to be in that situation with you know they're they're not people that i respected and they're not people that i trusted so i said if you're gonna sack me sack me but i'd gonna i'll promise you now that i will just this this is it i'll stop i'm just gonna stop i've decided on the way back in the car i rang nikki up my wife and i said dude whatever you hear now whatever i'm just gonna stop so that was it stopped you just saw the moment that said stop stop so that fuzzy place what advice could you give to people about how to overcome that that dark place the depression whether it has to do with drinking or not i think if it's to do with drinking all i can say is is that the two days or a week into not drinking you'll feel different you know they it'll make a physical difference and you'll like that physical difference and then from a mental perspective as well because i think that you know you you have a massive downer you know and i i think that that must be because of drugs as well because i had a situation with my brother you know he was like you know he was professional wrestling and the drugs was an element there and you know so i'd never touched a drug or even seen one in my life but you know i'd let the alcohol side go too far and then decided never to do that so then i guess i had people ringing me up you know saying you know how how can we stop you know so when they say can i have a word can i discuss something with you and i know then what they want to discuss with me you know and and the thing is is that i would say you know you've if you stop then feel the effects of it and it will make a difference to your everyday life and that will make a massive difference and i think about anybody who kind of you know is down all the time is to find the the cause of what's pushing you down you know what i mean and and and try and try and attack that i mean you know because it's never somebody once said to me they said whatever you got you know we've got something special i mean we have a great life and i've had a great competition record you know it could have been better but it was great but i've had success with my business and we're still out there and we have a great life we travel all the world and you know there's people out there that would live in your house at the drop of a hat wherever you are they drive your car you know no matter what car it is some people haven't got a car you know and whatever food you're having and you're moaning about food right there there's somebody out there that would take that and gladly eat that alright so there's always somebody worse off than you and i think that we tend to sometimes you know look at the things that we haven't got rather than things we have got yeah it's a skill probably just to be grateful for the things you have exactly as you said and this sometimes the little things like food and yeah cars and all that kind of stuff just to to have gratitude for and family and all this kind of stuff but still i i you know having talked to a bunch of olympic athletes there is a you know when you give so much of your life to winning and then you lose sometimes even when you win but when you lose at the very top it's a tough tough like tough thing to go through the most difficult thing i think for anybody is when they have to decide when to stop yeah yeah you know and and that all of a sudden and i i see the ones that are going to second olympic games and then third olympic and and the ones that are there and they're holding on and they're in their thirties now different to when they were nineteen years of age you know thirty something is different to nineteen and then what are you gonna do afterwards you know and then how do you become just a normal person you're never gonna be a normal person as such but i think you've gotta do normal things you know and then you've got i remember the first time that when i finished competition i had good sponsors this was you know forty years ago but i had two really good sponsorships vitamin company and also a judogi company and i had a car and do you know i had money i just and and i was going all over the world i was successful and then i stopped and they took everything back they took my car they did and they did it within two weeks as well they stopped my funding they you know and the vitamin company said thank you very much it's been a great you know we we've done well by you bye bye this was after your last olympics eighty eight olympics yeah eighty eight you know when that finished and then that was it you know and then it's right okay first time i had to go in there and buy a tracksuit and a pair of training shoes yeah wow yeah those are different sitting there in the evening by yourself so you go from seven days a week or six days a week going into the gym and and you know you're working out the dojo and and then you then you don't have to do it you know that's why you get a lot of when they finish competition they finish that thirty to forty it's still i mean elias is still doing it now he's still in there and he's still yeah you know and he because he can right okay and and and that it's natural and i did exactly the same and then like i say you just get to an age and you just think well i'm just gonna kind of take a step back which is why like there's certain athletes like rio kotani never stops it just dominates for fourteen years probably one of the winningest athletes in judo yeah seven time world champ two time olympic champ medaled at five olympics so it's always impressive we never stopped never stopped so that's an option if you're like the greatest ever it'd be interesting wouldn't it just to see what they're doing now you know i mean because at some stage you have to get a normal you do have to stop you do have to stop you know at some stage you have to decide what you're gonna do you know it's either into coaching the judo is either to coaching or if you're not in coaching then it's into something to do with the media and you know i was lucky that i it was just by accident really with the commentary somebody said would you do a voice over so i did this voice over and that was back in nineteen eighty two i did that so you've been commentating since nineteen eighty two i did some voice overs i wouldn't call it commentating mhmm but i did some voiceovers and and then i did some we did we did some different european championships world championship kind of events and i did the voiceovers for it and the way that it was done that it was more narration and so it kind of turned into then somebody asked me to do an event and when you listen to the intonation of the voice and stuff like that it wasn't like it is now but i guess that's just something that developed as a you know because then it was coming from the heart mhmm and i you know started to get excited and just do my thing and it was just me really it's just my style well i've listened to your commentary from a while back i don't know if it's the eighties but it's still there i think your timing as well isn't it it's like you know you get your timing a bit better and know when to go in when to come out yeah yeah when to say something when not you know and i think that in the early days i tended to think i tended to want to talk all the time and you don't have to do that oh so knowing when to shut up that's the key isn't it yeah part of the dramas and the silence building up to the to the to the setup and the throw and all that kind of stuff but also you're very good at while radiating passion being very precise and specific about the details of the throw and the setup and why something worked and didn't so yeah i think i think there's two kinds of commentating you can commentate what you see and then you commentate what people can't see you know and and so if you've got somebody that is not really understanding of what's happening in the inner part of the game so it might be a technical thing or it might be the tactical part of the play here that's going on and if you can introduce that as well then you've got an advantage quick pause i need a breath and break okay good stuff so we just took a little break and went to judo tv dot com which is i guess an igf website and igf is the organization behind a lot of the big judo events in the world and i just signed up you should sign up too that's great absolutely sign up cheaper the price cheaper the price yep and you can watch basically any match from the the the grand slams and going back through history i guess yeah i've got to say lex i mean everybody still people are saying to me oh you you know we need more judo on television they've got judo on television every other week that they can access all of the top people in all the top events and it costs a hundred dollars a year you know it's it's to access everything and they can play all the videos i mean we've just accessed this here the paris tournament and we're gonna have a look at teddy renaer but you know it's it's so it's cheap at the price so we're now at paris grand slam twenty twenty four teddy renaer final by the way super cool like you click on the draw and you can just look at any other matches go at the bottom of the finals you can go yeah to anyone any any one of them that's so cool it's really well done really well done interface anyway let me first ask the ridiculous big question who do you think is the greatest of all time stade rene rene in the writing he's the greatest judo winner of all time of that there's no doubt you know i mean he is the and i think if you asked him whether he was the greatest judo man in the world of all time he would say no i'm not you know and he's he's not the greatest judo man mhmm there are people with you know more beautiful judo in some ways although he's got great technique but he he he is the ultimate winner ten time world champ yeah two time gold medalist in the olympics i guess two time bronze medalist he's probably going is he's going to paris yeah you know he's going after it again so he's right here i mean he's right there you know this this is just a couple of months ago and then last week this last week he he was out again and he he won again you think he gets gold medal this time there's people getting closer to him right because he he's obviously you know he's age wise and the amount of time that he's been there he's obviously somebody that is starting not quite at his best as he was when he was younger but he like i say he still puts it on the line he lays it on the line every single time and then not only does he lay it on the line but he beats them all you know and last week he just beat saito who's a young up and coming japanese fighter and he beat him in the final it was close and he did well there are certain people the smaller ones actually not the taller ones because like you know we're saying about the big arm over the top that he likes and the dominant grip that he likes there are people that can give him a hard time now if at the olympic games he has two or three of those on the trot it might work against him you know and it's by no means an absolute certainty that he's gonna win the olympic gold medal but he's gotta be one of the favorites top favorite you know no matter what happens now tilly renaer is is the greatest winner that you know and if you asked the great yamashita he would say the same you know there's nobody that's you know and yamashita was unbeaten in international competition and i i trained with yamashita a lot over a two year period and got to know him quite well and he was one of the greatest of all times you know for me he was one of the greatest judo men and i'm talking about from a technical point of view from a spectacular judo point of view understanding the fundamental principles of how techniques work sometimes having different techniques that work for you you know so if one doesn't work and and one particular direction doesn't work you can change the direction completely in in case people don't know yamashita is this legendary jidoka heavyweight teddy renaer heavyweight that's plus one hundred kg so he he would've caused him all sorts of problems oh yeah that would've that's cool who do you think wins yamash yes i i think yamash would've but you know what wait wait wait wait wait you think yamashita would be steady when eric i think so strong words you think so you think so yamase is on the shorter side right yeah and he he he finds it more difficult with shorter people you know and so it it was it would have been a very interesting confrontation and if i think if you asked yamashita he would probably say you know that teddy renaer he's very gracious he's really gracious it would be really good it would have been a an unbelievable matchup and i and i've gotta say this that you know tellez renier is the greatest winner of all time competition wise so it's interesting both of them maybe you can correct me but have this osoto gari which is kinda trip that i never understood yeah like it's a it's a it's a very tricky thing to do right it's very easy to do maybe as a white belt you roll in you can understand but like to do it at the high high high level you see any of the top guys now especially if they're second time out you know so like they might catch somebody by surprise they come out they go bang oh and you go that was amazing right but if they fought again ten minutes later you go you're not gonna catch me with that right you got a different situation here and and so it's slightly different but the best fighters adapt like that and they're able to see a situation feel the situation and they attack once and then go again and attack second third time and in the third time they make it work yeah both yamase and and teddy renier with the soledagari they'll just like hit it over and over in the match yeah sometimes they'll hit first time and it won't go yeah and then you make a readjustment of the way in it's a little bit like i mean if you take a really easy way of understanding it is if we're shooting at a target and all of a sudden you start moving that target you know it's different hitting a moving target but it's also different hitting a moving target that's trying to hit you mhmm as well and that's our game right so we're we're not only trying to throw a moving target we're trying to throw a moving target that's trying to throw us so it makes it even more difficult yeah there's a there's a few folks who you know what's coming it's like over and over and over it's the same attack anyway with this uchimada it's like it's different it's it's different and there's not many people like that where it's like this the same attack i mean there's other attacks also but they'll just go after the same thing over and over and over when i watch great athletes most of them can throw over both flanks mhmm not always going left and right you know although our sport always i mean the cat is are always demonstrated left and right so like if you demonstrate if you do something on one one side you know then can you demonstrate it on the other side right okay so can you do it equally no but you do it differently right on the other side so you know when i'm teaching i don't teach left and right so if i was teaching you to do a technique first thing i'd do is say i need you to take a sleeve and a lapel mhmm alright so i'd let you decide what was left and right mhmm k because often what happens is we impart on people whether they're gonna be left or right when we start teaching you know you get a lot of teachers do that alright and they'll say immediately are you what do you write with left or right hand and it's no indicator actually as to how we do judo because i'm left handed and i do more predominantly right handed because i lead off my strongest hand mhmm and actually most people do you know so actually left and right is a bit of a trap sometimes you know when we're teaching better to get you know because we can go so my point was is that a lot of people can go both flanks so they'll do something over this side and something over this side but anyway it was one-sided he was one-sided but he could he could switch it so he had a a as well on the other side so he could switch it if he had to interesting yeah and by the way your opponent in eighty four was he righty or lefty he was a righty so that drop left yeah that to say yo where did that come from well i mean again it was you know he could have probably in other contests he'd hit me with it several times and i just stopped it and you know and just at the wrong place at the right time for him right place and the wrong time for me right that's life you know yeah alright let's let's watch some teddy over there this is final of paris tournament and this is against the corinne corinne had had a great day actually again shorter again shorter so he does find that difficult have a look at telly rene telly rene will try and catch the sleeve he's after the sleeve and then the right arm over the top that's the key point for tellez renier and of course what he what he has done if he can't always catch the big over his right hand side he's been doing something to the opposite side and the queen just went for a drop sale and the taylor mcnair block with the hips and he's like i say he has difficulty always against somebody smaller dropping with the cn aggies has teddy renier ever been thrown for ipon never seen him thrown for ipon but he was thrown last week for a nice technique and he's being caught more and more so he's getting close yeah and to say of in the final of the world championships they had a strange situation there where to say of was a was a technique down and then pulled off a a counter mhmm and they didn't count it but then they over overruled it unfortunately i was commentating at the time and i i went for a score for the for toseyev and anyway they overruled it and then they awarded a second gold medal to toseyev what can you say about tamerlan beshayev who also gave him trouble yeah beshayev and toseyev are the two that that could possibly go to the olympics so that was a close one there from renier that was closest that he'd actually been there oh wow so didn't have the sleeve and he relies on the sleeve greatly big support there in the french in the crowd and also maybe can you explain the penalties for for stalling yeah so if if they don't attack if they've got a grip and they've got sleeve lapel or they got two hands on if they're too passive and they don't attack if they've got dominant sleeve grip they don't attack that was quite close as well from the korean so the korean here you can see is having a real go you know the penalties will come if they don't attack at the right time step outside the yellow area they'll get penalized as well that that's dedication for absolutely i mean it was really close wasn't it they had a nice little kochigari there from the korean and if they touch below the belt line with the arms so so if they they're not allowed to grab the legs they've stopped grabbing the legs wow the koreans really go at koreans having a real good go at it i guess every single person in that division is probably training for tellez rene right you think that teddy renier has been there a long time you know and he he's got another guy here in the final of the paris tournament he's got eighteen thousand people watching him they're all on teddy renaer's side yeah they want him to win and the korean's out there on his own with his coach but also the pressure that on teddy renaer amazing pressure you know we we we interviewed him after this and he said i've got pressure you know people go well is he going to do it at the olympic games can i do it in paris he wanted to go to paris i mean really i mean the last olympic games should have been it shouldn't it the last should have been the final one but he's gone no i've gotta do another four years two penalties are on the board already for the korean that korean is really having a great go he's got a little a bit of a lift on him he's going after it he's really going after it you know it's a it's an amazing effort there from the korean and he's getting some last minute information i don't know if you've ever seen his coach stood next to him like that but it's amazing he's six foot six and he's he's about four foot six he's a he's a real fan full of passion i love it he's like screaming so golden score how does golden score work can you say so the golden score so if it goes without any point on the board from a throw or a hold down or arm lock strangle then it goes into golden score so two shadows on the board a piece one more mistake now and it's gonna be all over oh wow and that's it he just manages to turn it on the korean and that went really against the run of play didn't it yeah because the korean did better you know but you know teddy renee is a winner yeah and he says alright okay let's have more more cheering finds a way to to score and and i have to say you know that even when he loses you know he he's always graceful yeah he doesn't like it but he's graceful yeah there is so much love there celebration it's great it's great to see it's great that he's doing it again going after it chasing the gold medal again well he's chasing the gold medal it's gonna be in paris which is gonna be even you know more fantastic you know he's already the greatest you said you know what is he going to do to to be the greatest he's already the greatest competitor judo's ever known and that was even you know with with the great tally you know so tally was amazing as well are you part of the commentating team for prayer part of the commentating team but it won't be for ijf because it's independent broadcast have you ever had an athlete sort of come up to you and and ask like why why did you say that or like disagree with your commentary do you know what i've gotta say that ninety nine percent ninety point nine point nine percent of everybody yeah is so grateful that i've commentated their fights all the way through they know if they've messed up so if i say something and i'm never disparaging really disparaging you know but what i will say is you know it was a great throw by the other guy or it was a great match and if they made a mistake so if they walk out they know that i will say something that will you know mean something so then nobody really moans about it i'd i'd i'd try and talk the truth if i can so who else would you consider as as some of the greats so i i personally just because i love the standing seanagi koga so there's like you know the number of times you won the world championships and the olympic games but there's also like how you won and how you won into fights and what you did you know it's not necessarily about getting gold medals it's about how you fought and how you represent the sport and there are certain athletes like nua and eliadas that are going after the big throws only after they don't wanna win by ippon you know and i think that that that is the difference is they're the ones that come out there and it's a bit like you know when when tyson stepped out there you you knew what you were gonna get you know and and if they went toe to toe if if you if tyson had somebody going toe to toe somebody was gonna get knocked out and you know we got the same in judo when people go head to head and it's an open match and i often talk about an open match i say they're they're they're it's an open match they're both trying to score somebody is gonna get scored and somebody's gonna go you know and that's that makes it exciting and it's when great when they come out and they close-up you know then that's not an exciting match is there a case for for ono shohei ono three time world champ two time gold medalist i think that you know judo wise he's gotta be one of the greatest because he had such versatility he had he could go right and he could go left mhmm he could pick up he could go to the ground as well he he won a lot of his earlier matches on the ground i think his empathy you know and how he presents himself sometimes he falls down and i think that hopefully that should come with tutoring and you know of how to how to be a great champion after you know it's not just about what you do on the map but what you do off the mat as well just just to you a great champion is the whole package of yeah how how you present yourself when you lose how you yeah represent yourself just every after that i think it's how you present yourself afterwards how you are with people how much you can help people i mean people kids and you know they look up to these great champions because they wanna be like them so the worst thing is when you get somebody that's a bit of an ass and they're and they're not presenting themselves in the right way so i like to see somebody presenting themselves in the right way and i think that it's something that can be taught it's something that normally comes with a little bit of experience and a little bit of age you know and i like to think that i'm a little bit different now than i was when i was nineteen not that i was bad you know i i just think i was just you know i see it often now you know just full of full of beans you're you're a beautiful work in progress what about nomura did i hear nomura that's three time gold medalist never lost an olympic fight so there's an there's nobody right yeah no nobody ever done that you know what i mean so that that's gotta be it has to stand he took two years off yeah in between every olympic games and came back did the right amount of events to qualify for not only did he having to qualify he had to qualify through japan now japan remember have got the greatest depth so they got people coming through all the time you know and they- and then he had to win the japanese trials i mean we had a four time world champion from japan this is when world championships was every other year and this is shozou fuji and he was the greatest middleweight of all time and never got to participate in the olympics because he lost the japanese trials twice in two olympic you know possibilities so you know he had to qualify for japan and then go to the olympic games and then do it there you know so sometimes some of the best people in japan can't get outside of japan look at the situation they had with abe and then they had maruyama maruyama was you know and abe were both the best by far in the under sixty six kilos category this is for the last olympic games and they sent one to the world championships one to the olympic games and they both won gold medals you know yeah yeah i mean that's why the the all japan championships are like legendary but there's these battles with dimashita and and all of them well abe and and mariam they they had a a trials in the kodakan mhmm it was twenty twenty six minutes i think it was twenty six minutes it went they were battling it out yeah twenty six minutes that's great if we can just go to you've trained in japan what are those run doris like what what's that training like i touched on the danger the the that danger of being thrown when you get hold of somebody or somebody gets hold of you and i often reflect i often talk about it when i'm commentating you know because i can see immediately you know it's easy isn't it you know if we're in the commentary chair or if you're in the coach's chair and you don't really understand totally absolutely what's going on when you're being somebody's being outgripped and when they're in danger of being thrown i mean you know if you're in danger of being thrown the first thing you do is stick your backside out and defend by not being in the position they want you to be in alright and so that's danger you know you feel the danger and so in japan that was the place i used to go to train because i felt the danger and so my defenses would be heightened and so somebody that was i went two two years one one olympic cycle i went two years two months without having a score on me in any competition and then i went to one competition in the european championships which i won and i was struggling all the way through it and got scored on three times in my pool of you know like my first pool of fights mhmm and i was devastated i i and and i actually nearly lost the whole competition because i was more mortified about being scored on three times mhmm when i hadn't been scored on for two and a half years i had this thing in my head about two and a half years i'd go you know and and and then all of a sudden right i'm not unbeatable and then you just you and you go and i i was almost lost it completely lost it just so fortunate couple of things went my way and just came out and i scraped and scratched my way to the final and and won the final well alright but that was my best match but i almost lost it well what do you do with the fact that if you go to japan and you're getting you're saying danger like you're probably getting getting thrown getting thrown yeah japan what does that do to your ego well again it's my you know that that was a winning ego that had to adapt i remember we went to the case joe which is police dojo one time and they wanted to see the they created this the groundwork competition mhmm because they wanted to see my me do the juju like how i oh but i went in and how i yeah how the the armbar right they wanted to see how i did it from underneath or over the top and you just they created this event so decree that yeah they started it so and then winner stays on competition was happening at the case joe so i did about seven i think it was seven in and then my coach came in and said no it's finished that's it now it's finished you know suddenly we realized what was going on and i used to go in no no no no don't stop me like that you know yeah and and it was one of those moments where you know the the boot was on my foot you could say you know rather than the other side the other way because i had been to japan in situation i remember as as a sixteen year old i i got such i i got such a a drumming from one of the japanese guys older students and he had a gold tooth and so he was gold tooth to me you know and he was my nightmare and i i remember kept coming out to fight him because he kept throwing me and and i was crying and i was upset and i was like and then that was another occasion where i got dragged away and i i said no and so i wanted to go back and fight him and i went back to the same dojo every year to fight him he was on my mind mhmm morning noon night he was on my mind gold tooth was on your mind gold tooth was on my mind you know and it you're a get him two years later i i was so two years to me from sixteen to eighteen was totally different eighteen years of age i was pretty competitive with him and it was like you know i was standing up with him nineteen he was in the groundwork competition mhmm and that's when the switch happened the switch happened you know because i just i just well because i remember getting the arm lock and and it didn't put it on immediately i needed it to last it had to last sure so i i spread it the the whole thing lasted as long as i could possibly get it and it was a a long memory yeah as i was looking down at him and now and now he has nightmares about you now he has nightmares about you i wonder what nickname he has for you i don't know i i i'm hoping that he remembers me as as he has a photo of you know what he probably doesn't say just back an eyelid doesn't say a thing about it well i mean can you just speak to that training with those folks you know you said crying and then just the frustration of being thrown yeah i mean what what how do you it's such a beautiful part of the process of becoming great yeah i think i think it is just something that you're you know that doesn't happen at this level you know we were talking about levels and then at this level it it never happened and then i went out in my first european cadet and and all of a sudden i wasn't the the this top guy i was in the mix and then i had to work myself to the top of that mix and then to the top of the next one you know because i went to the european senior championships and you know again you're not the top and you know you've worked your way to the top of that and and i think it is a frustration you know but i think it's that kinda hatred of losing and and also being out of control i think that the first time first senior european championships i fought i fought nevzorov but he was only one of my contests then i had to fight frenchman for third place but he totally outgripped me and and i remember i was more upset even though i won the contest i was more upset that he totally out he did out grip me and and i was more upset and then i fought him a year later and outgripped him alright so it was it was one of those you know it was a learning process all the way through yeah that like frustration is like whatever that does to your your your soul the building up afterwards is what actually makes you better it's fascinating and do you think there's in japan just killers there that are like just the world doesn't know about they just just yeah there's world champions in the dojo you know there's people that never make it out yeah you know i remember we were training right so and everybody that's that goes to japan all my friends my that that have been world olympic champions right they all know what i'm talking about they know exactly who i'm what i'm saying is that when we go to the dojos there we all get thrown by people that never come out to be world champions you know they're they're just in the mix or they're going through three years of university and then they go we we had a guy yeah we had a guy that came in he came he was business guy he came in his suitcase and his briefcase like that he's got a tie up like that and he's so he decides he's gonna come in and he he he gets changed and he's he's in his lunch hour he's in his lunch hour right so we've gotta be quick yeah so he comes in and he goes through he's working his way through the whole of the british team we're all lined up right yeah he's just working his way through the whole of the british team and i know it's my turn next so on his left turn i try i i get hold of him and i throw him immediately and then it was what we were talking about when you it happens in the first few minutes few seconds of the the the practice so then i had four minutes of him coming at me and i'm going up into the air and i'm twisting off and i'm like like like and then like everybody's laughing at the side of the mat or the whole british team he's gone through the whole british team and then he ten minutes later he's just just tied his tie up like that you know and yeah back to work like you know imagine him sitting behind his desk and his computer yeah yeah yeah i'm glad he didn't get out hopefully he listens to this hopefully anybody else i didn't mention as part of the greats that just kinda jump in kazuizaki sensei is is the the my favorite of all favorites he is what i would call a judo genius i don't know if you can get him up here can we get him up yeah so go into nineteen eighty one world championships and and i'll talk you through the great kashiwazaki he was one year in great britain and he was he was a guy that was so much a genius alright so you want the final of the under sixty sixty five kilograms there the one at the top this is him he he is two weight categories below my weight category that i won the world championships same year i won it so this is it's not i'm not sure if this is gonna show his final of this is a highlight oh no so watch this this is this this he did in the final what in the final of the world but if he was just listening he did an incredible sacrifice throw yep and then he was on top for the for the and renowned for his groundwork and he he was on top of against a really strong romanian guy alright so his transition was just phenomenal yeah let me let me go back and look at that what what just happened so he's just showing you so he does this coaching thing just to create space wow and it's his follow through into into groundwork that is best of all and then the romanian really strong like i say he gone all the way through to the final of the world championships winning most by ippon i think the romanian and he's defending really really well here and you can see that how persistent he he knows exactly what he wants he's just gotta get his leg out now watch he'll tie the arm up mhmm and then he'll pull the top leg towards him and then he'll push the bottom one off always working with both feet always working always working readjust the balance still one leg trapped final of the world championships good referee because he's refereeing something here that's happening mhmm you know that's gonna decide as to whether so he doesn't call it to stand it up at all watch him pull the top one now and he'll push the bot bottom one there's a calmness on his face which is great to see it calm pushes the bottom leg leg out job done all finished this is him again watch this this is another technique that he does and then just again sacrifice directly in directly into the transition is everything isn't it in judo yeah you know it's well in anything really but judo is especially pays off yeah i mean because we haven't got that long i mean we had more time here they've just brought more time back so we've got more time to transition in and to get the situation that we want and and to get the attacking situation that we want because you know i remember i was teaching in america to to some jiu jitsu guys and they were saying oh we'd never give you our back mhmm and i said with judo rules certain situations it happens that you know when we try and do throws where we're facing away mhmm from our opponent you know so like for example see an aggies mhmm if they fail then the back is there you know and that's how we get the back and it's a different situation you know than going on your back in the guard situation totally different well there are travis stevens i don't know how familiar with his judo but he's a really interesting example because he competed at the highest level in jujitsu as well and his idea he's a big seanagi guy and he basically threw all that away he in the jiu jitsu in the jiu jitsu like he took the sport from scratch for what it is so his he almost never did a standing saint augustine at all in jiu jitsu no because he would leave his back all the time you know if if it failed you know what i mean but he he wouldn't have the same kind of grip on the the judogi or or the karate the jiu jitsu gi yeah a little bit different and so you have to kinda consider the sport the art of it and also the competitors the styles and the the the culture of the sport if you wanna win if winning is the most important thing then yeah you're like alright well let's you know but you you'll learn the game don't you and and that's what he did he he learned the game you know and i think that is credit to him you know and that's why i was saying about wrestling you know the wrestlers i mean we you've good to learn the judo and for what it is and the mechanics and the and how it works and then learn the wrestling i mean i i do the commentary as well for the freestyle and i will be at the olympics for the freestyle and the greco roman so and i love the freestyle absolutely love it but freestyle is freestyle judo is judo i like to see people doing judo yeah but there's a there's a rhyme to the whole combat thing they're all i mean the the body mechanics it's all like fascinating echoes of each other in interesting ways there's yeah the the details are different but there's still two humans clashing yeah we've got some amazing crossovers with people like the mongolians have come in the georgians i mean the georgians do massive pickups and different techniques and you know if you ask the fighters whether you know grabbing the legs you know a lot of them would say some of the wrestling styles you know the the georgians and the and the mongolians might say yeah i'd like to be able to take the legs but you know a lot of them just adapted you get eliadeus for example he just adapted so he thought well i'll take my arm over the top and i'll just rip them out the floor that way yeah you know what i mean did they're still doing the the big lifts they're still doing the the big ripping but they they just don't grab below the legs yeah it's weird yeah they figured it out and they figured it out like that yeah it you would think it'd take a long time no it was like a month yeah no exactly at the highest level which is crazy so you mentioned jiu jitsu a little bit what's what's used in the interesting difference between jiu jitsu and judo that you've observed because you're one of the greatest ever on the on the ground in judo and so you know jujitsu is primarily focused on similar type of stuff on the ground so what do you use an interesting difference there they have different approach different time scale to to them and they have a different way in so like where ours comes from a standing position directly in we've got a time scale on it so we we have to like the catch what i i always talk about the catch because in judo terms if you don't get the catch immediately then the referee won't see the the transition in and also the continuation from plan a b c d you know if something builds so we have to build it mhmm and we we have to build it quickly and i think in jujitsu terms you have more time to build yeah there's a there's a kind of patience like oh if this doesn't work out i could try a different thing yeah just with judo there's like an urgency like there's a better urgency every and there's a ref watching skeptically so you better show that you're making progress you've gotta show the progression and that's why you know i always had a a plan a b c you see there with you know that was nineteen eighty one there the great kashiwazaki was had had a progression you know everything was he knew exactly where he had to be it was feel you know that wasn't by accident it was it was trained and i think that that transition there and taking control of somebody's mistakes so somebody might have made a mistake or not hit properly or your defense has caused them to make a mistake and then you take advantage of it and that that is the difference so one of the side effects of that i don't know with the chicken or the egg but judo people on the ground are much more aggressive so probably because of the urgency but just like there's an intention behind the the progress you're making i think jiu jitsu is more relaxed there's more a culture of just finding places to relax and think of different control and positions and take your time and as a result it's much much less exhausting so you can go for much longer feels like judo is exhausting it's that ten second blast isn't it you know it's it's it's like doing sprints mhmm all the time you know and that is really hard and that's a special kind of condition you need and you need to be able to catch it and know when to go and when not to go and i think also i was going to ask you do you think it'd make a difference i mean certain jiu jitsu you can't just throw yourself on your back you know into the guard you have to throw into the situation you know so you have got i mean i know roger gracie he decided that he was going to learn judo he saw the importance of being able to throw for the transition in and so he came to the buddhi and he was learning off ray stevens and you know they were they were doing really a lot yeah well he's a fascinating study because he does the most basic stuff and he does the but just it well like we did like what another level of well it's like yamashita everyone knows what's what's coming with haja gracie but he just does it anyway i guess the best people in the world is crazy he's like everybody in jujitsu at at white belt learns the techniques he's using and he just does it amazing isn't that yeah but he has about a thousand ways in yeah yeah i mean and in the the thousand ways there's in the details so it kinda might even look the same to people but there's i mean he finds a way to choke people so he's on top of them mounted yeah in a sort of judo pin position and you know everyone knows what's coming next against the best people in the world and you should be able to defend it but nobody can't it's crazy i think there there's the power element as well you know that that you don't realize how you know when somebody's directed in a particular way then you have that kind of element of of absolute power you can only feel like like when roger's doing a technique i think that you would only feel it if he did it on you you know then then you can feel it it's not something that happens you know like so tricks is one thing but actually being able to do something really well from a powerpoint of view you know it's like like you say mhmm he's he's only does those few things but he does them really really really well yeah i don't know what that is about actually judo pins is a very interesting case study as well because people are able to feel so heavy one of the things judoka are able to do is pin extremely well yeah okay and it makes you realize that it's not about the weight it's about some kinda technique that makes people feel like they weigh a a thousand pounds it's about it's about weight distribution yeah and change of balance you know a lot of people don't realise that there's huge changes of balance on the ground massive you know you know what it's like i mean you you know you're a jujitsu man and and you know the detail of the techniques is what really interests me you know i mean i'm always looking small ideas you know i'm always looking at the jiu jitsu and i just it fascinates me you know i would have done jujitsu for sure but i wouldn't have forgotten the the judo way in to the techniques you know what i mean i think that you've got to differentiate the two but i would have i would have loved the jiu jitsu i would have absolutely loved it you know but it wasn't as prominent then you know where the neewasser came from it came from a mistake me getting beaten in a particular contest and i went i'm not gonna be beaten again on the ground that's that's how it happened yeah well yeah the story of your life is like a loss creates the phoenix rises well it it just it was nineteen seventy eight and it was it was you know it wasn't a mistake it was a a particular movement and i was fighting weight up mhmm from what my normal weight but i'm i stayed in the same position for one second too long got caught and choked sengaku yeah triangle triangle triangle wow and i i said i literally just the same as i said to you when i said i'm not gonna drink anymore i came off and i said i'm not never gonna get caught on the ground yeah never gonna lose on the ground ever and i never lost in in my whole competitive career again wow but yeah i i i i should mention that there's nothing like a pin from a from a judo person i don't actually know if people in jujitsu have made sense of that like loaded that in but it's not part of it's not part of the game is it you know it it the pin its submission yeah but you know control is part of the game right and nobody controls a human body the way judo people do on the ground like they have understood the science of control and i think that's control is extremely useful in jiu jitsu as well it's just that people don't because there's so many other domains of exploration but the the interesting i mean just oh oh and i'm and especially when you apply jiu jitsu to the fighting setting so mixed martial arts that control that side control that pin control is really really really important so but then you add punching to the thing and it becomes that puts a whole different thing on it doesn't it i mean there's an alternate history where you would have been part of the early ufcs if time was a little different you know maybe a a few years later because your your your style of judo and jujitsu and the and the transitions and the aggression and the all of that would have worked really well in the early ufcs i'm sure i was being set up at one stage by one of the graces and that was when when he was winning all the matches yeah but he came in with with a couple of the cousins to one of my seminars nice yeah and he was one of the first ones wasn't he that that that's how i loved to see the kind of ufc because it was different martial arts different skills and you know i mean he he'd get close and he'd just choke them out or arm lock them or you know arm bar them and that was that was brilliant you know that was for me that was a revelation that was how i saw it yeah it's a fascinating science experiment which aspects of different martial arts work well and not when they clash together and it it did turn out that neuasa worked well the key yeah it was the key wasn't it yeah yeah it was a it was a big missing link in our conception of fighting it's the neutralizer of size and a lot of other components and it just blew people's mind that like okay it's not just about size it's not just about big big guys swinging hands it's it's a lot of other components and and the groundwork is really really important and of course there's a few judoka that succeeded in the ufc since then which is always interesting how they adapt to the you know when you take off the gi how can you still throw people how can you still do control how can you still take advantage of the transition on the ground ronda rousey is a good example of somebody that took advantage of that yeah i think one of the biggest things for the judo curve is we've never struck you know there's no strikes and i think that's the biggest shock if you wish you know when you get one yeah punched in the face you get punched in the face and you're not used to that that's not what we're used to some people are able to get punched in the face better than others yeah for sure then again there's ron grossi who doesn't need to get punched in the face he just gets in close throws a person in an armbar right there yeah and kayla you know kayla and kayla as well kayla harrison that's another incredible person she could have probably been just winning olympic gold medal after olympic gold medal but chose to whatever you know she decides i mean rhonda as well you know whatever they decided to do they're they're great athletes they hate losing i i don't know anybody that hates losing more than those two you know they don't like it and kayla harrison like i don't know anybody that works as hard as her that's a crazy crazy crazy work ethic well let me ask you about training again jimmy pedro said he learned a lot from you he learned how to do tai toshi the armbar digit autonomy but he also learned from you training methodology so what's he talking about he told me about this what what what what's your approach to training throughout your career and has it developed i always wanted to train harder than anybody else i still train now every day if if i don't train do something i do do an hour of of my physical work and i still go on the mat a little bit you know i'm sixty five now and so i'm not doing really heavy stuff on the mat but i still like to train and when i was twenty one twenty up to thirty i was one of the best trainers but you know jimmy pedro was one of the best trainers as well he's one of your dream athletes you know when jimmy pedro steps through your door and he was just a kid you know he was like he was just young when he stepped through my door and i had a lot of full time trainers so i had up to twenty really good athletes that were training hard and i only wanted hard trainers give me ten that train hard rather than your one prima donna that you know your skillful you know the one that that you know could do any i i just i wanted ten you know or twenty really hard trainers because you can do so much with them you can make champions you can make them world champions you know if you've got somebody that was a special talent and they wanted to work hard then you had a special athlete well when you say hard trainers what what do you mean are these people that just like every single day are able to just grind it out do it around dory do the training do the the boring things just keep coming back yeah when the going gets tough you know and and i i think that that was him he had a special mentality and you know and the thing is you see when you've got him in your dojo alright even when you're tired when somebody's tired and when you know what an example to the others so he'd pull the other ones in as well you know so i so i i had somebody that when everybody was tired and everybody was sick of it and everybody just wanted to you know and he'd still be there you know so they had to do it so that was for me a win win you know so he he i had all the americans actually i had i had bobby berlin and i had michael swain and i had ed liddy and i had i had them all coming to visit me at different times jimmy was there you know they they wanted to be the best in the end we had such a a great club atmosphere they wanted to come for for for the hard work mhmm and they knew that if they came they were gonna be dragged out and we were gonna do physical training and it was physical training like they hadn't done before but it wasn't just the physical training it was the judo and and the and the skill side of it as well and so i always had a great empathy with the us team olympic team so a lot of your olympic medalists have been through with me you know and so i'm i'm proud of that because we had you know some great times and they're still great mates now and and so in new york in a couple of weeks' time i'm gonna have everybody is gonna be there they're all coming in all old friends all old friends and new friends so what what what's a tough week look like at your peak physical training randory is there days off are you training like twice a day twice a day so we do the preparation training we do the running we do the weight training we do the skills in the morning as well the skills is for me one of the biggest advantages that any full time trainers can have because what happens is is that with most clubs you're trying to fit everything into that hour and a half or two hours you know you fit your skills you fit your your physical training and your your sparring and your you know everything's in there all grouped in so the biggest advantages of having a full time group is that you can split your skills and your skills lay your foundation so the biggest advantage is being able to work specifically on things without having to worry about getting to do your you know your randory or your sparring or then you've got to go out for you just do the skills well when you talk about skills like what is say your specialty is a tai tauchi what are are we talking about uchi komi doing a bunch of phys are they working with bands are you doing throws are you actually just having conversations about like specific like tiny details of throws like what what does skills mean all those things about doing your repetition practice making sure the repetition's correct you know there's good repetition so when we say good repetition does it would you call me when you're just fitting the throw versus doing the throw where do you land on the value of it i'm getting it moving you know so one of the biggest most important things is getting it moving if we do something static again it's that static target you need to get it moving so you need to do repetition and also you need to do a correct repetition because if you're doing a hundred repetitions that are not correct and repetitions under pressure too much pressure without somebody overseeing those skills to make sure that the that you correct the skills because if you're doing a skill if you're doing it ninety nine times incorrectly alright then repetition doesn't make perfect repetition makes permanent so you're gonna make it as per as perfect as you possibly can so actually that skills group there is the most important thing and what i used to do is oversee it so i'd oversee it to make sure that it was done properly so you're watching the the footwork you're watching the gripping and just constantly adjusting how people i give you an example jimmy pedro jimmy was one of the hardest when he was nineteen years of age right so i was always asking me to practice always so he's always on me all the time so i do groundwork with him and could i put him on his back no i was all on him and he'll tell you you know but he was just wouldn't go he was just he was gonna be great without a doubt alright so i wanted everybody on with him everybody so everybody went on with him you know and and so it only improved their game and it improved him and then with you know small technical things that have stayed with him that we were doing with the jujiketami that was passed on to kayla and then gone on you know to rhonda and it's all small things that i can see sometimes that you know it's passed on what about the tayatoshi he said he learned a lot from you from that throat and he does it differently and so i should mention that's one of the trickier throat i mean i don't i still don't understand it is a tricky throat i don't understand so for people who don't know it it it boy how would you even explain it it doesn't make any sense it's when you just look solo the the movement you make is very is quite simple but how you get person to be off balance how you yeah actually get them to be thrown and when you do throw it successfully it looks like a whipping motion that's effortless it makes no sense it makes no sense other than it's every technique starts with the hands yeah so it's what we call kuzushi and you know you're pulling somebody off balance getting them moving pulling them off balance taiatoshi means body drop so it's basically two legs across your partner's body i've got my back to you alright and i've already pulled you off balance with my hands and then i'm gonna just flex my legs up just as you're coming onto my back and and then you're gonna go over you know if i coordinate it alright if it's if it doesn't get coordinated right then you're gonna come right on my back and try to rip my arm off you know so yeah i gotta get it right what was if you can put convert it to words some secret ingredients that allowed you to pull it off at the highest levels the tatosha the hands start every technique so getting the repetition right first of all so you need to get the repetition right you need a good partner so actually training your partner to react in the right way is just as important as learning the throw so actually what happens is you know i we could get a lesson of beginners we teach the throw and then go right off you go and ninety percent of them will get it wrong because their partner's not reacting in the right way so half of it is to get the person to react as they should so if i was doing it with you you and i first thing i teach you to do is to react the way i want you to react and then i'd react the way that you want me to react alright so then we'd have success with it rather than you leaning back in the wrong way or resisting or frightened you're going over so you know so actually that's why nine times out of ten people get the technique wrong it's actually fascinating to me because in the united states where i came up judo i mean the level of judo is not comparable to the level of judo in the rest of the world of course the the pedro center is an exception to that so certain athletes yeah it's just certain athletes like when i when i trained recently with with jimmy pedro it's like even like the the sixteen year old kids are just all deadly so it was terrifying but you know i remember the russian national team came through philadelphia and one of the things that really impressed me is just how much easier judo was training judo with them they moved correctly as like u k as the people getting thrown every aspect of their body movement was correct in terms of it felt right to be throwing them to be training with them everything about the gripping about the position of their hips about the shoulder everything it was it was fun it was easy and like and i always felt like i was learning so i think all of that is loaded in i guess into proper training so you're developing through the throws you're developing the right type of yeah you have to develop between you know i always had training partners that i trained with up to each olympic games and we we worked together for the we did the skills together and then we you know we we worked together in in order to make techniques work and we got it moving as quickly as we could and one of the worst things i see is and i see a lot of youtube stuff with coaches here we go ah okay don't even start me on that don't even start me on that but you know what what you're laughing because you know what i'm talking about okay i'm actually laughing because i'm enjoying you talking trash but but yeah you talk about technique yeah just well you know the the you know the coaches and their clipboard guys you know with the clipboards and the stopwatches and you know they got these kids running up and down the mat and and then doing uchikomi of of something that's technically incorrect you know ten times and then running up and doing another ten at the other side you know and actually mixing everything together and it's just a mess you know techniques just technical mess that said some of it is conditioning type stuff that you were doing so what what what is like the hardest type of physical conditioning you were doing probably ran too much you know when i was a when i was a kid if i could go back now i wouldn't run as much and i ran hard and i ran strong and i remember doing london marathon one time and i said i'm never gonna do it again i said never and then but i ran you know and i i i was trying to the problem was when i did the london marathon is i was trying to beat three hours it's a desire to win again insane you know it was insane yeah and i went out through half marathon in what i thought was a good time anyway i got to sixteen seventeen miles and totally blew and i'll say you went out too fast yeah i went out too fast and then you just i died keep going absolutely just i died lex i i i got in i i crossed the line i still remember seeing this bridge over there right and the the bridge it was the finishing line over the bridge and i had to get there it was the longest bridge i've ever yeah ever walked over and i walk run like so i got over the bridge and i took one step over the the the line like that and there was a guy over there and he was trying to rush everybody through you know and he was going come on come on come on there's people behind you get your hands off me i said i said fuck yeah get your hands off me now like that because we're gonna fall out you know and and i couldn't move i i i couldn't move i was white and it was amazing that you made it to the yeah finish line though i did i got i got over there and you know i'd yeah donald duck passing me was was a was a tell oh there's a person who addresses donald duck donald duck yeah but the thing was i still crossed over three thirty eight i crossed over three thirty eight but i lost thirty eight minutes in the last four miles to that bridge longest bridge ever longest do you see your regret the running so anyway i i would do the running a little bit differently but we ran we ran hard we did the weight training we did good weight training it was all conditioned so i mean it was never the same training all the time so it was always we'd have certain phases building up it was scientifically done it wasn't just out there run weight training judo same judo all the time it was always pretty scientific good variety it was a good variety and it had build up and it had a speed phase and it had a power phase and it had you know a a like a base condition what about the randori was there a a a a method to the madness there how much randori did you do a lot so the most important thing for me i mean i see now that there's a lot of people out there that are not getting enough rendering they're not rendering enough and there's a lot of sports science people and they're running and they're weight training and they're doing it all to death and there's not enough judo and the only ones you know like you have a look at some of the the eastern bloc countries that are are getting together they're having these mass camps and the japanese they have you know just massive people that they can do they're they're doing probably fifty sixty randas a week wait what fifty or sixty a week wow the average person is getting together i mean when i was doing randaras when i went to japan it was just purely for sixty randaries a week how much is each one how long is it so they were five minutes then they're four minutes now but that's a lot especially given the level of the the competition there well you can do it in japan because it's fairly light if they throw you they throw you you throw them so there's like a level of like you're moving at a like a close to a hundred percent but the actual power in the force is not quite different in korea korea was harder it was more physical so you couldn't do fifty randers in in korea you'd die yeah so you'd do thirty wow but you need you need the randari and so i chased the randoras so i chased them into training camps i traced them all over my country so i i was getting forty to fifty a week in my club and then i would go to training camps and add more and i honestly don't think that they do enough now a lot of countries somebody who doesn't know randori is live training so yes sparring was there a few people you remember that were just like really tough to go against you mentioned goldtooth is there others like it goldtooth was pretty horrific yeah he was oh you got him in the end pretty alright i got him in the end yeah and yeah is there like i i just placed i i suppose i should say not just tough but just good training partners that you like great training partners i remember when nishida and nishida was i mentioned him earlier said he was one of the best i mean he was just such a great technician so i i would go there to his dojo and he'd ask me to practice practice and he'd always finish the practice and you know that he would always say another one we'll do another one right so you'd go oh yeah because you had to make out that you weren't that bothered that you had to do another one so you do another one back to back and then he goes sometimes let's do do another one so he'd end up doing fifteen minutes with the same guy who could possibly throw you at any time you know and and that was hard you know so but i remember those particular guys and there were plenty of those what do you do with the exhaustion that you're feeling in those like how how deep did you go in terms of flight yeah deep deep and i i think that that was the great thing about having certain like european training camps were more physical so i remember you know that we would have european training camps where you'd fight germans and then the dutch and then the french and then you know the russian or the you'd have all sorts of different styles and people there to fight and that that was something then you you'd have to dig in at a different place come out of there where where do you go mentally when you you know how many times have you gone there where like you're really in deep waters exhaustion wise in in competition actually competition it's happened you know so sometimes you go past where your forearms are absolutely blown i remember the final of czech tournament that we had and fought a frenchman in the final and my forearms were so blown i couldn't shake his hand mhmm you know and then i remember they were they were solid absolutely solid and they had lactic acid in them and and i remember i just stood on the roster on this and and they were giving me things and i couldn't grip them properly so i was saying put it under my armpit or you know chin like that i was trying to hold this and i couldn't hold anything you know and so there there are times when i really had to go really deep i remember fighting two east germans the same day one of the competitions and the number one and the number two east germans and that was another day where i had to really dig deep that's the the fascinating thing about some of these tournaments is you if you get if you go full distance on several matches in a row the way you're seeing in the finals are two people that have like fought a lot that day yeah and we have golden score now you know so we we see a lot of guys you know that going into golden score and they've done one contest in four minutes and then they go another four minutes and then you know we've had some go into a third four minutes this is all back to back it might be in the first round it might be in the final you know and we've got some now that are coming out and you can see the stats and they're the the ones that winning golden score so we got japanese hashimoto he's the japanese representative for now instead of ono because ono's finished mhmm so hashimoto's coming out he was in a tournament last week is there any way you want to look up yeah just have a look at him so hashimoto's in white here alright and there's a great example there well i'm glad we got onto that you know so i mean he has got great technique hashimoto effortless there's the tire pressure alright so you can see exactly what we're talking about that great timing and again you know sometimes he backs them up to the edge uh-huh and then he'll wait for them to come back in towards they don't wanna step out to get a penalty i guess that's a cross grip title should i see that wrong yeah cross grip different grips yeah oh great examples there just just what we were talking about making it look so easy wow so he's gonna be their representative at seventy three kilograms looking and backing him up again mhmm and again just catching him as as he pushes back so push push push and then yep action reaction at his best there yeah and that slight change of direction he sometimes goes down onto his knee there which is it turns from which is springing up to that's going down oh the the title of the video is his hitoshi is a work of art yeah this is him at his best showing him doing what he does best but he had to go three times into golden score last week and dig deep and lost one of them i think but you're still going at it you're talking about all those training sessions i'd nikki your wonderful wife told me that you were looking you were going all over like from target to target looking for workout clothes because your luggage got lost because you had to get a workout in yeah just i've you know what i just i i realized that if i'm a miserable git right then she'll get me to she'll get me into the gym you know so and and the thing is is that i'm better if i get in there for an hour and i just do something at least thirty thirty five to forty minutes cardio and then i do some weights and more high repetitions it's not so much heavy weights now but got it more functional stuff i mean you travel all over the world for for for for the commentary of these competitions so you're is it is it sometimes a challenge to figure out how well you know we're during covid then they closed all the gyms but we were still going out we were some one of the first ones out they've the judo were some of the first out the competitions were behind closed doors mhmm so we were in the hotel the gym was closed so we couldn't use the gyms so we had to look for other ways that we could work out so most of the hotels that we were in were high rise hotels so we were in the steps we were doing the steps right the way up you know so i started it and and so i started off with me going up and then one or two of the others and the referee started to go up with me and so in the end we'd have this trail of people going up the steps and down and every place we went to we had the steps so yeah that was an interesting situation so we were sick of steps in the end what advice would you give to beginners people starting out in judo how to how to develop their game how to find the beauty in in the sport and the art of judo if you put ten people in a room and said right get on with it yeah you'd have mayhem right and i think that wherever whatever sport you're doing you need good instruction good teaching and a good club atmosphere you know some somewhere that's not so intense that winning is the the the only thing and i think that if you look at ninety percent of the people that practice martial arts are doing it for pleasure so they wanna get pleasure so you you need a club that's got a bit of a mixture you know they've got a a direction to go into competition if they want and and then the rest is for fun and and to enjoy it but with really good instruction because with really good instruction and a good foundation and a good base you get more enjoyment because you're more you know you you you have more success and let's be honest you know the more success we have with something the more we like it yeah and great technique is a way to really discover the beauty of the art and so great teaching is really important there great teaching is so important what about what what does it take to get from the early days when you started judo to to world class level i think that with most i mean you do hear don't you you know if somebody's been doing judo for eight years and then they're in and i think it happened one of the french chimayo she went to the olympic games in two thousand and twelve and she'd been doing judo for eight years but then she started to lose you know so she had a relative success early on the olympics was one of them she got a silver medal but then she went off the boil and then she came back and now she's been there for she's still competing and she's been there for well over thirteen years at the very top so i think that you know any foundation is like anything if if you lay a really solid foundation generally it lasts longer yeah well that that foundation again is that technique or is there what what does it take to build that foundation i think technique you get away with murder you know you know you you you yeah with technique you can get away with you know having bad condition you know but i mean you get found out in the end but you can you know you can go out and you can win certain things by doing really nice technique but i think if you've got the mixture if you've got the whole package then you can you know go the whole way so for people who somehow don't know you've commentated some of the greatest judo matches ever you've done grand prix you've done all of these events olympics squad championship everything so what what just looking at the history of judo what like stands out to you what events stand out to you what are some good memories that popped your head i think you know some of the paris tournaments are amazing because the crowd they're there you know they're on the mat they're they're all judoka they're all they're well educated to the sport every time somebody twitches you know they're they're very biased towards their own which is kind of you expect but you know sometimes i haven't been able to hear myself speak and that's very unusual you know you've got the headphones on and you're you're blocked out you know it's like sometimes tellez renier has been walking out there and the crowd are going crazy and the and they're on their feet you know when somebody twitches and you know and and then you get this the the crowd silences we had one of those last week you know everybody's cheering their man and then bang their man goes over yeah and then there's silence silence nothing like that and then of course we were we were connotating we would go that was a bit of a crowd silencer you know but yeah that happens yeah that that is a surprising thing that at least it was to me that paris and france is really big on judo massive you know and and there's always surprises you know the the it's like paris is great in japan for the olympic games the biggest surprise was ono getting beaten in the team event now ono is the greatest judo man pound for pound probably one of the best and he won the olympic title and then they went into the team event against france and ono lost to a not he's not run of the mill german but the german you know he wasn't certainly olympic title isk and be owner yeah well the team the the team stuff is fascinating right fascinating it changes the dynamics of the whole thing yeah and it's i mean it's it's funny you say paris it it really makes it really big deal that this olympics is being held in paris like this is gonna be fast they'll be the team to beat french team because they have the best balance of the weight categories they have the best balance with their people that are world and olympic champions and qualified men and women so three three men three women they have the best balance out of anybody educated audience educated audience home grounds it's gonna be awesome it's gonna be super fun it will be super fun you nervous yeah alright do you get nervous okay i get nervous i get nervous wow i get really nervous right now but you know given especially because it's the olympics and you don't want to you want to celebrate people properly right and it's like it's everything for them yeah and a lot of people especially like the finals matches yeah you know it'll be watched you know millions of times the highest of stakes all of this played over and over yeah and i find that you know with mine i'm i'm now a little bit more careful you know with like so i'll celebrate a massive throw and then be have a empathy to the one that's been thrown you know because yeah it's not the best feeling in the world especially in olympic finals yeah can you imagine that yeah must be terrible must be terrible yeah just reflecting so i no i i have a bit of empathy there and i just i try and say the right things because they always do come up to me and say you commentated my fights yeah you're the voice of the biggest triumphs and the biggest tragedies for these athletes for the world that watches and admires these athletes no pressure you're the voice don't screw it up mia don't screw it up your voice is in my head when i watch these you know it's it's it's it's fascinating it's fascinating but you're you're a master of it it's it's a huge honor that you would talk with me thank you for everything you've done for the sport of judo for the olympics for just sports in general just celebrating greatness in all of its forms thank you for talking today keep going i can't wait to listen to you in paris thank you for having me and it's just been an honor to to be here with you thanks for listening to this conversation with neil adams to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from
