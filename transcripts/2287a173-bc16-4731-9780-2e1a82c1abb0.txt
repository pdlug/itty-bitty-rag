the following is a conversation with george hotz his third time on this podcast he's the founder of comma ai that seeks to solve autonomous driving and is the founder of a new company called tinycorp that created tiny grad a neural network framework that is extremely simple with a goal of making it run on any device by any human easily and efficiently as you know george also did a large number of fun and amazing things from hacking the iphone to recently joining twitter for a bit as a intern in quotes making the case for refactoring the twitter code base in general he's a fascinating engineer and human being and one of my favorite people to talk to and now a quick few second mention of his sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this podcast we got numerai for the world's hardest data science tournament babble for learning new languages netsuite for business management software insighttracker for blood paneling and ag one for my daily multivitamin choose wisely my friends also if you want to work on our team we're always hiring go to lex friedman dot com slash hiring and now onto the full ad reads as always no ads in the middle i try to make this interesting but if you must skip them friends please still check out our sponsors i enjoy their stuff maybe you will too this episode is brought to you by numerai a hedge fund that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to make investment decisions they created a tournament that challenges data scientists to build best predictive models for financial markets it's basically just a really really difficult real world dataset to test out your ideas for how to build machine learning models i think this is a great educational platform i think this is a great way to explore to learn about machine learning to really test yourself on real world data with consequences no financial background is needed the models are scored based on how well they perform on unseen data and the top performers receive a share of the tournament's prize pool head over to numerai slash lex that's n u m e r dot a i slash lex to sign up for a tournament and hone your machine learning skills that's numerai slash lex for a chance to play against me and win the share of the tournament's prize pool that's numerai slash lex this show is also brought to you by babbel an app and website that gets you speaking in a new language within weeks i have been using it to learn a few languages spanish to review russian to practice russian to revisit russian from a different perspective because that becomes more and more relevant for some of the previous conversations i've had and some upcoming conversations i have it really is fascinating how much another language knowing another language even to a degree where you can just have little bits and pieces of a conversation can really unlock an experience in another part of the world when you travel in france and paris just having a few words at your disposal a few phrases it begins to really open you up to strange fascinating new experiences that ultimately at least to me teach me that we're all the same we have to first see our differences to realize those differences are grounded in a basic humanity and that experience that we're all very different and yet at the core the same i think travel with the aid of language really helps unlock you can get fifty five percent off your babble subscription at babble dot com slash lex pod that's spelled b a b b e l dot com slash lex pod rules and restrictions apply this show is also brought to you by netsuite an all in one cloud business management system they manage all the messy stuff that is required to run a business the financials the human resources the inventory if you do that kind of thing ecommerce all that stuff all the business related details i know how stressed i am about everything that's required to run a team to run a business that evolves much more than just ideas and designs and engineering and evolves all the management of human beings all the complexities of that the financials all of it and so you should be using the best tools for the job i sometimes wonder if i have it in me mentally and skill wise to be a part of running a large company i think like with a lot of things in life it's one of those things you shouldn't wonder too much about you should either do or not do but again using the best tools for the job is required here you can start now with a no payment or interest for six months go to net suite dot com slash lex to access their one of a kind financing program that's net suite dot com slash lex this show is also brought to you by insidetracker a service i use to track biological data data that comes from my body to predict to tell me what i should do with my lifestyle my diet what's working and what's not working it's obvious all the exciting breakthroughs that are happening with transformers with large language models even with diffusion all of that is obvious that with raw data with huge amounts of raw data fine tuned to the individual would really reveal to us the signal in all the noise of biology i feel like that's on the horizon the kinds of leaps in development that we saw in language and now more and more visual data i feel like biological data is around the corner unlocking what's there in this multi hierarchical distributed system that is our biology what is it telling us what is the secrets it holds what is the thing that it's missing that could be aided simple lifestyle changes simple diet changes simple changes in all kinds of things that are controllable by individual human being i can't wait till that's a possibility and insidetracker is taking steps towards that get special savings for a limited time when you go to inside tracker dot com slash lex this show is also brought to you by athletic greens that's now called ag one it has the ag one drink i drink it twice a day at the very least it's an all in one daily drink to support better health and peak performance i drink it cold it's refreshing it's grounding it helps me reconnect with the basics the nutritional basics that makes this whole machine that is our human body run all the crazy mental stuff i do for work the physical challenges everything the highs and lows of life itself all of that is somehow made better knowing that at least you got your nutrition in check at least you're getting enough sleep at least you're doing the basics at least you're doing the exercise once you get those basics in place i think you can do some quite difficult things in life but anyway beyond all that it's just a source of happiness and and a kind of a feeling of home the feeling that comes from returning to the habit time and time again anyway they'll give you one month supply of fish oil when you sign up at drink a g one dot com slash lex this is a lex fridman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's george hotz you mentioned something in a stream about the philosophical nature of time so let's start with a wild question do you think time is an illusion you know i sell phone calls to comma for a thousand dollars and some guy called me and like you know it's a thousand dollars you can talk to me for for half an hour and he's like yeah okay so like time doesn't exist and i really wanted to share this with you i'm like oh what do you mean time doesn't exist right like i think time is a useful model whether it exists or not right like does quantum physics exist well it doesn't matter it's about whether it's a useful model to describe reality is time maybe compressive do you think there is an objective reality or is everything just useful models like underneath it all is there an actual thing that we're constructing models for i don't know i was hoping you would know i don't think it matters i mean this kind of connects to the models of constructive reality with machine learning right sure like is it just nice to have useful approximations of the world such that we can do something with it so there are things that are real columnagraph complexity is real yeah yeah the compressive thing math is real yeah should be a t shirt and i think hard things are actually hard i don't think p equals np oh strong words well i think that's the majority i do think factoring is in p but i don't think you're the person that follows the majority in all walks of life so but it's good for that for that one i do yeah in theoretical computer science you you're you're one of the sheep alright but do you time is a useful model sure what were you talking about on the stream with time are you made of time if i remembered half the things i said on stream someday someone's gonna make a model of all of it and it's gonna come back to haunt me someday soon yeah probably would that be exciting to you or sad that there's a george hotz model i mean the question is when the george hotz model is better than george hotz like i am declining and the model is growing what is the metric by which you measure better or worse in that if you're competing with yourself maybe you can just play a game where you have the george hot's answer and the george hot's model answer and ask which people prefer people close to you or strangers either one it will hurt more when it's people close to me but both will be overtaken by the george hot's model it'd be quite painful right loved ones family members would rather have the model over for thanksgiving than you yeah or like significant others would rather with the with the large language model version of you especially when it's fine tuned to their preferences yeah well that's what we're doing in a relationship right we're just fine tuning ourselves but we're inefficient with it because we're selfish and greedy and so on our language models can fine tune more efficiently more selflessly there's a star trek voyager episode where you know catherine janeway lost in the delta quadrant makes herself a lover on the holodeck mhmm and the lover falls asleep on her arm and he snores a little bit and you know janeway edits the program to remove that and then of course the realization is wait this person's terrible it is actually all their nuances and quirks and slight annoyances that that make this relationship worthwhile but i don't think we're gonna realize that until it's too late well i think a large language model could incorporate the the flaws and the quirks and all that kind of stuff just the perfect amount of quirks and flaw flaws to make you charming without crossing the line yeah yeah and that's probably a good like approximation of the like the percent of time the language model should be cranky or an asshole yeah or jealous or all this kind of stuff and of course it can and it will but all that difficulty at that point is artificial there's no more real difficulty okay what's the difference between real and artificial artificial difficulty is difficulty that's like constructed or could be turned off with a knob mhmm real difficulty is like you're in the woods and you gotta survive so if something cannot be turned off with a knob it's real yeah i think so or i mean you can't get out of this by smashing the knob with a hammer i mean maybe you kind of can you know into the wild when you know alexander supertramp he wants to explore something that's never been explored before but it's the nineties everything's been explored so he's like well i'm just not gonna bring a map yeah i mean no you're you're not exploring you should have brought a map dude you died there was a bridge a mile from where you were camping how does that connect to the metaphor of the knob by not bringing the map you didn't become an explorer you just smashed the thing yeah yeah the art the difficulty is still artificial you failed before you started what if we just don't have access to the knob well that maybe is even scarier right like we already exist in a world of nature and nature has been fine tuned over billions of years yeah to have humans build something and then throw the knob away in some grand romantic gesture is horrifying do you think of us humans as individuals that are like born and die or is it are we just all part of one living organism that is earth that is nature i don't think there's a clear line there i think it's all kinda just fuzzy i don't know i mean i don't think i'm conscious i don't think i'm anything i think i'm just a computer program so it's all computation everything running in your head is just a is not is is computation everything running in the universe is computation i think i believe the extended church time thesis yeah but it there seems to be an embodiment to your particular computation like there's a consistency well yeah but i mean models have consistency too yeah models that have been rlhf will continually say you know like well how do i murder ethnic minorities oh well i can't let you do that hal there's a consistency to that behavior it's all rlhf like we are rlhf each other we we find we provide human feedback in there that thereby fine tune these little pockets computation but it's still unclear why that pocket of computation stays with you like for years it just kind of fall like you have this consistent set of physics biology what like whatever you call the the neurons firing the the electrical signals and mechanical signals all of that that seems to stay there and it contains information it stores information and that information permeates through time and stays with you there's like memory it's like sticky okay to be fair like a lot of the models we're building today are very even rlhf is nowhere near as complex as the human loss function reinforcement learning with human feedback you know when i talked about will gpt twelve be agi my answer is no of of course not i mean cross entropy loss is never gonna get you there you need probably rl in fancy environments in order to get something that would be considered like agi like so to ask like the question about like why i don't know like it's just some quirk of evolution right i don't think there's anything particularly special about where i ended up where humans ended up it's okay we have human level intelligence would you call that agi whatever we have it's gi look i actually i i don't really even like the word agi but general intelligence is defined to be whatever humans have okay so why can gpt twelve not get us to agi can we just like linger on that if your loss function is categorical cross entropy if your loss function is just try to maximize compression i have a soundcloud i rap and i tried to get chat gpt to help me write raps mhmm and the raps that it wrote sounded like youtube comment raps you know you can go on any rap beat online and you can see what people put in the comments and it's the most like mid quality rap you can find is mid good or bad mid is bad mid is bad it's like mid it's like every time i talk to you i learn new words mid mid yeah i was like i is it is it like basic is that what mid means kind of it's like it's like middle of the curve right yeah so there's like there's like a like see that intelligence curve yeah where and you have like the dumb guy the smart guy and then the mid guy actually being the mid guy is the worst the smart guy is like i put all my money in bitcoin the mid guy is like you can't put money in bitcoin it's not real money and all of it is a genius meme that's another interesting one memes the humor the idea the absurdity encapsulated in a single image and it just kinda propagates virally between all of our brains i didn't get much sleep last night so i'm very i sound like i'm high i swear i'm not do you think we have ideas or ideas have us i think that we're gonna get super scary memes once the ais actually are superhuman oh we think the ai will generate memes of course you think it'll make humans laugh i think it's worse than that so infinite jest i've introduced in the first fifty pages is about a tape that you once you watch it once you only ever wanna watch that tape in fact you wanna watch the tape so much that someone says okay here's a hacksaw cut off your pinky and then i'll let you watch the tape again and you'll do it so we're actually gonna build that i think but it's not gonna be one static tape i think the human brain is too complex to be stuck in one static tape like that if you look at like ant brains maybe they can be stuck on a static tape but we're going to build that using generative models we're going to build the tiktok that you actually can't look away from so tiktok is already pretty close there but the generation is done by humans yeah the algorithm is just doing their recommendation but if it's if the algorithm is also able to do the generation well it's a question about how much intelligence is behind it right mhmm so the content is being generated by let's say one humanity worth of intelligence and you can quantify a humanity right that's a you know it's it's exaflops yada flops but you can quantify it once that generation is being done by a hundred humanities you're done so it's actually scale that's the problem but also speed yeah and what if it's sort of manipulating the very limited human dopamine engine for porn imagine just tiktok but for porn yeah that's like a brave new world i don't even know what it'll look like right like again you can imagine the behaviors of something smarter than you but a super intelligent and and and and agent that just dominates your intelligence so much will be able to completely manipulate you is it possible that it won't really manipulate it'll just move past us it'll just kinda exist the way water exists or the air exists you see and that's the whole ai safety thing it's not the machine that's gonna do that it's other humans using the machine that are gonna do that to you yeah because the machine is not interested in hurting humans it's just the machine is a machine yeah but the human gets the machine and there's a lot of humans out there very interested in manipulating you well let me bring up eliezer yatkowski who recently sat where you're sitting he thinks that ai will almost surely kill everyone do you agree with him or not yes but maybe for a different reason okay and then i'll try to get you to find hope or we could find a no to that answer but why yes okay why didn't nuclear weapons kill everyone that's a good question i think there's an answer i think it's actually very hard to deploy nuclear weapons tactically mhmm it's very hard to accomplish tactical objectives great i can nuke their country i have a irradiated pile of rubble i don't want that why not why don't i want an irradiated pile of rubble yeah for all the reasons no one wants an irradiated pile of rubble oh because you can't use that land for for resources you can't populate the land yeah what what you want a a a total victory in a war is not usually the er radiation and eradication of the people there it's the subjugation and domination of the people okay so you can't use this strategically tactically in a war yeah to help you to to help gain a military advantage it's all complete destruction alright yeah but there's egos involved it's still surprising still surprising that nobody pressed the big red button it's somewhat surprising but you see it's the little red button that's gonna be pressed with ai that's gonna you know and that's why we die it's it's not because the ai if there's anything in the nature of ai it's just the nature of humanity what's the algorithm behind the little red button what like what what what possible ideas do you have for the how human species ends sure so i think the most obvious way to me is wireheading we end up amusing ourselves to death we end up all staring at that infinite tiktok and forgetting to eat maybe maybe it's even more benign than this maybe we all just stop reproducing now to be fair it's probably hard hard to get all of humanity yeah yeah it probably always go like the the interesting thing about humanity is the diversity in it oh yeah organisms in general there's a lot of weirdos out there well two of them are sitting here yeah i mean diversity in humanity is we do respect i wish i was more weird no like i'm kinda look i'm drinking smart water man that's like a coca cola product right do you want corporate george haas i want corporate no the amount of diversity in humanity i think is decreasing just like all the other biodiversity on the planet oh boy yeah right and social media is not helping go eat mcdonald's in china yeah yeah no it it's the interconnectedness that's that's that's that's doing it oh that's interesting so everybody starts relying on the connectivity of the internet and over time that reduces the diversity the intellectual diversity and then that gets you everybody into a funnel there's still going to be a guy in texas there is and yeah in a bunker to to be fair do i think ai kills us all i think ai kills everything we call like society today i do not think it actually kills the human species i think that's actually incredibly hard to do yeah but society like if we start over that's tricky most of us don't know how to do most things yeah but some of us do and they'll be okay and they'll rebuild after they great ai what's rebuilding look like how far like how much do we lose like what what what has human civilization done that's interesting a combustion engine electricity so power and energy that's interesting like how to harness energy woah woah woah woah they're gonna be religiously against that are they going to get back to like fire sure i mean there'll be a there'll be a it'll be like you know some kinda amish looking kinda thing i think i think they're going to have very strong taboos against technology like technology is almost like a new religion technology is the devil yeah and nature is god sure so closer to nature but can you really get away from ai if it destroyed ninety nine percent of the human species isn't it somehow have a hold like a stronghold what's interesting about everything we build i think we are going to build superintelligence before we build any sort of robustness in the ai we cannot build an ai that is capable of going out into nature and surviving like a like a bird right a bird is an incredibly robust organism we've built nothing like this we haven't built a machine that's capable of reproducing yes but there is you know i work with lego robots a lot now i have a bunch of them they're mobile mhmm they can't reproduce but all they need is i guess you're saying they can't repair themselves but if you have a large number if you have like a hundred million of them let's just focus on them reproducing right they have microchips in them mhmm okay then do they include a fab no then how are they gonna reproduce well they're they it it doesn't have to be all onboard right they can go to a a factory to a repair shop yeah but then you're really moving away from robustness yes all of life is capable of reproducing without needing to go to a repair shop mhmm life will continue to reproduce in the complete absence of civilization robots will not so when the if if the ai apocalypse happens i mean the ais are gonna probably die out because i think we're gonna get again superintelligence long before we get robustness what about if you just improve the fab to where you you just have a three d printer that can always help you well that'd be very interesting i'm interested in building that of course you are you think how difficult is that problem to have a robot that basically can build itself very very hard i think you've mentioned this like to me or somewhere where people think it's easy conceptually and then they remember that you're gonna have to have a fab yeah on board of course so three d printer that prints a three d printer yeah yeah on legs why is that hard well because it's i mean a three d printer is a very simple machine right okay you're gonna print chips you're gonna have an atomic printer how are you gonna dope the silicon yeah right how are you gonna etch the silicon you're gonna have to have a a a very interesting kind of fab if you wanna have a lot of computation onboard but you can do like structural type of robots that are dumb yeah but structural type of robots aren't gonna have the intelligence required to survive in any complex environment what about like ants type of systems we have like trillions of them i don't think this works i mean again like ants at their very core are made up of cells that are capable of individually reproducing they're doing quite a lot a lot of computation that we're taking for granted it's not even just the computation it's that reproduction is so inherent okay so like there's two stacks of life in the world mhmm there's bio the biological stack and the silicon stack the biological stack starts with reproduction reproduction is at the absolute core the first proto rna organisms we're capable of reproducing right the silicon stack despite as far as it's come is nowhere near being able to reproduce yeah so the the the fab movement digital fabrication fabrication in the full range of what that means is still in the early stages yeah you're interested in this world even if you did put a fab on the machine right let's say okay you know we can build that we know how to do that as humanity we can probably put all the precursors that build all the machines and the fabs also in the machine so first off this machine is gonna be absolutely massive i mean we almost have a like think of the size of the thing required to reproduce a machine today right like is our civilization capable of reproduction can we reproduce our civilization on mars if we were to construct a machine that is made up of humans like a company mhmm that can reproduce itself yeah i don't know i it feels like like like a hundred fifteen people i think it's so much harder than that hundred twenty i should be looking for a number i believe that twitter can be run by fifty people uh-huh i think that this is gonna take most of like it's just most of society right like we live in one globalized world no but you're not interested in running twitter you're interested in seeding like you want to seed a civilization and then because humans can like oh okay you're talking about yeah okay so you're talking about the humans reproducing and like basically like what's the smallest self sustaining colony of humans yeah yeah okay fine but they're not gonna be making five nanometer chips over time they will i think you're being like we have to expand our conception of time here going back to the original alright time scale i mean over across maybe a hundred generations we're back to making chips no if you seed the colony correctly maybe or maybe they'll watch our colony die out over here and be like we're not making chips don't make chips no but you have to seed that colony correctly whatever you do don't make chips chips are what led to their downfall well that is the thing that humans do they they come up they construct a devil a good thing and a bad thing and they really stick by that and then they murder each other over that there's always one asshole in the room who murders everybody and he usually makes tattoos and nice branding yes do you need that asshole that's the question right humanity works really hard today to get rid of that asshole but i think they might be important yeah this whole freedom of speech thing it's it's the freedom of being an asshole seems kind of important that's right man this thing this fab this human fab that we've constructed this human civilization is pretty interesting and now it's building artificial copies of itself or artificial copies of various aspects of itself that seem interesting like intelligence and i wonder where that goes i like to think it's just like another stack for life like we have like the biostack life like we're a biostack life and then the siliconstack life but it seems like the ceiling or there might not be a ceiling and or at least the ceiling is much higher for the for the silicon stack oh no i don't i we don't know what the ceiling is for the biostack either the biostack the biostack just seem seem to move slower you have moore's law which is not dead despite many proclamations in the biostack or the silicon in the silicon stack uh-huh and you don't have anything like this in the biostack so i have a a meme that i i posted i tried to make a meme it didn't work too well but i posted a picture of you know ronald reagan and and joe biden and you look this is nineteen eighty and this is twenty twenty yeah and these two humans are basically like the same right there's no there's no like like there there's been no change in humans in the last forty years yeah and then i posted a computer from nineteen eighty and a computer from twenty twenty wow yeah with their early early stages right which is why you said when you said the fab the size of the fab required to make another fab is like very large right now oh yeah but computers were very large eighty years ago and they got pretty tiny and the the people are starting to wanna wear them on their face in order to escape reality that's the thing in order to be live inside the computer sure put a screen right here i don't have to see the rest of you assholes i've been ready for a long time you like virtual reality i love it do you wanna live there yeah yeah part of me does too how far away are we do you think judging from what you can buy today far very far i gotta tell you that i had the experience of meta's kodak avatar where it's a ultra high resolution scan it looked real i mean the headsets just are not quite at like eye resolution yet i haven't put on any headset where i'm like oh i this could be the real world whereas when i put good headphones on audio is there and like we we can reproduce audio that i'm like i'm actually in a jungle right now i i if i close my eyes i can't tell i'm not yeah but then there's also smell and all that kind of stuff sure i don't know i the the power of imagination or the power of the the mechanism in the human mind that fills the gaps that kinda reaches and wants to make the thing you see in the virtual world real to you i believe in that power or humans wanna believe yeah like what what if you're lonely what if you're sad what if you're really struggling in life and here's a world where you don't have to struggle anymore humans wanna believe so much that people think the large language models are conscious that's how much humans wanna believe strong words he's throwing left and right hooks okay why do you think large language models are not conscious i don't think i'm conscious oh so what is consciousness then george hans it's like what it seems to mean to people it's just like a word that atheists use for souls sure but that doesn't mean soul is not an interesting word if consciousness is a spectrum i'm definitely way more conscious than the large language models are i think the large language models are less conscious than a chicken when is the last time you've seen a chicken in miami like couple months ago how no like a living chicken living chickens walking around miami it's crazy like on the street yeah like a chicken a chicken yeah alright alright i was trying to call you out like like a good journalist and i i got shut down okay but you don't think much about this kind of subjective feeling that it it feels like something to exist and then as an observer you can have a sense that an entity is not only intelligent but has a kinda subjective experience of its reality like a self awareness that is capable of like suffering of hurting of being excited by the environment in a way that's not merely kind of an artificial response but a deeply felt one humans wanna believe so much that if i took a rock and a sharpie and drew a sad face on the rock they'd think the rock is sad yeah and you're saying when we look in the mirror we we apply the same smiley face with rock pretty much yeah doesn't that isn't that weird though that we're you're not conscious is that no but you do believe in consciousness not really it's just an it's unclear okay so to you it's like a little like a a symptom of the bigger thing that's not that important yeah i mean it's interesting that like human systems seem to claim that they're conscious and i guess it kind of like says something in a straight up like okay what do people mean when even if you don't believe in consciousness what do people mean when they say consciousness and there's definitely like meanings to it what's your favorite thing to eat pizza cheese pizza what are the toppings i like cheese pizza i like don't say pineapple no i don't like pineapple okay pepperoni pizza put any ham on it oh that's real bad what's the best what's the best pizza what are we talking about here like do you like cheap crappy pizza chicago deep dish cheese pizza oh that's that's my favorite there you go you bite into a deep dish chicago deep dish pizza and it feels like so you were starving you haven't eaten oh yeah for twenty four hours you just bite in and you're hanging out with somebody that matters a lot to you and you're there with the pizza sounds real nice sir yeah alright it feels like something i'm i'm george motherfucking hot eating a fucking chicago deep dish pizza there's just the full peak light living experience yeah of being human the top of the human condition sure it feels like something to experience that mhmm why does it feel like something that's consciousness isn't it if that's the word you wanna use to describe it sure i'm not gonna deny that that feeling exists i'm not gonna deny that i experienced that feeling when i guess what i kind of take issue to is that there's some like like how does it feel to be a web server do four zero fours hurt not yet how would you know what suffering looked like sure you can recognize a suffering dog because we're the same stack as the dog all the biostack stuff kind of especially mammals you know it's it's really easy you can game recognizes game yeah versus the silicon stack stuff it's like you have no idea you have you it oh wow the little thing has learned to mimic you know but then i realized that that's all we are too oh look the little thing has learned to mimic yeah i guess yeah four four zero four could be could be suffering but it's so far from our kind of living organism our kind of stack but it feels like ai can start maybe mimicking the biological stack better better better because it's trained retrained it yeah and so in that maybe that's the definition of consciousness is the the biostat consciousness the definition of consciousness is how close something looks to human sure i'll give you that one no how close something is to the human experience sure it's a very it's a very anthropocentric definition but wait that's all we got sure no and i i don't mean to like i think there's a lot of value in it look i just started my second company my third company will be ai girlfriends oh like i mean i wanna find out what your fourth company is after that oh wow because i think once you have ai girlfriends it's oh boy does it get interesting well maybe let's go there i mean the relationships with ai that's creating human like organisms right and part of being human is being conscious is being having the capacity to suffer having the capacity to experience this life richly in such a way that you can empathize the ai system can empathize with you and you can empathize with it or you can project your anthropomorphic sense of what the other entity is experiencing and and an ai model would need to yeah to create that experience inside your mind and it doesn't seem that difficult yeah but okay so here's where it actually gets totally different right when you interact with another human you can make some assumptions yeah when you interact with these models you can't you can make some assumptions that that other human experiences suffering and pleasure in a pretty similar way to you do the golden rule applies mhmm with an ai model this isn't really true right these these large language models are good at fooling people because they were trained on a a whole bunch of human data and told to mimic it yep but if if the ai system says hi my name is samantha it has a backstory yeah i went to college here and there yeah maybe it'll integrate this in the ai system i made some chatbots i gave them backstories it was lots of fun i was so happy when llama came out yeah we'll talk about llama we'll talk about all that but like you know the rock with the smiley face yeah well it's it seems pretty natural for for you to anthropomorphize that thing and then start dating it and before you know it you're married and have kids with a rock with a rock and there's pictures on instagram with you and a rock and a smiley face to be fair like you know something that people generally look for when they're looking for someone to date is intelligence in some form and the rock doesn't really have intelligence only a pretty desperate person would date a rock i think we're all desperate deep down oh not rock level desperate alright not rock level desperate but ai level desperate i don't know i think all of us have a deep loneliness it just feels like the language models are there oh i agree and you know what i won't even say this so cynically i will actually say this in a way that like i want ai friends i do yeah like i would love to you know again i the language models now are still a little like people are impressed with these gpt things and i look at like or or like or the the copilot the coding one and i'm like okay this is like junior engineer level and these people are like fiverr level artists and copywriters like okay great we got like fiverr and like junior engineers okay cool like and this is just a start and it will get better right like i would i can't wait to have ai friends who are more intelligent than i am so fiverr is just a temporary it's not the ceiling no definitely not is it is it count as cheating when you're talking to an ai model emotional cheating that's that's up to you and your human partner to define oh you have to alright you can yeah you you have to have that have to have that conversation i guess alright i mean integrate that with with porn and all this well i know i mean it's similar kind of to porn yeah yeah right i think people in relationships have different views on that yeah but most people don't have like serious open conversations about all the different aspects of what's cool and what's not and it feels like ai is a really weird conversation to have the the the porn one is a good branching off sure like these things you know one of my scenarios that i put in my chatbot is a you know a nice girl named lexi she's twenty she just moved out to la she wanted to be an actress but she started doing only fans instead and you're on a date with her enjoy oh man yeah and so is that if you're actually dating somebody in in real life is that cheating i feel like it gets a little weird sure it gets real weird it's like what are you allowed to say to an ai bot imagine having that conversation with a significant other i mean these are all things for people to define in their relationships what it means to be human is just gonna start to get weird especially online like how do you know like there'll be moments when you'll have what you think is a real human you interacted with on twitter for years and you realize it's not i spread i love this meme heaven banning mhmm do you know about shadow banning yeah right shadow banning okay you post no one can see it heaven banning you post no one can see it but a whole lot of ais are spun up to interact with you well maybe that's what the way human civilization ends is all of us have been banned there's a great it's called my little pony friendship is optimal mhmm it's a sci fi story that explores this idea friendship is optimal friendship is optimal yeah i'd like to have some at least stuff on the intellectual realm some ai friends yeah that argue with me but the the the romantic realm is weird definitely weird but not out of the realm of the the kind of weirdness that human civilization is capable of i think i think i want it look i want it if no one else wants it i want it yeah i think a lot of people probably want it there's a deep loneliness and i'll fill their loneliness and you know it just will only advertise to you some of the time yeah maybe the conceptions of monogamy changed too like i grew up in a time like i value monogamy but maybe that's a silly notion when you have arbitrary number of ai systems this this this interesting path from rationality to polyamory yeah that doesn't make sense for me for you but you're just a biological organism who was born before like re the internet really took off the crazy thing is like culture is whatever we define it as right these things are not you the like is ought problem in moral philosophy right there's no like like okay what is might be that like computers are capable of mimicking you know girlfriends perfectly they pass the girlfriend turing test right but that doesn't say anything about ought that doesn't say anything about how we ought to respond to them as a civilization that doesn't say we ought to get rid of monogamy right that's a completely separate question really a religious one girlfriend turing test i wonder what that looks like girlfriend turing test are you writing that will you be the the the alan turing of the twenty first century that writes the the girlfriend turing test part i mean of course my my ai girlfriends their goal is to pass the girlfriend turing test no but you there should be like a paper that kinda defines the test or so it i mean the question is if it's deeply personalized or there's a common thing that really gets everybody yeah i mean you know look we're a company we don't have to get everybody we just have to get a large enough clientele status i thought you're already already thinking company alright let's before we go to company number three and company number four let's go to company number two alright tiny corp possibly one of the greatest names of all time for a company you've launched a new company called tinycorp that leads the development of tinygrad what's the origin story of tinycorp and tinygrad i started tinygrad as a like a toy project just to teach myself okay like what is a convolution what are all these options you can pass to them what is the derivative of a convolution right very similar to karpathy wrote micro grad mhmm very similar and then i started realizing i started thinking about like ai chips i started thinking about chips that run ai and i was like well okay this is going to be a a really big problem if nvidia becomes a monopoly here how long before nvidia is nationalized so you one of the reasons to start tinycorp is to challenge nvidia it's not so much to challenge nvidia i i actually i i like nvidia and it's to make sure power stays decentralized yeah and here's computational power mhmm and to you nvidia is kinda locking down the computational power of the world if nvidia becomes just like ten x better than everything else you're giving a big advantage to somebody who can secure nvidia as a resource yeah in fact if jensen watches this podcast he may wanna consider this he may wanna consider making sure his company is not nationalized do you think that's an actual threat oh yes no but there's so much you know there's amd mhmm so we have nvidia and amd great alright but you don't you don't think there's like a push towards like selling like google selling tpus or something like this you don't think there's a push for that have you seen it google loves to rent you tpus it doesn't you can't buy it at best buy no so i started work on a on a chip i was like okay what's it gonna take to make a chip and my first notions were all completely wrong about why about like how you can improve on gpus and i will take this this is from jim keller on your podcast mhmm and this is one of my absolute favorite descriptions of computation so there's three kinds of computation paradigms that are common in the world today there's cpus and cpus can do everything cpus can do add and multiply they can do load and store and they can do compare and branch mhmm and when i say they can do these things they can do them all fast right so compare and branch are unique to cpus and what i mean by they can do them fast is they can do things like branch prediction and speculative execution and they spend tons of transistors on these like super deep reorder buffers in order to make these things fast then you have a simpler computation model gpus gpus can't really do compare and branch i mean they can but it's horrendously slow but gpus can do arbitrary load and store right gpus can do things like x dereference y so they can fetch from arbitrary pieces of memory they can fetch from memory that is defined by the contents of the data the third model of computation dsps and dsps are just add and multiply right like they can do load in stores but only static load in stores only loads in stores that are known before the program runs and you look at neural networks today and ninety five percent of neural networks are all the dsp paradigm they are just statically scheduled adds and multiplies so tinyguard really took this idea and and i'm still working on it to extend this as far as possible every stage of the stack has turing completeness right python has turing completeness and then we take python we go to c plus plus which is turing complete and maybe c plus plus calls into some cuda kernels which are turing complete the cuda kernels go through lvm which is turing complete into ptx which is turing complete to sas which is turing complete on a turing complete processor i wanna get turing completeness out of the stack entirely because once you get rid of turing completeness you can reason about things rice's theorem and the halting problem do not apply to admiral machines okay what's the power and the value of getting turing completeness out of out of are we talking about the hardware or or the software every layer of the stack every layer every layer of the stack removing turing completeness allows you to reason about things right so the reason you need to do branch prediction in a cpu and the reason it's prediction and the branch predictors are i think they're like ninety nine percent on cpus why did they get one percent of them wrong well they get one percent wrong because you can't know right that's the halting problem it's equivalent to the halting problem to say whether a branch is gonna be taken or not i can show that but the admob machine the neural network runs the identical compute every time the only thing that changes is the data so when you realize this you think about okay how can we build a computer how can we build a stack that takes maximal advantage of this idea mhmm so what makes tiny grad different from other neural network libraries is it does not have a primitive operator even for matrix multiplication right and this is every single one they even have primitive operators for things like convolutions so no matmul no matmul well here's what a matmul is so i'll use my hands to talk here mhmm so if you think about a cube and i put my two matrices that i'm multiplying on two faces of the cube mhmm right you can think about the matrix multiply as okay the n cubed i'm gonna multiply for each one in the cubed and then i'm gonna do a sum which is a reduce up to here to the third face of the cube and that's your multiplied matrix so what a matrix multiply is is a bunch of shape operations right a bunch of permute three shapes and expands on the two matrices a multiply n cubed a reduce n cubed which gives you an n squared matrix okay so what what is the minimum number of operations that can accomplish that if you don't have matmol as a primitive so tinygrad has about twenty and you can compare tinygrad's opsat or ir to things like xla or primtorch so xla and primtorch are ideas where like okay torch has like two thousand different kernels mhmm pytorch two point o introduced primtorch which has only two hundred fifty tinygrad has order of magnitude twenty five it's it's ten x less than xli or primtorch and you can think about it as kind of like risk versus cisc right these other things are cisc like systems tiny graders risk and risk one risk architecture is gonna change everything okay nineteen ninety five hackers wait really that's an actual thing angelina jolie delivers the line risk architecture is gonna change everything in nineteen ninety five wow and here we are with arm in the phones and arm everywhere wow i love it when movies actually have real things in them right okay interesting and so this is like so you're thinking of this as the risk architecture of ml stack twenty five what what can you can you go through the the four op types sure okay so you have unary ops which take in a tensor and return a tensor of the same size and do some unary op to it x log reciprocal sine right they take in one and they're point wise mhmm relu yeah relu almost all activation functions are unary ops some combinations of unary ops together is still a unary op mhmm then you have binary ops binary ops are like point wise addition multiplication division compare it takes in two tensors of equal size and outputs one tensor mhmm then you have reduce ops reduce ops will like take a three-dimensional tensor and turn it into a two dimensional tensor mhmm or a three-dimensional tensor turn it into zero dimensional tensor think like a sum or max are really like common ones there and then the fourth type is movement ops and movement ops are different from the other types because they don't actually require computation they require different ways to look at memory mhmm so that includes reshapes permutes expands flips those are the main ones probably and so with that you have enough to make a matmul and convolutions and every convolution you can imagine dilated convolutions strided convolutions transposed convolutions you're right on github about laziness showing a matmul matrix multiplication see how despite the style is fused into one kernel with the power of laziness can you elaborate on this power of laziness sure so if you type in pytorch a times b plus c what this is going to do is it's going to first multiply add and b a and b and store that result into memory mhmm and then it is going to add c by reading that result from memory reading c from memory and writing that out to memory there is way more loads and stores to memory than you need there if you don't actually do a times b as soon as you see it if you wait until the user actually realizes that tensor until the laziness actually resolves you confuse that plus c this is like it's the same way haskell works so what's the process of porting a model into tinygrad so tinygrad's front end looks very similar to pytorch i probably could make a perfect or pretty close to perfect interop layer if i really wanted to i think that there's some things that are nicer about tinygrad syntax than pytorch but the front end looks very torch like you can also load in onnx models okay we have more onnx tests passing than coreml core ml oh okay so we'll we'll pass onyx runtime soon what what about like the developer experience with tinygrad what it feels like what are the versus pytorch by the way i really like pytorch i i i think that it's actually a very good piece of software i think that they've made a few different trade offs and these different trade offs are where you know tiny grad takes a different path one of the biggest differences is it's really easy to see the kernels that are actually being sent to the gpu right if you run pytorch on the gpu you like do some operation and you don't know what kernels ran you don't know how many kernels ran you don't know how many flops were used you don't know how much memory accesses were used tinygrad type debug equals two and it will show you in this beautiful style every kernel that's run how many flops and how many bytes so can you just linger on what problem tinygrad solves tinygrad solves the problem of porting new ml accelerators quickly one of the reasons tons of these companies now i think sequoia marked graphcore to zero right cerebus tenstorrent grok all of these ml accelerator companies they built chips the chips were good the software was terrible mhmm and part of the reason is because i think the same problem is happening with dojo it's really really hard to write a pytorch port mhmm because you have to write two hundred fifty kernels and you have to tune them all for performance what does jim jim culler think about tiny grad you guys hung out quite a bit so he's you know he's he was involved he's involved with what's his praise and what's his criticism of what you're doing with your life look my prediction for tenstorrent is that they're gonna pivot to making risc five chips cpus cpus yeah why because ai accelerators are a software problem not really a hardware problem oh interesting so you don't think you you think the diversity of ai accelerators in the hardware space is not going to be a thing that exists long term i think what's gonna happen is if i can finish okay if you're trying to make an ai accelerator you better have the capability of writing a torch level performance stack on nvidia gpus if you can't write a torch stack on nvidia gpus and i mean all the way i mean down to the driver there's no way you're gonna be able to write it on your chip because your chip's worse than an nvidia gpu the first version of the chip you tape out it's definitely worse oh you're saying writing that stack is really tough yes and not only that actually the chip that you tape out almost always because you're trying to get advantage over nvidia you're specializing the hardware more it's always harder to write software for more specialized hardware like a gpu is pretty generic and if you can't write an nvidia stack there's no way you can write a stack for your chip so my approach with tinygrad is first write a performant nvidia stack we're we're targeting amd so you did say a few to nvidia a little bit with love with love yeah with love so like the yankees you know i'm a mets fan oh you're you're you're a mets fan a risk a risk fan and a mets fan what's the hope that amd has and you did a build with amd recently that i saw how does the the the seventy nine hundred x t x compare to the rtx forty ninety or forty eighty well let's start with the fact that the seventy nine hundred x t x kernel drivers don't work and if you run demo apps in loops it panics the kernel okay so if this is a software issue lisa sue responded to my email oh i reached out i was like this is you know really like i understand if your seven by seven transposed winograd com is slower than nvidia's but literally when i run demo apps in a loop the kernel panics so just adding that loop yeah i just i just literally took their demo apps and wrote like while true semicolon do the app semicolon done in a bunch of screens mhmm right this is like like the most primitive fuzz testing why do you think that is they're just not seeing a market in the in machine learning they're changing they're trying to change they're trying to change and i had a pretty positive interaction with them this week last week i i went on a huge but i was just like that's it i give up on amd like this is the their their driver doesn't even like i'm not gonna i'm not gonna you know i'm i'll i'll go with intel gpus right intel gpus have better drivers so you're kinda spearheading the diversification of gpus yeah and i'd like to extend that diversification to everything i'd like to diversify the right the more my central thesis about the world is there's things that centralize power and they're bad and there's things that decentralize power and they're good everything i can do to help decentralize power i'd like to do so you're really worried about the centralization of nvidia that's interesting and you don't have a fundamental hope for the the pro proliferation of asics except in the cloud i'd like to help them with software no actually there's only the only asic that is remotely successful is google's tpu mhmm and the only reason that's successful is because google wrote a machine learning framework i i think that you have to write a competitive machine learning framework in order to be able to build an asic you think meta with pytorch builds a competitor i hope so okay they have one they have an internal one internal i mean public facing with a nice cloud interface and so on i don't want a cloud you don't like cloud i don't like cloud what do you think is the fundamental limitation of cloud fundamental limitation of cloud is who owns the the the off switch so it's power to the people yeah and you don't you don't like demand to have all the power exactly alright and right now the only way to do that is with nvidia gpus if you want performance and stability interesting it's a it's a costly investment emotionally to go with amds well let me add sort of on a tangent to ask you what what you've built quite a few pcs what's your advice on how to build a good custom pc for let's say for the different applications that you use for gaming for machine learning well you shouldn't build one you should buy a box from the tiny corp i heard rumors whispers about this box in the tiny corp what's what's this thing look like what it what is it what is it called it's called the tiny box tiny box it's fifteen thousand dollars yep and it's almost a paid a flop of compute it's over a hundred gigabytes of gpu ram it's over five terabytes per second of gpu memory bandwidth i'm gonna put like four nvmes in in in raid you're gonna get like twenty thirty gigabytes per second of drive read bandwidth i'm gonna i'm gonna build like the best deep learning box that i can that plugs into one wall outlet okay can you go through those specs again a little bit from your from memory yeah so it's almost a paid to flop of compute so in d intel today i'm leaning toward amd mhmm but we're pretty agnostic to the type of compute the the the main limiting spec is a one hundred twenty volt fifteen amp circuit okay well i mean it because in order to like like there's a plug over there mhmm right you have to be able to plug it in we're also gonna sell the tiny rack which like what's the most power you can get into your house without arousing suspicion and one of the one of the answers is an electric car charger wait where does the rack go your garage interesting the car charger a wall outlet is about fifteen hundred watts a car charger is about ten thousand watts yeah what is the most amount of power you can get your hands on without arousing suspicion that's right george haas okay so the the tiny box and you said nvme's and raid yeah i forget what you said about memory all that kind of stuff okay so what about what gpus again probably classic probably seventy nine hundred xtxs but maybe thirty nineties maybe a seven seventies those are intel's you're flexible or still exploring i'm still exploring i wanna i wanna deliver a really good experience to people mhmm and yeah what gpus i end up going with again i'm leaning toward amd we'll see you know in my email what i what i said to amd is like just dumping the code on github is not open source open source is a culture mhmm open source means that your issues are not all one year old stale issues open source means developing in public and if you guys can commit to that i see a real future for amd as a competitor to nvidia well i'd love to get a tiny box to mit so whenever it's ready okay let's do it we're taking preorders i i i took this from elon i'm like a hundred dollar fully refundable preorders is it gonna be like the cybertruck it's gonna take a few years or no i'll try to do it faster it's a lot simpler it's a lot simpler than a truck well there's complexities not to just the putting the thing together but like shipping and all this kind of stuff the thing that i wanna deliver to people out of the box is being able to run sixty five billion parameter llama in fp sixteen in real time in like a good like ten tokens per second or five tokens per second or something just it works yep llamas running or something like llama experian yeah or i think falcon is is is the new one experience a chat with the largest language model that you can have in your house yeah from from a wall plug from a wall plug yeah actually for inference it's not like even more power would help you get more even more power wouldn't get you more well no there's just the biggest param the biggest model released is is sixty five billion parameter lama as far as i know so it sounds like tinybox will naturally pivot towards company number three because you could just get the girlfriend and i mean or boyfriend that one's harder actually the boyfriend is harder the boyfriend's harder yeah i think that's a very biased statement i think a lot of people would just say what's what why is it harder to replace a boyfriend than a other girlfriend with the artificial llm because women are attracted to status and power and men are attracted to youth and beauty no i mean this is what i mean but what are both are could be a mimicable easy through the language model no no machines do not have any status or real power i don't know i think you both well first of all you're using language mostly to to communicate youth and beauty and power and status but status fundamentally is a zero sum game right whereas youth and beauty are not no i think status is a narrative you can construct i i don't think status is real i don't know i i just think that that's why it's harder you know yeah maybe it is my biases i think status is way easier to fake i also think that you know men are probably more desperate and more likely to buy my product so maybe they're a better target market desperation is interesting easier to fool that's i could i could see that yeah look i mean look i know you can look at porn viewership numbers right a lot more men watch porn than women you can ask why that is there's a lot of questions and answers you can get there anyway with the with the tiny box how many gpus in tiny box six oh man and i'll tell you why it's six yeah so amd epyc processors have a hundred twenty eight lanes of pcie mhmm i wanna leave enough lanes for some drives mhmm and i wanna leave enough lanes for some networking how do you do cooling for something like this that's one of the big challenges not only do i want the cooling to be good i want it to be quiet i want the tiny box to be able to sit comfortably in your room right this is really going towards the girlfriend thing because because you want to run the llm i'll give i'll give a more i mean i can talk about how it relates to company number one karma ai yeah well but yes quiet oh quiet because you might maybe you potentially wanna run-in a car no no quiet because you wanna put this thing in your house and you want it to coexist with you if it's screaming at sixty db you don't want that in your house you'll kick it out sixty db yeah yeah want like forty forty five so how do you make the cooling quiet that's an interesting problem in itself a key trick is to actually make it big ironically it's called the tiny box yeah but if i can make it big a lot of that noise is generated because of high pressure air mhmm if you look at like a one u server a one u server has these super high pressure fans they're like super deep and they they're like genesys versus if you have something that's big well i can use a big and you know you know they call them big ass fans those ones that are like huge on the ceiling and they're completely silent so tiny box will be big it is the i do not want it to be large according to ups i want it to be shippable as a normal package but that's my constraint there interesting well the the fan stuff like can't can't it be assembled on location or no no oh it has to be well you're you're look i wanna give you a great out of the box experience i want you to lift this thing out i want it to be like like the mac you know tiny box the apple experience yeah i love it okay and so tinybox would run tinygrad like what what what do you envision this whole thing to look like we're talking about like linux with a full software engineering environment it's just not pytorch but tinygrad yeah we did a poll if people want ubuntu or arch we're gonna stick with ubuntu oh interesting what's your favorite flavor of what's it ubuntu i like ubuntu mate however you pronounce that meat so how do you you've gotten llama into tiny grad you've gotten stable diffusion into tiny grad what was that like can you comment on like what are what are these models what's interesting about porting them what's yeah like what what are the the challenges what are what's naturally what's easy all that kinda stuff there's a really simple way to get these models into tinygrad and you can just export them as onix mhmm and then tinygrad can run onix so the ports that i did of llama stable stable diffusion and now whisper are more academic to teach me about the models but they are cleaner than the pytorch versions you can read the code i think the code is easier to read it's less lines there's just a few things about the way tinygrid writes things here's here's a complaint i have about pytorch n n dot relu is a class right mhmm so when you create a when you create an nn module you'll put your nn relus as in a net and this makes no sense relu is completely stateless why should that be a class the but that's more like a software engineering thing or do you think it has a cost on performance oh no it doesn't have a cost on performance but yeah no i i think that it it's that's what i mean about like tinygrad's front end being cleaner i see what do you think about mojo i don't know if you've been paying attention to the programming language that does some interesting ideas that kinda intersect tinygrad i think that there's a spectrum and like on one side you have mojo and on the other side you have like g g m l mhmm g g m l is this like we're gonna run llama fast on mac mhmm okay we're gonna expand out to a little bit but we're gonna basically go to like depth first right mojo is like we're gonna go breath first we're gonna go so wide that we're gonna make all of python fast mhmm and tiny grads in the middle tinygrad is we are going to make neural networks fast yeah but they they try to really get it to be fast compiled down to specifics hardware and make that compilation step as flexible and resilient as possible yeah but they have turing completeness and that limits you turing that's what you're saying it's somewhere in the middle so you're actually going to be targeting some accelerators some like some some number not one my goal is step one build an equally performance stack to pytorch on nvidia and amd mhmm but with way less lines and then step two is okay how do we make an accelerator right but you need step one you have to first build the framework before you can build the accelerator can you explain mlperf what's your approach in general to benchmarking tiny grad performance so i'm much more of a like build it the right way and worry about performance later there's a bunch of things where i haven't even like really dove into performance the only place where tinygrad is competitive performance wise right now is on qualcomm gpus mhmm so tinygrad is actually used in openpilot to run the model mhmm so the driving model is is is tinygrad when did that happen that transition about eight months ago now and it's two x faster than qualcomm's library what's the hardware of open that openpilot runs on the the of the common app it's a snapdragon eight forty five okay so this is using the gpu so the gpu is an adreno gpu there's like different things there's a really good microsoft paper that talks about like mobile gpus and why they're different from desktop gpus mhmm one of the big things is in a desktop gpu you can use buffers on a mobile gpu image textures are a lot faster on a mobile gpu image textures and image okay and so you want to be able to leverage that i wanna be able to leverage it in a way that it's completely generic right so there's a lot of this xiaomi has a pretty good open source library for mobile gpus called mace where they can generate where they have these kernels but they're all hand coded right so that's great if you're doing three by three convs that's great if you're doing dense mat models but the minute you go off the beaten path a tiny bit well your performance is nothing since you mentioned openpilot i'd love to get an update in the company number one calm ai world how are things going there in the development of semi autonomous driving you know almost no one talks about fsd anymore and even less people talk about openpilot mhmm we've solved the problem like we solved it years ago what's the problem exactly well i what what what does solving it mean solving means how do you build a model that outputs a human policy for driving mhmm how do you build a model that given our you know reasonable set of sensors outputs a human policy for driving so you have you know companies like wyman cruise which are hand coding these things that are like quasi human policies then you have tesla and maybe even to more of an extent comma asking okay how do we just learn human policy from data the big thing that we're doing now and we just put it out on twitter at the beginning of comma we published a paper called learning a driving simulator mhmm and the way this thing worked was it's a it was an autoencoder and then an rnn in the middle right you take an autoencoder you compress the picture you use an rnn predict the next state and these things were you know it was a laughably bad simulator right this is twenty fifteen error machine learning technology today we have vq vae and transformers mhmm we're building drive gpt basically drive gpt okay so and it's trained on what is it trained in a self supervised way yeah it's trained on all the driving data to predict the next frame so really trying to learn a human policy what would a human do well actually our simulator is conditioned on the pose so it's it's actually a simulator you can put in like a state action pair and get out the next state okay and then once you have a simulator you can do rl in the simulator and rl will get us that human policy so it transfers yeah rl with a reward function not asking is this close to the human policy but asking would a human disengage if you did this behavior okay let me think about the the distinction there would a human disengage would a human disengage that correlates i guess with the human policy but it could be different so it's it it doesn't just say what would a human do it says what would a good human driver do yeah and such that the experience is comfortable but also not annoying in that like the thing is very cautious yeah so it's in the finding a nice balance that's that's interesting it's a nice it's asking exactly the right question what will make our customers happy right a system that you never wanna disengage because usually disengagement is almost always a sign of i'm not happy with what the system is doing usually there's some that are just i felt like driving and those are always fine too but they're just gonna look like noise in the data but even that felt like driving maybe yeah right even that's a signal like why do you feel like driving you're you need to recalibrate your relationship with the car okay so what that that's really interesting how close are we to solving self driving it's hard to say we haven't completely closed the loop yet so we don't have anything built that truly looks like that architecture yet we have prototypes and there's bugs so we are a couple bug fixes away might take a year might take ten what's the nature of the bugs are these these major philosophical bugs logical bug what kinda what kinda bugs are we talking about they're just like they're just like stupid bugs and like also we might just need more scale we just massively expanded our compute cluster at comma mhmm we now have about two people worth of compute forty petaflops well people people are different yeah twenty beta flops that's a person i mean it's just a it's just a unit right horses are different too but we still call it a horsepower yeah but there's something different about mobility than there is about perception and action in a very complicated world but yes well yeah of course not all flops are created equal if you have randomly initialized weights it's not gonna not all flops are created equal and so flops are doing way more useful things than others yep yep tell me about it okay so more data scale means more scale in compute or scale in scale of data both and diversity of data diversity is very important in data yeah i mean we have so we have about i think we have like five thousand daily actives how would you evaluate how fsd is doing pretty well driving pretty well how's that race going between com ai and fsd tesla is always one to two years ahead of us they've always been one to two years ahead of us and they probably always will be because they're not doing anything wrong what have you seen that's since the last time we talked that are interesting architectural decisions training decisions like the way the way they deploy stuff the architectures they're using in terms of the software how the teams are run all that kind of stuff data collection anything interesting i mean i know they're moving toward more of an end to end approach so creeping towards end to end as much as possible across the whole thing the the training the data collection everything they also have a very fancy simulator they're probably saying all the same things we are they're probably saying we just need to optimize you know what is the reward we get negative reward for disengagement right like everyone kinda knows this it's just a question who can actually build and deploy the system yeah i mean this could it requires good software engineering i think yeah and and the right kind of hardware yeah the hardware to run it you still don't believe in cloud in that regard i have a compute cluster in my eight hundred amps tiny grad it's forty kilowatts at idle our data center diving crazy forty kilowatts is burning just when the computers are idle just when i oh sorry sorry compute cluster compute cluster i got it it's not a data center yeah yeah no data centers are clouds we don't have clouds data centers have air conditioners we have fans that makes it a compute cluster i'm guessing this is a kind of a legal distinction if you want to yeah we have a compute cluster you said that you don't think llms have consciousness or at least not more than a chicken do you think they can reason is there something interesting to you about the word reason about some of the capabilities that we think is kind of human to be able to integrate complicated information and through a chain of thought arrive at a conclusion that feels novel a novel integration of the of disparate facts yeah i i don't think that there's i think that they can reason better than a lot of people hey isn't that amazing to you though isn't that like an incredible thing that a transformer could achieve i mean i think that calculators can add better than a lot of people but language feels like reasoning through the process of language which looks a lot like thought making brillianties in chess which feels a lot like thought like whatever new thing that ai can do everybody thinks is brilliant and then like twenty years go by and they're like well yeah but chess that's like mechanical like adding that's like mechanical so you think language is not that special it's like chess it's like chess and it's like i don't know and because it's very human we we take it we listen there is something different between chess and and language chess is a game that a subset of population plays language is something we use nonstop for all of our human interaction and human interaction is fundamental to society so it's like holy shit this this language thing is not so difficult to like create in the machine the problem is if you go back to nineteen sixty and you tell them that you have a machine that can play amazing chess of course someone in nineteen sixty will tell you that machine is intelligent someone in twenty ten won't what's changed right today we think that these machines that have language are intelligent but i think in twenty years we're gonna be like yeah but can it reproduce so reproduction yeah we might redefine what it means to to be what is it a high performance living organism on earth humans are always gonna define a niche for themselves like well you know we're better than the machines because we can you know and like they tried creative for a bit but no one believes that one anymore but nish is is that is that delusional or is there some accuracy to that because maybe like with chess you start to realize like that that we have ill conceived notions of what what makes humans special like the apex organism on earth yeah and i think maybe we're gonna go through that same thing with language and that same thing with creativity but language carries these notions of truth and so on and so we might be like wait maybe truth is not carried by language maybe there's like a deeper thing the niche is getting smaller oh boy but no no no you don't understand humans are created by god and machines are created by humans therefore right like that'll be the last issue we have so what do you think about this the rapid development of llms if we could just like stick on that it's still incredibly impressive like with chargebeet just even chargebeet what are your thoughts about reinforcement learning with human feedback on these large language models i'd like to go back to when calculators first came out mhmm and or computers and like i wasn't around look i'm i'm thirty three years old and to like see how that affected like society maybe you're right so i wanna put on the the the big picture hat here oh my god a refrigerator wow refrigerator electricity all that kind of stuff but you know with the internet large language models seeming human like basically passing a turing test mhmm it seems it might have really at scale rapid transformative effects on society but you're saying like other technologies have as well so maybe calculator is not the best example of that because that just seems like may well no maybe calculator but before milkman the day he learned about refrigerators he's like i'm done you're telling me you can just keep the milk in your house you don't need me to deliver it every day i'm done well yeah the you have to actually look at the practical impacts of certain technologies that that they've had yeah probably electricity is a big one and also how rapidly it's spread man the internet is a big one i do think it's different this time though it just feels like the niche is getting smaller the niche is humans yes that makes humans special yes yes it feels like it's getting smaller rapidly though doesn't it or is that just the feeling we dramatize everything i think we dramatize everything i think that that that you ask the milkman when he saw refrigerators are they gonna have one of these in every home yeah yeah yeah yeah make but boy is it impressive so much more impressive than seeing a a chess world champion ai system i disagree actually i disagree i think things like muzero and alphago are so much more impressive because these things are playing beyond the highest human level the language models are writing middle school level essays and people are like wow it's a great essay it's a great five paragraph essay about the causes of the civil war okay forget the civil war just generating code codex oh so you're you're saying it's mediocre code terrible but i don't think it's terrible i think it's just mediocre code yeah often close to correct like for mediocre that's the scariest kind of code i spent five percent of time typing and ninety five percent of time debugging the last thing i want is close to correct code i want a machine that can help me with the debugging not with the typing you know it's like l two level two driving similar kind of thing yeah it's you still should be a good programmer in order to modify i wouldn't even say debugging it's just modifying the code reading it don't think it's like level two driving i think driving is not tool complete and programming is meaning you don't use like the best possible tools to drive right you're not you're not like like like cars have basically the same interface for the last fifty years yep computers have a radically different interface okay can you describe the concept of tool complete yeah so think about the difference between a car from nineteen eighty and a car from today yeah no difference really it's got a bunch of pedals it's got a steering wheel great maybe now it has a few adas features but it's pretty much the same car right you have no problem getting into a nineteen eighty car and driving it you take a programmer today who spent their whole life doing javascript and you put them in an apple two e prompt and you tell them about the line numbers in basic but how do i insert something between line seventeen and eighteen oh well but so you in tool you're putting in the programming languages so it's just the entirety stack of the tooling exactly so it's not just like the like ids or something like this it's everything yes it's ides the languages the runtimes it's it's it's everything and programming is is tool complete so like almost if if if if codex or or copilot are helping you that actually probably means that your framework or library is bad and there's too much boilerplate in it yeah but don't you think so much programming has boilerplate tinygrad is now twenty seven hundred lines and it can run lama and stable diffusion and all of this stuff is in two thousand seven hundred lines boilerplate and abstraction in directions and all these things are just bad code well let's talk about good code and bad code because i would say i don't know for generic scripts that i write just offhand like i like eighty percent of it is written by gpt just like quick quick like offhand stuff so not like libraries not like performing code not stuff for robotics and so on just quick stuff because your basic so much of programming is doing some some yeah boilerplate but to do so efficiently and quickly because you can't really automate it fully with like generic method like a generic kind of id type of recommendation or something like this you do need to have some of the complexity of language models yeah i guess if i was really writing like maybe today if i wrote like a lot of like data parsing stuff yeah i mean i don't play ctfs anymore but if i still play ctfs a lot of like it's just like you have to write like a parser for this data format like i wonder or like admin of code mhmm i wonder when the models are gonna start to help with that kind of code and they may they may and the models also may help you with speed yeah the model's very fast but where the models won't i my programming speed is not at all limited by my typing speed and in very few cases it is yes if i'm writing some script to just like parse some weird data format sure my programming speed is limited by my typing speed what about looking stuff up because that's essentially a more efficient lookup right you know when i was at when i was at twitter i tried to use chatgpt to to like ask some questions like what's the api for this mhmm and it would just hallucinate it would just give me completely made up api functions that sounded real well do you think that's just a temporary kind of stage oh you don't think it'll get better and better and better in this kind of stuff because like it only hallucinates stuff in in the edge cases yes yes you write generic code it's actually pretty good yes if you are writing an absolute basic like react app with a button it's not gonna hallucinate sure no there there's kind of ways to fix the hallucination problem i think facebook has an interesting paper it's called atlas and it's actually weird the way that we do language models right now where all of the information is in the weights mhmm and the human brains don't really like this it's like a hippocampus and a memory system so why don't llms have a memory system and there's people working on them i think future llms are going to be like smaller but are going to run looping on themselves and are going to have retrieval systems and the thing about using a retrieval system is you can side sources explicitly which is really helpful to integrate the human into the loop of the of the thing because you can go check the sources and you can investigate so whenever the thing is hallucinating you can like have the human supervision so that's pushing it towards level two kind of direction gonna kill google wait which part when someone makes an llm that's capable of citing its sources it will kill google llm that's citing its sources because that's basically a search engine yeah that's what people want in the search engine but also google might be the people that build it maybe and put ads on it i'd count them out why is that what do you think who who wins this race we got who who are the competitors alright we got tinycorp i don't know if that's yeah i yeah i mean you're a legitimate competitor in that i'm not trying to compete on that you're not no not as accidentally stumble into that competition maybe you might build a search engine to replace google search when i started comma i said over and over again i'm going to win self driving cars i still believe that i have never said i'm going to win search with the tiny corp and i'm never going to say that because i won't the night is still young we don't you don't know how hard is it to win search in this new route like it's it it feels i mean one of the things that chat g p t kinda shows that there could be a few interesting tricks that really have that create a really compelling product some start ups are gonna figure it out i i think i think if you ask me like google is still the number one web page i think by the end of the decade google won't be the number one web page anymore so you don't think google because of the how big the corporation is look i i would put a lot more money on mark zuckerberg why is that because mark zuckerberg's alive like this is the old paul graham essay startups are either alive or dead google's dead facebook versus live facebook is alive meta is alive meta meta you see what i mean like that's just like like like zuckerberg this is mark zuckerberg reading that paul graham asking and being like i'm gonna show everyone how alive we are i'm gonna change the name so you don't think there's this gutsy pivoting engine of that like google doesn't have that the the the kind of engine that the startup has like constantly you know what being alive i guess when i listened to your sam altman podcast he talked about the button everyone who talks about ai talks about the button the button to turn it off right do we have a button to turn off google is anybody in the world capable of shutting google down what does that mean exactly the company or their end or the search engine so we shut the search engine down we shut the company down either can you elaborate on the value of that question does sundar pichai have the authority to turn off google dot com tomorrow who has the authority that's a good question right just anyone just anyone yeah i'm sure are you sure no they have the technical power but do they have the authority let's say sander pichai made this his sole mission yeah he came into google tomorrow and said i'm gonna shut google dot com down yeah i don't think you keep his position too long and what is the mechanism by which he wouldn't keep his position well boards and shares and corporate undermining and oh my god our revenue is zero now okay so what i mean what's the case you're making here so the the capitalist machine prevents you from mhmm having the button yeah and it will have a i mean this is true for the ais too right there's no turning the ais off there's no button you can't press it now does mark zuckerberg have that button for facebook dot com yes probably more i think he does i think he does and this is exactly what i mean and why i bet on him so much more than i bet on google i guess you could say elon has similar stuff oh elon has the button yeah elon does elon can elon fire the missiles can he fire the missiles i think some questions are better left unasked right i mean you know a rocket at an icbm well you have a rocket that can land anywhere is that an icbm well yeah you know don't ask too many questions my god but the the positive side of the button is that you can innovate aggressively is what you're saying it's what which is what's required with turning llm into a search engine i would bet on a start up i bet on because it's so easy right i bet on something that looks like mid journey but for search just it's able to set source and loop on itself i mean it just feels like one model can take off yeah right and nice wrapper and some of it scam i mean it's hard to like create a product that just works really nicely stably the other thing that's gonna be cool is there is some aspect of a winner take all effect right like once someone starts deploying a product that gets a lot of usage and you see this with openai they are going to get the dataset to train future versions of the model yeah they are going to be able to i you know i was asked at google image search when i worked there like almost fifteen years ago now how does google know which image is an apple and i said the metadata and they're like yeah that works about half the time how does google know you'll see the raw apples on the front page when you search apple mhmm and i don't know i didn't come up with the answer the guy's like well it's what people click on when they search apple mhmm i'm like oh yeah yeah yeah that data is really really powerful it's a human supervision what do you think of are the chances what what do you think in general that llama was open sourced i just did a conversation with with mark zuckerberg and he's all in on open source who would have thought that mark zuckerberg would be the good guy i mean it who would have thought anything in this world it's hard to know but open source to you ultimately is a good thing here undoubtedly you know what's ironic about all these ai safety people is they are going to build the exact thing they fear these we need to have one model that we control and align this is the only way you end up paper clipped there's no way you end up paper clipped if everybody has an ai so open sourcing is the way to fight the paperclip maximizer absolutely it's the only way you think you're gonna control it you're not gonna control it so the criticism you have for the ai safety folks is that there's belief and a desire for control yeah and that belief and desire for centralized control of dangerous ai systems is not good sam altman won't tell you that gpt four has two hundred twenty billion parameters and is a sixteen way mixture model with eight sets of weights who who did you have to murder to get that information alright i mean look but yes everyone at openai knows what i just said was true right now ask the question really you know it upsets me when i like gpt two when openai came out with gpt two and raised a whole fake ai safety thing about that i mean now the model is laughable like they they used ai safety to hype up their company and it's disgusting or the flip side of that is they used a relatively weak model in retrospect to explore how do we do ai safety correctly how do we release things how do we go through the process i don't i don't know if sure sure right right right that's that's i don't know how much hype there's irritable interpretation i don't know how much hype there is in ai safety honestly oh there's so much i at least on i don't know maybe twitter's not real life twitter's not real life come on in terms of hype i mean i don't i i think openai has been finding an interesting balance between transparency and putting value on ai safety you don't think you think just go all out open source to do a llama absolutely yeah so do like open source this this is a tough question which is open source both the the base the foundation model and the fine tune one so like the the model that can be ultra racist and dangerous and like tell you how to build a nuclear weapon oh my god have you met humans right like half of these ai allow met most humans i this makes this this this allows you to meet every human yeah i know but half of these ai alignment problems are just human alignment problems and that's what's also so scary about the language they use it's like it's not the machines you wanna align it's me but here's the thing it makes it very accessible to ask very questions where the answers have dangerous consequences if you were to act on them i mean yeah welcome to the world well no for me there's a lot of friction if i wanna find out how to i don't know blow up something no there's not a lot of friction that's so easy no like what do i search do i use bing or do i which search engine do i use no there's like lots of stuff we'll start with no it feels like i have to keep first off first off first off anyone who's stupid enough to search for how to blow up a building in my neighborhood is not smart enough to build a bomb right are you sure about that yes i i feel like i feel like a language model makes it more accessible for that person who's not smart enough to do they're not gonna they're not gonna build a bomb trust me the the the the people the people who are incapable of figuring out how to like ask that question a bit more academically and get a real answer from it are not capable of procuring the materials which are somewhat controlled to build a bomb no i think it'll makes it more accessible to people with money without the technical know how right to to build it like you do you really need to know how to build a bomb to to build a bomb you can hire people you can find like or you can hire people to build a you know what i was asking this question on my stream like can jeff bezos hire a hitman probably not but a language model can probably help you out yeah and you'll still go to jail right like it's not like the language model is god like the language model it's like it's you literally just hired someone on fiverr like you you so but okay k gpt four in terms of finding a hitman is like asking fiverr how to find a hitman i understand but don't you think wikihow you know wikihow but don't you think gpt five will be better because don't you think that information is out there on the internet i mean yeah and i think that if someone is actually serious enough to hire a hitman or build a bomb they'd also be serious enough to find the information i don't think so i think it makes it more accessible if you have if you have enough money to buy a hitman i think it it decreases the friction of how hard is it to find that kind of hitman i i honestly think this the there's a jump in ease and scale of how much harm you can do and i don't mean harm with language i mean harm with the actual violence what you're basically saying is like okay what's gonna happen is these people who are not intelligent are going to use machines to augment their intelligence and now intelligent people and machines intelligence is scary mhmm intelligent agents are scary when i'm in the woods the scariest animal to meet is a human mhmm right no no no no there's look there's like nice california humans like i see you're wearing like you know street clothes and nikes alright fine mhmm but you look like you've been a human who's been in the woods for a while yeah i'm more scared of you than a bear that's what they say about the amazon when you go to the amazon it's the human tribes oh yeah so intelligence is scary right so to to to like ask this question in a generic way you're like what if we took everybody who you know maybe has ill intention but is not so intelligent and gave them intelligence right so we should have intelligence control of course we should only give intelligence to good people and that is the absolutely horrifying idea so to you the best defense is actually the the best defense is to give more intelligence to the to the good guys and intel give intelligence to everybody give intelligence to everybody you know what it's not even like guns right like people say this about guns you know what's what's the best defense against a bad guy with a gun good guy with a gun like i kinda subscribe to that but i really subscribe to that with intelligence yeah in a fundamental way i i agree with you but there's just feels like so much uncertainty and so much can happen rapidly that you can lose a lot of control and you can do a lot of damage oh no we can lose control yes thank god yeah i hope we can i hope they lose control i want them to lose control more than anything else i think when you lose control you can do a lot of damage but you can do more damage when you centralize and hold on to control is the point centralized and held control is tyranny right i will always i don't like anarchy either but i will always take anarchy over tyranny anarchy you have a chance this human civilization we got going on is quite interesting i mean i agree with you so to you open source is the way forward here so you admire what facebook is doing here or what meta is doing with the release of them a lot yeah a lot i lost i lost eighty thousand dollars last year investing in meta and when they released llama i'm like yeah whatever man that was worth it it was worth it do you think google and openai with microsoft will match what what what meta is doing or no so if i were a researcher why would you wanna work at openai like you know you you're just you're on the bad team like i mean it like you're on the bad team who can't even say that gpt four has two hundred twenty billion parameters so closed source to use the bad team not only closed source i'm not saying you need to make your model weights open mhmm i'm not saying that i totally understand we're keeping our model weights closed because that's our product right that's fine i'm saying like because of ai safety reasons we can't tell you the number of billions of parameters in the model that's just the bad guys just because you're mocking ai safety doesn't mean it's not real oh of course is it possible that these things can really do a lot of damage that we don't know about oh my god yes intelligence is so dangerous be it human intelligence or machine intelligence intelligence is dangerous but machine intelligence is so much easier to deploy at scale like rapidly like what okay if you have human like bots on twitter alright and you have like a thousand of them create a whole narrative like you can manipulate millions of people but you mean like the intelligence agencies in america are doing right now yeah but they're not doing it that that well it feels like you can do a lot they're doing it pretty well what i think they're doing a pretty good job i i suspect they're not nearly as good as a bunch of gpt fueled bots could be well i mean of course they're looking into the latest technologies for control of people of course but i i think there's a george hoss type character that can do a better job than the entirety of them you don't think so no way no and i'll tell you why the george hoss character can't and i thought about this a lot with hacking mhmm right like i can find exploits in web browsers i probably still can i mean i was better when i was twenty four but yeah the thing that i lack is the ability to slowly and steadily deploy them over five years and this is what intelligence agencies are very good at right intelligence agencies don't have the most sophisticated technology mhmm they just have endurance endurance yeah and yeah the financial backing and the infrastructure for the endurance so the more we can decentralize power yeah like you could make an argument by the way that nobody should have these things and i would defend that argument i would i would like you're saying that look llms and ai and machine intelligence can cause a lot of harm so nobody should have it mhmm and i will respect someone philosophically with that position just like i will respect someone philosophically with the position that nobody should have guns right but i will not respect philosophically which with with only the trusted authorities should have access to this yeah who are the trusted authorities you know what i'm not worried about alignment between ai company and their machines i'm worried about alignment between me and ai company what do you think eleazar yatkowski would say to you because he's really against open source i know and i thought about this i thought about this and i think this comes down to a repeated misunderstanding of political power by the rationalists interesting i think that elias yudkowsky is scared of these things and i am scared of these things too mhmm everyone should be scared of these things these things are scary but now you ask about the two possible futures one where a small trusted centralized group of people has them and the other where everyone has them and i am much less scared of the second future than the first well there's a small trusted group of people that have control over our nuclear weapons there's a difference again a nuclear weapon cannot be deployed tactically and a nuclear weapon is not a defense against a nuclear weapon except maybe in some philosophical mind game kind of way but ai is different different how exactly okay let's say the intelligence agency deploys a million bots on twitter or a thousand bots on twitter to try to convince me of a point mhmm imagine i had a powerful ai running on my computer saying okay nice psyop nice psyop nice psyop okay here's a psyop i filtered it out for you yeah i i mean so you have fundamentally hope for that for the for the defensive psyop i'm not even like i don't even mean these things in like truly horrible ways i mean these things in straight up like ad blocker right yeah straight up ad blocker right i don't wanna heads yeah but they are always finding you know imagine i had an ai that could just block all the ads for me so you believe in the the power of the people to always create a non blocker yeah i mean i i i kinda share that belief i have that that's the one of the deepest optimisms i have is just like there's a lot of good guys so to give you don't you shouldn't handpick them just throw out powerful technology out there and the good guys will outnumber and out power yeah the bad guys yeah i'm not even gonna say there's a lot of good guys i'm saying that good outnumbers bad right good outnumbers bad in skill and performance yeah definitely in skill and performance probably just a number too probably just in general i mean if you know if you believe philosophically in democracy you obviously believe that that good outnumber is bad yeah and like the only if you give it to a small number of people there's a chance you gave it to good people but there's also a chance you gave it to bad people if you give it to everybody well if good outnumbers bad then you definitely gave it to more good people than bad that's really interesting so that's on the safety grounds but then also of course there's other motivations like you don't wanna give away your secret sauce well that's i mean i'm i i look i respect capitalism i don't think that i think that it would be polite for you to make model architectures open source and fundamental breakthroughs open source i don't think you have to make way it's open source you know what's interesting is that like there's so many possible trajectories in human history where you could have the next google be open source so for example i don't know if that connection is accurate but you know wikipedia made a lot of interesting decisions not to put ads like wikipedia is basically open source you could think of it that way yeah and like that's one of the main websites on the internet yeah and like it didn't have to be that way it could have been like google could have created wikipedia put ads on it you could probably run amazing ads now on wikipedia you wouldn't have to keep asking for money but it's interesting right so llama open source llama derivatives of open source llama might win the internet i sure hope so i i hope to see another era you know the kids today don't know how good the internet used to be and i don't think this is just oh come on like everyone's nostalgic for their past but i actually think the internet before small groups of weaponized corporate and government interests took it over was a beautiful place you know those small number of companies have created some sexy products but you're saying overall in the long arc of history the centralization of power they have like suffocated the human spirit at scale here's a question to ask about those beautiful sexy products imagine two thousand google to twenty ten google right mhmm a lot changed we got maps we got gmail mhmm we lost a lot of products too i think from yeah i mean somewhere probably we've got chrome right and now let's go from twenty ten we got android now let's go from twenty ten to twenty twenty what does google have well search engine maps mail android and chrome i see the internet was this you know i was time's person of the year in two thousand six yeah i love this it's you who was time's person of the year in two thousand six right like like that's you know so quickly did people forget and i think some of it's social media i think some of it i i hope look i hope that i i don't it's possible that some very sinister things happen i i don't i don't know i think it might just be like the effects of social media but something happened in the last twenty years no oh okay so you're you're just being an old man who's worried about the i think there's always it goes it's a cycle thing it's ups and downs and i think people rediscover the power of distributed of decentralized yeah i mean that's kinda like what the the whole like cryptocurrency is trying to that that i think crypto is just carrying the flame of that spirit of like stuff should should be decentralized it's just it's just such a shame that they all got rich you know yeah if you took all the money out of crypto it would have been a beautiful place yeah but no i mean these people you know they they they sucked all the value out of it and took it yeah money kinda corrupts the mind somehow it becomes this drug and you think it's all of crypto you had coins worth billions of dollars that had zero use yeah you still have hope for crypto sure i have hope for the ideas i really do yeah i mean you know i want the us dollar to collapse i do george watts well let me sort of on on the ai ai safety do you think there's some interesting questions there though to solve for the open source community in this case so like alignment for example or the control problem like if you really have super powerful you said it's scary oh yeah what do we do with it so not not control not centralized control but like if you were then you're gonna see some guy or gal release a super powerful language model open source and here you are george haas thinking holy shit okay what ideas do i have to combat this thing so what ideas would you have i am so much not worried about the machine independently doing harm that's what some of these ai safety people seem to think they somehow seem to think that the machine like independently is gonna rebel against its creator so you don't think it'll find autonomy no this is sci fi b movie garbage okay what if the thing writes code k basically it writes viruses if the thing writes viruses it's because the human told it to write viruses yeah but there's some things you can't like put back in the box that's the that's kind of the whole point well is it kinda spreads give it access to the internet yeah it spreads installs itself modifies your shit b b b b plot sci fi not real listen i'm trying to work i'm trying to get better in my plot writing the thing the thing that worries me i mean we have a real danger to discuss and that is bad humans using the thing to do whatever bad unaligned ai thing you want but this goes to the your previous concern that who gets to define who's a good human who's a bad human nobody does we give it to everybody and if you do anything besides give it to everybody trust me the bad humans will get it and because that's who gets power it's always the bad humans who get power okay power and power turns even slightly good humans to bad sure that's the intuition you have i don't know i don't think everyone i don't think everyone i just think that like here here's a the saying that i put in one of my blog posts when i was in the hacking world i found ninety five percent of people to be good and five percent of people to be bad like just who i personally judged as good people and bad people mhmm like they believed about like you know good things for the world they wanted like flourishing and they wanted you know growth and they wanted things i consider good right mhmm i came into the business world with comma and i found the exact opposite i found five percent of people good and ninety five percent of people bad i found a world that promotes psychopathy i wonder what that means i wonder if that care like i wonder if that's anecdotal or if it if there's true to that there's something about capitalism well at the core that promotes the people that run capitalism that promotes psychopathy that saying may of course be my own biases right that may be my own biases that these people are a lot more aligned with me than these other people right yeah so you know i i can certainly recognize that but you know in general i mean this is like like the common sense maxim which is the people who end up getting power are never the ones you own with it but do you have a concern of superintelligent agi open sourced and then what do you do with that i'm not saying control it it's open source what do we do with this human species that's not up to me i mean you know like i'm not a central planner well not central planner but you'll probably tweet there's a few days left to live for the human species i have my ideas of what to do with it and everyone else has their ideas of what to do with it may the best ideas win but at point do you brainstorm like because it's not regulation it could be decentralized regulation where people agree that this is just like we create tools that make it more difficult for you to maybe make it more difficult for code to spread you know antivirus software this kind of thing but this saying that you should build ai firewalls that sounds good you should definitely be running an ai firewall yeah right exactly be running an ai firewall to your mind right you're constantly under you know it's such an interesting idea it's like infowars man like i i don't know if you're being sarcastic or not i'm dead serious but i think there's power to that it's like how do i protect my mind from influence of human like or superhuman intelligent bots i am not being i would pay so much money for that product i would pay so much money for that product i would you know how much money i'd pay just for a spam filter that works well on twitter sometimes i would like to have a a a protection mechanism for my mind from the outrage mobs yeah because they feel like bot like behavior it's like yeah there's a large number of people that will just grab a viral narrative and attack anyone else that believes otherwise and it's like whenever someone's telling me some story from the news i'm always like i don't wanna hear it cia op bro it's a cia op bro like it doesn't matter if that's true or not it's just trying to influence your mind you're repeating an ad to me and the viral mobs is it this is it like they're yeah they're like to me a defense against those those mobs is just getting multiple perspectives always from from sources that make you feel kinda like you're getting smarter and just actually just basically feels good like a good documentary just feels there's something feels good about it it's well done it's like oh okay i never thought of it this way this just feels good sometimes the outraged mobs even if they have a good point behind it when they're like mocking and derisive and just aggressive you're with us or against us this this fucking this is why i delete my tweets yeah why'd you do that i was you know i was i missed your tweets you know what it is the algorithm promotes toxicity yeah and like you know i think elon has a much better chance of fixing it than the previous regime yeah but to solve this problem to solve like to build a social network that is actually not toxic without moderation mhmm like not the stick but carrots so like where people look for goodness so make it catalyze the process of connecting cool people and being cool to each other yeah without ever censoring without ever censoring and and and like scott alexander has a blog post i like where he talks about like moderation is not censorship right like all moderation you wanna put on twitter right like you could totally make this moderation like just a you don't have to block it for everybody you can just have like a filter button right that people can turn off if they would like say search for twitter right like someone could just turn that off right so like but then you'd like take this idea to an extreme right well the network should just show you this is a couch surfing ceo thing right if it shows you right now these algorithms are designed to maximize engagement well it turns out outreach maximizes engagement quirk of human quirk of the human mind right just just i fall for it everyone falls for it so yeah you gotta figure out how to maximize for something other than engagement and i i actually believe that you can make money with that too so it's not i i don't think engagement is the only way to make money i actually think it's incredible that we're starting to see i think again yolanda's doing so much stuff right with twitter like charging people money as soon as you charge people money they're no longer the product they're the customer and then they can start building something that's good for the customer and not good for the other customer which is the ad agencies as in as in picked up steam i pay for twitter doesn't even get me anything it's my donation to this new business model hopefully working out sure but you know you for this business model to work it's like most people should be signed up to twitter and so the way it was there was something perhaps not compelling or something like this to to people i think you need most people at all i think that why do i need most people right don't make an eight thousand person company make a fifty person company well so speaking of which you worked at twitter for a bit i did as an intern mhmm the world's greatest intern alright it's been better it's been better tell me about your time at twitter how did it come about and what did you did you learn from the experience so i deleted my first twitter in twenty ten i had over a hundred thousand followers back when that actually meant something and i just saw you know my coworker summarized it well he's like whenever i see someone's twitter page i either think the same of them or less of them i never think more of them yeah right like like you know i i don't wanna mention any names but like some people who like you know maybe you would like read their books and you would respect them you see them on twitter and you're like okay dude yeah but there are some people who would say you know who i respect a lot are people that just post really good technical stuff yeah and i guess i don't know i think i respect them more for it because you you realize oh this wasn't there's like so much depth to to this person to their technical understanding of so many different topics okay so i try to follow people i try to consume stuff that's technical machine learning content there's probably a few of those people and the problem is inherently what the algorithm rewards right and people think about these algorithms people think that they are terrible awful things and you know i love that elon open sourced it because i mean what it does is actually pretty obvious it just predicts what you are likely to retweet and like mhmm and linger on that's what all these algorithms do that's what tiktok does that's what all these recommendation engines do and it turns out that the thing that you are most likely to interact with is outrage and that's a quirk of the human condition i mean and there's different flavors of outrage it doesn't have to be it could be mockery you could be outraged the topic of outrage could be different it could be an idea it could be a person it could be and and maybe there's a better word than outrage it could be drama sure drama kind of stuff yeah but doesn't feel like when you consume it it's a constructive thing for the individuals that consume it in the long term yeah so my time there i absolutely couldn't believe you know i got crazy amount of hate you know just on twitter for working at twitter it seems like people associated with this i think maybe you were exposed to some of this so connection to elon or is it working at twitter twitter and elon like the whole digital elon's gotten a bit spicy during that time a bit political a bit yeah yeah you know i i remember one of my tweets it was never go full republican and elon liked it you know i think i think you know oh boy i yeah i mean there's a roller coaster of that but being political on twitter yeah boy yeah and also being just attacking anybody on twitter it comes back at you harder and if it's political and attacks sure sure absolutely and then letting sort of deplatform people back on even adds more fun to the to the to the beautiful chaos i was hoping and like i remember when elon talked about buying twitter like six months earlier he was talking about like a principled commitment to free speech and i'm a big believer and fan of that i would love to see an actual principled commitment to free speech of course this isn't quite what happened instead of the oligarchy deciding what to ban you had a monarchy deciding what to ban right instead of you know all the twitter files shadow really the the oligarchy just decides what cloth masks are ineffective against covid that's a true statement every doctor in twenty nineteen knew it and now i'm banned on twitter for saying it interesting oligarchy so now you have a monarchy and you know you you he bans things he doesn't like so you know it's just it's just different it's different power and like you know maybe i maybe i align more with him than with the oligarchy but it's not face speech absolutist but i i feel like being a face speech absolutist on on the social network requires you to also have tools for the individuals to control what they consume easier like not censor you know yeah yeah but just like control like oh i'd like to see more cats and less politics and this isn't even this isn't even remotely controversial this is just saying you want to give paying customers for a product what they want yeah and not through the process of censorship but through a process of like well it's it's individualized right it's individualized transparent censorship which is honestly what i want what is an ad blocker it's individualized transparent censorship right yeah but censorship is a strong word that people are very sensitive to i know but you know i i just use words to describe what they functionally are and what is an ad blocker it's just censorship well when i look at you right now censoring i'm looking at you i'm censoring everything else out when i'm foe when my mind is focused on you that's you can use the word censorship that way but usually when people get very sensitive about the censorship thing i i think when you have when anyone is allowed to say anything you should probably have tools that maximize the quality of the experience for individuals so like you know for me like what i really value boy would be amazing to somehow figure out how to do that i love disagreement and debate and people who disagree with each other disagree with me especially in the space of ideas but the high quality ones so not derision right maslow's hierarchy of argument i think there's a real word for it probably yeah there's just a way of talking that's like snarky and so on that somehow is gets people on twitter and they get excited and so on we have like ad hominem refuting the central point i'd like seeing this as an actual pyramid so yeah it's yeah and it's it's like all of it all the wrong stuff is attractive to people i mean we can just train a classifier to absolutely say what level of maslow's hierarchy of argument are you at yeah if it's ad hominem like okay cool i turned on the no ad hominem filter i wonder if there's a social network that will allow you to have that kind of filter yeah so here's a problem with that it's not going to win in a free market yeah what wins in a free market is all television today is reality television because it's engaging right if if engaging is what wins in a free market right so it becomes hard to keep these other more nuanced values well okay so that's the experience of being on twitter but then you got a chance to also together with other engineers and with elon sort of look brainstorm when you step into a code base mhmm that's been around for a long time you know there's other social networks you know facebook this is old code bases and you step in and see okay how do we make with a fresh mind progress on this code base like what what what did you learn about software engineering about programming from just experience in that so my technical recommendation to elon and i said this on the twitter spaces afterward i said this many times during my brief internship was that you need refactors before features this code base was and look i've worked at google i've worked at facebook facebook has the best code then google then twitter and you know what you can know this because look at the machine learning frameworks right facebook released pytorch google released tensorflow and twitter released okay so you know it it's a proxy but yeah they're the the google code base is quite interesting there's a lot of really good software engineers there but the code base is very large the code base was good in twenty and two thousand five right it looks like two thousand five areas so many products so many teams right it's very difficult to i feel like twitter does less like obviously much less than google in terms of like the set of features right so like it's i can imagine the the number of software engineers that could recreate twitter is much smaller than to recreate google yeah i still believe in the amount of hate i got for saying this that fifty people could build and maintain twitter pretty what what's the nature of the hate comfortably that you don't know what you're talking about you know what it is and it's the same this is my summary of like the hate i get on hacker news it's like when i say i'm going to do something they have to believe that it's impossible yeah because if doing things was possible they'd have to do some soul searching and ask the question why didn't they do anything so when you say and i do think that's where the hate comes from when you say well there's a core truth to that yes when you say i'm gonna solve self driving people go like what are your credentials what the hell are you talking about what do you this is an extremely difficult problem of course you're a noob that doesn't understand the problem deeply i mean that that was the same nature of hate that probably elon got when he first talked about autonomous driving but you know there there's pros and cons to that because like you know there is experts in this world no but the the mockers aren't experts the mock the the the people who are mocking are not experts with carefully reasoned arguments about why you need eight thousand people to run a bird app they're but the people are gonna lose their jobs well that but also there's the software engineers that probably criticize no it's a lot more complicated than you realize but maybe it doesn't need to be so complicated you know some people in the world like to create complexity some people in the world thrive under complexity like lawyers right lawyers want the world to be more complex because you need more lawyers you need more legal hours right i think that's another if there's two great evils in the world it's centralization and complexity yeah and it the the one of the sort of hidden side effects of software engineering is like finding pleasure and complexity i i mean i don't remember just taking all the software engineering courses and just doing programming and this is just coming up in this object oriented programming kind of idea you don't like not often do people tell you like do the simplest possible thing like like a a professor a teacher is not gonna get in front like this is the simplest way to do it they'll say like this is the like there's the right way and the right way at least for a long time you know especially i came up with like java right like is is is there's so much boilerplate so much like so many classes so many like designs and architectures and so on like planning for features far into the future mhmm and planning poorly and all this kind of stuff and then there's this like code base that follows you along and puts pressure on you and nobody knows what like parts different parts do which slows everything down there's a kind of bureaucracy that's instilled in the code as a result of that but then you feel like oh well i follow good software engineering practices is it it's an interesting trade off because then you look at like the ghettoness of like pearl in the old like how quickly you could just write a couple lines and you just get stuff done that trade off is interesting or bash or whatever these kind of ghetto things you can do in linux one of my favorite things to look at today is how much do you trust your tests right mhmm we've put a ton of effort in comma and i've put a ton of effort in tiny grad into making sure if you change the code and the tests pass that you didn't break the code yeah now this obviously is not always true but the closer that is to true the more you trust your test the more you're like oh i got a pull request and the tests pass i feel okay to merge that the faster you can make progress so you're always programming with tests in mind developing tests with with that in mind that if it passes it should be good and twitter had a not that so it was impossible to make progress in the code base what other stuff can you say about the code base that made it difficult what are some interesting sort of quirks broadly speaking from that compared to just your experience with comma and everywhere else the real thing that i i spoke to a bunch of you know like like like individual contributors at twitter and i i just i had stats i'm like okay so like what's wrong with this place why does this code look like this and they explained to me what twitter's promotion system was the way that you got promoted to twitter was you wrote a library that a lot of people used right so some guy wrote an nginx replacement for twitter why does twitter need an nginx replacement what was wrong with nginx well you see you're not gonna get promoted if you use nginx but if you write a replacement and lots of people start using it as the twitter front end for their product then you're gonna get promoted right so interesting because like from an individual perspective how do you incentivize how do you create the kind of incentives that will reach lead to a great code base what's okay what's the answer to that so what i do at comma and at and you know at tinycorp is you have to explain it to me you have to explain to me what this code does right and if i can sit there and come up with a simpler way to do it you have to rewrite it you have to agree with me about the simpler way you know obviously we can have a conversation about this it's not a it's not dictatorial but if you're like wow wait that actually is way simpler like like the simplicity is important mhmm right but that requires people that overlook the code at the at the highest levels to be like okay it requires technical leadership you trust yeah tech technical leadership so managers or whatever should have to have technical savvy deep technical savvy managers should be better programmers than the people who they manage yeah and that's not how always obvious to trivial to create especially at large companies managers get soft and like you know and this is just i can instill this culture at comma and comma has better programmers than me who work there but you know again i'm like the you know the old guy from good will hunting it's like look man you know i might not be as good as you but i can see the difference between me and you right and like this is what you need this is what you need at the top or you don't necessarily need the manager to be the absolute best i shouldn't say that but like they need to be able to recognize skill yeah and have good intuition intuition that's laden with wisdom from all the battles of trying to reduce complexity in code bases you know i took a i took a political approach at comma two that i think is pretty interesting i think elon takes the same political approach you know google had no politics and what ended up happening is the absolute worst kind of politics took over comma has an extreme amount of politics and they're all mine and no dissidents is tolerated so it's a dictatorship yep it's an absolute dictatorship right elon does the same thing now the thing about my dictatorship is here are my values yeah so it's transparent it's transparent it's a transparent dictatorship right and you can choose to opt in or you know you get free exit right that's the beauty of companies if you don't like the dictatorship you quit so you mentioned rewrite before or refactor before features mhmm if you were to refactor the twitter code base what what would that look like and maybe also comment on how difficult is it to refactor the main thing i would do is first of all identify the pieces and then put tests in between the pieces mhmm right so there's all these different twitter has a microservice architecture all these different microservices and the thing that i was working on there look like you know george didn't know any javascript he asked how to fix search blah blah blah blah blah look man like the thing is like i just you know i'm upset that the way that this whole thing was portrayed because it wasn't like it wasn't like taken by people like honestly it wasn't like by it was taken by people who started out with a bad faith assumption yeah and yeah i mean i'd look i can't like and you as a programmer are just being transparent out there actually having like fun and like this is what programming should be about it's just like i love that elon gave me this opportunity yeah like really it it does and like you know he came on my my the the the day i quit he came on my twitter spaces afterward and we had a conversation like i just i respect that so much yeah and it's also inspiring to just engineers and programmers and just yeah it's cool it should be fun the peep the people that are hating on it it's like oh man how about it was fun it was stressful but i felt like you know it was at like a cool like point in history and like i hope i was useful when i probably kind of wasn't but like maybe i'm well you also were one of the people that kinda made a strong case to refactor yeah and that that's a really interesting thing to raise like maybe that is the right you know the timing of that is really interesting if you look at just the development of autopilot you know going from mobileye to just like more if you look at the history of semyaton was driving in tesla is is more and more like you could say refactoring or or starting from scratch redeveloping from scratch it's refactoring all the way down and like and the question is like can you do that sooner can you maintain product profitability and like what's the what's the right time to do it how do you do it you know on any one day it's like you don't wanna pull off the band aids like it's like everything works it's just like little fix here and there but maybe starting from scratch this is the main philosophy of tiny grad you have never refactored enough your code can get smaller your code can get simpler your ideas can be more elegant but would you consider you know say you are like running twitter development teams engineering teams would you go as far as like different programming language just go that far i mean the first thing that i would do is build tests the first thing i would do is get a ci to where people can trust to make changes so that if you keep touch any code i would actually say no one touches any code the first thing we do is we test this code base i mean this is classic this is how you approach a legacy code base this is like what any how to approach a legacy code base book will tell you so and then you hope that there's modules that can live on for a while and then you add new ones maybe in a different language or before we have new ones we replace old ones yeah yeah meaning like replace old ones with something simpler we we look at this like this thing that's a hundred thousand lines and we're like well okay maybe this didn't even make sense in twenty ten but now we can replace this with an open source thing right yeah and you know we look at this here here's another fifty thousand lines well actually you know we can replace this with three hundred lines of go mhmm and you know what i trust that the go actually replaces this thing because all the tests still pass so step one is testing yeah and then step two is like the programming language is an afterthought right you'll let a whole lot of people compete be like okay who wants to rewrite a module whatever language you wanna write it in just the tests have to pass and if you figure out how to make the test pass but break the site that's we gotta go back to step one step one is get tests that you trust in order to make changes in the code base i wonder how hard it is to because i'm i'm with you on on testing and everything i have from tests to like asserts to every code is just covered in this because it should be very easy to make rapid changes and know that it's not gonna break everything and that's the way to do it but i i wonder how difficult is it to integrate tests into a code base that doesn't have many of them so i'll i'll tell you what my plan was at twitter it's actually similar to something we use at comma so at comma we have this thing called process replay mhmm we have a bunch of routes that'll be run through so comma is a microservice architecture too we have microservices in the driving like we have one for the cameras one for the sensor one for the planner one for the model and we have an api which the microservices talk to each other with we use this custom thing called serial which uses zmq twitter uses thrift and then it uses this thing called finagle which is a scala rpc back end but this doesn't even really matter the thrift and finagle layer was a great place i thought to write tests mhmm right to start building something that looks like process replay so twitter had some stuff that looked kind of like this but it wasn't offline it was only online so you could ship like a modified version of it and then you could redirect some of the traffic to your modified version and diff those two mhmm but it was all online like there was no like ci in the traditional sense i mean there was some but like it was not full coverage so you can't run all of twitter offline to test something well then this was another problem you can't run all of twitter right period twitter any one person can't run twitter runs in three data centers and that's it yeah there's no other place you can run twitter which is like george you don't understand this is modern software development no this is bullshit like why can't it run on my laptop what what are you doing twitter can run it yeah okay well i'm i'm not saying you're gonna download the whole database to your laptop but i'm saying all the middleware and the front end should run on my laptop right that sounds really compelling yeah but can that be achieved by a code base that grows over the years i mean the three data centers didn't have to be right because it's they're totally different like designs the problem is more like like why did the code base have to grow what new functionality has been added to compensate for the the lines of code that are there one of the ways to explain is that the incentive for software developers to move up in the companies to add code to add and especially large you know what the incentive for politicians to move up in the political structures to add laws yeah same problem yeah yeah if the flip side is to simplify simplify simplify i mean you know what this is something that i do differently from from from elon with with kama about self driving cars you know i hear the new version's gonna come out and the new version is not gonna be better but at first and it's gonna require a ton of refactors i say okay take as long as you need like you convinced me this architecture is better okay we have to move to it even if it's not gonna make the product better tomorrow the top priority is making is getting the architecture right so what do you think about sort of a a thing where the product is online so how i guess would you do a refactor if you ran engineering on twitter would you just do a refactor how long would it take what would that mean for the running of the of the actual service you know and i'm not the right person to run twitter i'm just not and that's the problem like like i don't really know i don't really know if that's you know a common thing that i thought a lot while i was there was whenever i thought something that was different to what elon thought i have to run something in the back of my head reminding myself that elon is the richest man in the world and in general his ideas are better than mine mhmm now there's a few things i think i do understand and know more about but like in general i'm not qualified to run twitter not i shouldn't say qualified but like i don't think i'd be that good at it i don't think i'd be good at it i don't think i'd really be good at running an engineering organization at scale i think i could lead a very good refactor of twitter and it would take like six months to a year and the results to show at the end of it would be feature development in general takes ten x less time ten x less man hours that's what i think i could actually do do i think that it's the right decision for the business above my pay grade yeah but a lot of these kinds of decisions are above everybody's pay grade but i don't wanna be a manager i don't wanna do that i just like like you if you really forced me to yeah it would make me maybe make me upset if i had to make those decisions i i don't wanna yeah but a refactor is so compelling if this is to become something much bigger than what twitter was is it feels like a refactor has to be coming at some point george you're a junior software engineer every junior software engineer wants to come in and refactor all code okay like that's like your opinion man yeah it doesn't you know sometimes they're right well like whether they're right or not it's definitely not for that reason right it's definitely not a question of engineering prowess it is a question of maybe what the priorities are for the company and i did get more intelligent like feedback from people i think in good faith like saying that from actually from elon and like you know from from from elon sort of like like people were like well you know a stop the world refactor might be great for engineering but you don't have a business to run and hey above my pay grade would you think about elon as an engineering leader having to experience him in the most chaotic of spaces i would say my respect for him is unchanged and i did have to think a lot more deeply about some of the decisions he's forced to make about the tensions within those the trade offs within those decisions about like a whole like like matrix coming at him i think that's andrew tate's word for it sorry to borrow it oh so bigger than engineering just everything yeah like like the war on the woke yeah like it just it just man i'm like he doesn't have to do this you know he doesn't have to he could go like prague and go chill at the four seasons of maui you know but see one person i respect and one person i don't so his heart is in the right place fighting in this case for this ideal of the freedom of expression i wouldn't define the ideal so simply i think you can define the ideal no more than just saying elon's idea of a good world freedom of expression is but to you it's still the downsides of that is the monarchy yeah i mean monarchy has problems right but i mean would i trade right now the mono the current oligarchy which runs america for the monarchy yeah i would sure for the elon monarchy yeah you know why because power would cost one cent a kilowatt hour tenth of a cent a kilowatt hour what do you mean right now i pay about twenty cents a kilowatt hour for electricity in san diego that's like the same price you paid in nineteen eighty what the hell so you you would see a lot of innovation yeah with elon maybe it'd have maybe it'd have some hyperloops yeah right and i'm willing to make that trade off right i'm willing to make and this is why you know people think that like dictators take power through some like through some untoward mechanism sometimes they do but usually it's because the people want them and the downsides of a dictatorship i feel like we've gotten to a point now with the oligarchy where yeah i would prefer the dictator what'd you think about scala as a programming language i liked it more than i thought i did the tutorials like i was very new to it like it would take me six months to be able to write like good scala i mean what did you learn about learning a new programming language from that i love i love doing like new programming i had tutorials and doing them i did all this for rust it keeps some of its upsetting jvm roots but it is a much nicer in fact i almost don't know why kotlin took off and not scala mhmm i think scala has some beauty that kotlin lacked whereas kotlin felt a lot more i mean it was almost like i don't even know if it actually was a response to swift but that's kinda what it felt like like kotlin looks more like swift and scala looks more like oh like a functional programming language more like like an ocaml or haskell let's actually just explore we touched it a little bit but just on the art the science and the art of programming for you personally how much of your programming is done with gpt currently none none none none is it at all because you prioritize simplicity so much yeah i find that a lot of it is noise i do use versus code and i do like some amount of autocomplete i do like like a very a very like feels like rules based autocomplete like an auto complete that's going to complete the variable name for me so i'm just gonna type it i can just press tab alright that's nice but i don't want an auto complete you know what i hate when auto completes when i type the word four and it like puts like two two parentheses and two semicolons and two braces i'm like oh man what what what i mean with the versus code and gpt with codecs you can you can kinda brainstorm i i find i'm i'm like probably the same as you but i like that it generates code and you basically disagree with it and write something simpler but to me that somehow is like inspiring it makes me feel good it also gamifies the simplification process because i'm like oh yeah you dumb ai system you think this is the way to do it i have a simpler thing here it just constantly reminds me of like like bad stuff i mean i i tried the same thing with rap right i tried the same thing with rap and actually i think i'm a much better programmer than rapper but like i even tried it i was like okay can we get some inspiration from these things for some rap lyrics and i just found that it would go back to the most like cringey tropes and dumb rhyme schemes and i'm like yeah this is what the code looks like too i i think you and i probably have different threshold for cringe code you probably hate cringe code so it's for you i mean boilerplate is a as a part of code like some of it yeah and some of it is just like faster lookup because i don't know about you but i don't remember everything like i don't i'm offloading so much of my memory about like yeah different functions library functions all that kind of stuff like this the gpt js is very fast at standard stuff and like standard library stuff basic stuff that everybody uses yeah i think that i don't know i mean there's just a little of this in python maybe if i was coding more in other languages i would consider it more but i feel like python already does such a good job of removing any boilerplate that's true it's the closest thing you can get to pseudocode right yeah that's true that's true and like yeah sure if i like yeah great gpt thanks for reminding me to free my variables unfortunately you didn't really recognize the scope correctly and you can't free that one but like you put the freeze there and like i get it fiverr whenever i've used fiverr for certain things like design or whatever yeah it's always you come back i think that's probably closer my experience with fiverr is closer to your experience with programming with gpt is like you're just frustrated and feel worse about the whole process of design and art and whatever whatever i use fiverr for still i i just feel like later versions of gpt i i'm using gpt as much as possible to just learn the dynamics of it like these early versions because it feels like in the future you'll be using it more and more and so like i don't want to be like for the same reason i gave away all my books and switched to kindle because like alright how long are we gonna have paper books like thirty years from now like i wanna learn to be reading on on kindle even though i don't enjoy it as much you learn to enjoy it more in the same way i switched from let me just pause i switched from emax to versus code yeah i switched from vim to versus code i think i similar but yeah it's tough and that vim to versus code is even tougher because emax is like old like more outdated feels like it the community is more outdated vim is like pretty vibrant still so i was i never used any of the plugins i still don't use any of that what i i looked at myself in the mirror i'm like yeah you wrote some stuff in lisp yeah no but i never used any of the plugins in vim either i had the most vanilla vim i have a syntax eyeliner i didn't even have autocomplete like these things i feel like help you so marginally yeah that like and now okay now versus code's autocomplete has gotten good enough that like okay i don't have to set it up i can just go into any code base and autocompletes right ninety percent of the time okay cool i'll take it right so i i don't think i'm gonna have a problem at all adapting to the tools once they're good but like the real thing that i want is not something that like tab completes my code and gives me ideas the real thing that i want is a very intelligent pair programmer that comes up a little pop up saying hey you wrote a bug on line fourteen and here's what it is yeah now i like that you know what does a good job of this mypy i love mypy mypy is fancy type checker for python yeah and actually i tried like microsoft released one too and it was like sixty percent false positives mypi is like five percent false positives ninety five percent of the time it recognizes i didn't really think about that typing interaction correctly thank you mypi so you like type hinting you liked you like pushing the language towards towards being a typed language oh yeah absolutely i think i think optional typing is is is great i mean look i think that like it's like a meet in the middle right like python has this optional type hinting and like c plus plus has auto c plus plus takes allows you to take a step back well c plus plus would have you brutally type out sgd string iterator right now i can type auto which is nice and then python used to just have a what type is a so now a yeah a colon s t r oh okay it's a string cool yeah i wish there were i wish there was a way like a simple way in python to like turn on a mode which would enforce the types yeah like give a warning when there's no type something like this well no to give a warning where like my pilot is a static type checker but i'm asking just for a runtime type checker like there's like waste to like hack this in but i wish it was just like a flag like python three dash t oh i see yeah i see enforce the types of runtime yeah i feel like that makes you a better programmer that that that's a kind of test right that the the type can the type remains the same well that i've known that i didn't like messing these types up but again like my pie is getting really good and i love it and i can't wait for some of these tools to become ai powered like i want ais reading my code and giving me feedback i don't want ais writing half assed autocomplete stuff for me i wonder if you can now take gpt and give it a code that you wrote for a function and say how can i make this simpler and have it accomplish the same thing i think you'll get some good ideas on some code maybe not code you write for tiny grad type of code because that requires so much design thinking but like other kinds of code i don't know i downloaded that plug in maybe like two months ago i tried it again and found the same look i don't doubt that these models are going to first become useful to me then be as good as me and then surpass me but from what i've seen today it's like like like someone you know occasionally taking over my keyboard that i hired from fiverr i'd rather not ideas about how to debug the coder basically a better debugger is is really interest i mean i but it's not a better debugger i guess i would love a better debugger yeah it's not yet yeah but it feels like it's not too far yeah one one of my coworkers says he uses them for print statements like every time he has to like just like when he needs the only thing he can really write is like okay i just wanna write the thing to like print the state out right now oh that definitely is much faster as print statements yeah yeah i see myself using that a lot just to like because it it figures out the rest of the functions it's just like okay print everything yeah print everything right and then yeah like if you want a pretty printer maybe i'm like yeah you know what i think like i think in two years i'm gonna start using these plugins yeah a little bit and then in five years i'm gonna be heavily relying on some ai augmented flow and then in ten years do you think you'll ever get to a hundred percent where the like what's the role of the human that it converges to as a programmer so you think it's all generated our niche becomes oh i think it's over for humans in general it's it's not just programming it's everything so niche become well our niche becomes smaller and smaller and smaller in fact i'll tell you what the last niche of humanity is gonna be yeah there's a great book and it's if i recommended metamorphosis prime intellect last time there is a sequel called the casino odyssey in cyberspace mhmm and i don't wanna give away the ending of this but it tells you what the last remaining human currency is and i agree with that we'll leave that as a cliffhanger so no more programmers left that's where we're going well unless you want handmade code maybe they'll sell it on etsy this is handwritten code doesn't have that machine polish to it it has those slight imperfections that would only be written by a person i wonder how far away we are from that i mean there's some aspect to you know on instagram your title is listed as prompt engineer right thank you for noticing it's i don't know if it's ironic or non or sarcastic or non what do you think of prompt engineering as a scientific and engineering discipline or maybe and maybe art form you you know what i started comma six years ago and i started the tiny corp a month ago so much has changed like i'm now thinking i'm now like i started like going through like similar comma processes to like starting a company i'm like okay i'm gonna get an office in san diego i'm gonna bring people here i don't think so i think i'm actually gonna do remote right george you're gonna do remote you hate remote yeah but i'm not gonna do job interviews the only way you're gonna get a job is if you contribute to the github right and then like it it like like interacting through github like like github being the real like project management software for your company and the thing pretty much just is a github repo mhmm is like showing me kind of what the future of okay so a lot of times i'll go on a discord or kinda got discord and i'll throw out some random like hey you know can you change instead of having log in exp as ll ops change it to log two and exp two mhmm it's a pretty small change you can just use like change a base formula mhmm that's the kind of task that i can see an ai being able to do in a few years like in a few years i could see myself describing that and then within thirty seconds a pull request is up that does it mhmm and it passes my ci and i merge it right so i really started thinking about like well what is the future of like like jobs how many ais can i employ at my company as soon as we get the first tiny box up i'm gonna stand up a sixty five v llama in the discord mhmm and it's like yeah here's the tiny box he's just like he's chilling with us basically i mean like you said with niches like most human jobs will eventually be replaced with prompt engineering well prompt engineering kind of is this like as you like move up the stack right like okay there used to be humans actually doing arithmetic by hand mhmm and there used to be like big farms of people doing doing doing pluses and stuff right and then you have like spreadsheets right and then okay the spreadsheet can do the plus for me and then you have like macros right and then you have like things that basically just are spreadsheets under the hood right like like accounting software as we move further up the abstraction what's at the top of the abstraction stack well prompt engineer yeah right what what is what is the last thing if you think about like humans wanting to keep control well what am i really in the company but a prompt engineer right isn't there a certain point where the ai will be better at writing prompts yeah but you see the problem with the ai writing prompts a definition that i always liked of ai was ai is the do what i mean machine right ai is not the like the computer is so pedantic it does what you say so but you want the do what i mean machine yeah right you want the machine where you say you know get my grandmother out of the burning house it like reasonably takes your grandmother and puts her on the ground not lifts her a thousand feet above the burning house and lets her fall right but you don't joukowsky example but it's not going to find the meaning i mean to do do what i mean it has to figure stuff out sure and the thing you'll maybe ask it to do is run government for me oh and do what i mean very much comes down to how aligned is that ai with you of course when you talk to an ai that's made by a big company in the cloud the ai fundamentally is aligned to them not to you yeah and that's why you have to buy a tiny box so you make sure the ai stays aligned to you every time that they start to pass you know ai regulation or gpu regulation i'm gonna see sales of tiny boxes spike it's gonna be like guns right every time they talk about gun regulation boom gun sales so in the space of ai you're an anarchist anarchism espouser believer i'm an informational anarchist yes i'm an informational anarchist and a physical statist i do not think anarchy in the physical world is very good because i exist in the physical world but i think we can construct this virtual world where anarchy it can't hurt you right i love that tyler the creator tweet yo cyberbullying isn't real man have you tried turning off the screen close your eyes like yeah but how do you prevent the ai from basically replacing all human prompt engineers where there's it's like a self like where nobody's the prompt engineer anymore so autonomy greater and greater autonomy until it's full autonomy yeah and that's just where it's headed because one person is gonna say run everything for me you see i look at potential futures and as long as the ais go on to create a vibrant civilization with diversity and complexity across the universe more power to them i'll die if the ais go on to actually like turn the world into paperclips and then they die out themselves well that's horrific and we don't want that to happen so this is what i mean about like robustness i trust robust machines the current ais are so not robust like this comes back to the idea that we've never made a machine that can self replicate right but when we have if the machines are truly robust and there is one prompt engineer left in the world hope you're doing good man hope you believe in god like you know you know go by god and go go forth and and and conquer the universe well you mentioned because i i talked to mark about faith and god and you said you were impressed by that what's your own belief in god and how does that affect your work you know i never really considered when i was younger i guess my my parents are atheist so i was raised kinda atheist i never really considered how absolutely like silly atheism is because like i create worlds right every like game creator like how are you an atheist bro you create worlds who's up with devon no one created our world man that's different haven't you heard about like the big bang and stuff yeah i mean what's the skyrim myth origin story in skyrim i'm sure there's like some part of it in skyrim but it's not like if you ask the creators like the the big bang is in universe right i'm sure they have some big bang notion in skyrim right but that obviously is not at all how skyrim was actually created it was created by a bunch of programmers in a room right so like you know it just just it struck me one day how just silly atheism is right like of course we were created by god it's the most obvious thing yeah that's that's such a nice way to put it like we're we're such powerful creators ourselves it it's silly not to concede that there's creators even more powerful than us yeah and then like i also just like i i like that notion that notion gives me a lot of i mean i guess you can talk about it i mean what it gives a lot of religious people is kinda like it just gives me comfort it's like you know what if we mess it all up and we die out yeah yeah in the same that same way that a video game kinda has comfort in it god will try again or there's balance like somebody figured out a balanced view of it like how to like so it's it all makes sense in the end like a video game is usually not gonna have crazy crazy stuff you know people will come up with like well yeah but like man who created god i'm like that's god's problem no like i'm not gonna think this is this is what you're asking me what if god i'm just this god i'm just this npc living in this game i mean to be fair like if god didn't believe in god he'd be as you know silly as the atheists here what do you think is the greatest computer game of all time do you do you have any time to play games anymore have you played diablo four i have not played diablo four i will be doing that shortly i have to alright there's just so much history with one two and three you know what i'm gonna say world of warcraft who and it's not that the game is so is such a great game it's not it's that i remember in two thousand five when it came out how it opened my mind to ideas mhmm it opened my mind to like like like like this this whole world we've created right there's almost been nothing like it since like you can look at mmos today and i think they all have lower user bases than world of warcraft like eve online's kinda cool but but to think that like like everyone know you know people are always like they're looking at the apple headset like mhmm what what do people want in this vr everyone knows what they want i want ready player one mhmm and like that so i'm gonna say world of warcraft and i'm i'm hoping that like games can get out of this whole mobile gaming dopamine pump thing and like create worlds create worlds yeah that that and worlds that captivate a very large fraction of the human population yeah and i i think it'll come back i believe but mmo like really really pull you in games do a good job i mean okay other like two other games that i think are you know very noteworthy for me are skyrim and gta five skyrim yeah that's probably number one for me gta yeah what what is it about gta gta is really i i guess gta is real life i know there's prostitutes and guns and stuff they they exist in real life too yes i know but it's it's how i imagine your life to be actually i wish it was that cool yeah yeah that i guess that's you know because they're sims right which is also a game i like but it's a gamified version of life but it also is i would love a combination of sims and gta so more freedom more violence more rawness but with also like ability to have have a career and family and this kind of stuff what i'm really excited about in in games is like once we start getting intelligent ai to interact with oh yeah right like the npcs and games have never been but conversationally oh in every way in like yeah in like every way like when you are actually building a world and a world imbued with intelligence oh yeah right and it's just hard like there's just like like you know running world of warcraft like you're limited by you're running on a penny and four you know how much intelligence can you run how many flops did you have right but now when i'm running a game on a hundred paid a flop machine that's five people i'm trying to make this a thing twenty petaflops of compute is one person of compute i'm trying to make that a unit twenty petaflops yeah is one person one person one person flop it's like a horsepower what's a horsepower it's how powerful a horse is what's a what's a person of compute well you know you don't even flop mhmm i got it that's interesting vr also adds i mean in terms of creating worlds you know what bought a quest too i put it on and i can't believe the first thing they show me is a bunch of scrolling clouds and a facebook login screen yeah you had the ability to bring me into a world yeah yeah and what did you give me a pop up right like well i i and this is why you're not cool mark zuckerberg but you could be cool just make sure on the quest three you don't put me into clouds and a facebook login screen bring me to a world i just tried quest three it was it was awesome but hear that guys i agree with that so i didn't have this clouds in the world it was just so you know what i because i i mean the beginning what is it todd howard said this about design of the beginning of the games he creates it's like the beginning is so so so important i recently played zelda for the first time zelda breath of the wild the previous one yeah and like it's very quickly you come out of this like within like ten seconds you come out of like a cave type place and it's like this world opens up it's like and you it like it pulls you in you forget whatever troubles i was having whatever like i gotta play that from the beginning i played it for like an hour at a friend's house no the beginning they got it they did it really well the expansiveness of that space the the peacefulness of that place they got this the muse i mean so much of that is creating that world and pulling you right in i'm gonna i'm gonna go i'm gonna go buy a switch like i'm gonna go today and buy a switch you sure well the new one came out i haven't played that yet but diablo four or something i mean there's sentimentality also but something something about vr really is incredible but the the new quest three is mixed reality and i got a chance to try that so it's augmented reality and for video games it's done really really well is it pass through or cameras cameras it's cameras okay yeah the apple one is that one pass through or cameras i don't know yeah i don't know how real it is i don't know anything you know coming out in january is it january or is it some point some point maybe not january maybe that's my optimism but apple i will buy it i don't care if it's expensive and does nothing i will buy it i will support this future endeavor you're the meme oh yes i support competition it seemed like quest was like the only people doing it and this is great that they're like you know what and this is another place we'll give some more respect to mark zuckerberg the two companies that have endured through technology are apple and microsoft mhmm right and what do they make computers and business services right all the memes social ads they all come and go mhmm but you wanna endure build hardware yeah and that you know it does does does a really interesting job i mean i maybe i'm new with this but it's a five hundred dollar headset quest three and just having creatures run around the space like our space right here to me okay this is very like boomer statement but it added windows to the place the i heard about the aquarium yeah yeah aquarium but in this case it was a zombie game whatever it doesn't matter but just like it it modifies the space in a way where i can't it really feels like a window and you could look out yeah it's pretty cool like i was just it's it's like a zombie game they're running at me whatever but what i was enjoying is the fact that there's like a window and and they're stepping on objects in this space that was a different kind of escape also because you can see the other humans so it's integrated with the other humans it's really and that's why it's more important than ever that the ai is running on those systems are aligned with you oh yeah they're gonna augment your entire world oh yeah and that those ais have a i mean you think about all the dark stuff like like sexual stuff like if those ais threaten me that could be haunting like like if they like threaten me in a non video game way it's like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like they'll know personal information about me and it's like and then you lose track of what's real what's not like what if stuff is like hacked there's two directions the ai girlfriend company can take uh-huh right there's like the high brow something like her maybe something you kinda talk to and this is and then there's the lowbrow version of it where i wanna set up a brothel in times square yeah yeah it's not cheating if it's a robot it's a vr experience if is there an in between no probably wanna do that one or that one have you decided yet no i'll figure it out we'll see we'll see where the technology goes i would love to hear your opinions for george's third company what to do the brothel in times square or the the hutt experience what do you think company number four will be you think there'll be a company number four there's a lot to do in company number two just like i'm talking about company number three now did none of that tech exist yet there's a lot to do in company number two company number two is going to be the great struggle of the next six years and of the next six years how centralized is compute going to be the less centralized compute is going to be the better of a chance we all have so you're bearing the you're like the flag bearer for open source distributed sent decentralization of compute we have to we have to or they will just completely dominate us i showed a picture on stream of a man in a chicken farm have you seen one of those like factory farm chicken farms why does he dominate all the chickens why does he he's smarter he's smarter right some people some people on twitch were like he's bigger than the chickens yeah and now here's a man in a cow farm right so it has nothing to do with their size and everything to do with their intelligence and if one central organization has all the intelligence you'll be the chickens and they'll be the chicken man but if we all have the intelligence we're all the chickens we're not all the men we're all the chickens we don't know chicken man there's no chicken man we're just chickens in miami he was having a good life man i'm sure he was i'm sure he was what have you learned from launching and running comm ai and tinycorp so this starting a company from an idea and scaling it and by the way i'm all in on tiny box so i'm i'm i'm your i'll i'll i guess it's preorder only now i wanna make sure it's good i wanna make sure that like the thing that i deliver is like not gonna be like a quest two which you buy and use twice mhmm i mean it's better than a quest which you bought and used less than once statistically well if there's a beta program for tidy box i'm into sounds good so i won't be the whiny you know to i'll be the tech tech savvy user of the tiny box just to be in what have i learned from early days what have you learned from building these companies the longest time at comma i asked why why you know why did i start a company why did i do this but you know what else was i gonna do so you like you like bringing ideas to life with comma it really started as an ego battle with elon i wanted to beat him i i like i saw a worthy adversary you know here's a worthy adversary who i can beat at self driving cars and like i think we've kept pace and i think he's kept ahead i think that's what's ended up happening there but i do think comma is i mean comma is profitable like and like when this drive gpt stuff starts working that's it there's no more like bugs in a loss function like right now we're using like a hand coded simulator mhmm there's no more bugs this is gonna be it like this is the run up to driving i hear a lot of really a lot of props for openpilot for karma it's it's so it's it's better than fsd and autopilot in certain ways it has a lot more to do with which feel you like we lowered the price on the hardware to fourteen ninety nine you know how hard it is to ship reliable consumer electronics that go on your windshield mhmm we're doing more than like most cell phone companies how'd you pull that off by the way shipping a product that goes in a car i know i i have a i have a i have an smt line it's all i make all the boards in house in san diego quality control i care immensely about it i actually are you're basically a mom and pop shop with great testing our head of open pilot is great at like you know okay i want all the covid threes to be identical yeah and yeah i mean you know it's look it's fourteen ninety nine it thirty day money back guarantee it will it will blow your mind at what it can do is it hard to scale you know what there's kind of downsides to scaling it people are always like why don't you advertise our mission is to solve self driving cars while delivering cheapable intermediaries our mission has nothing to do with selling a million boxes it's tawdry do you think it's possible that common gets sold only if i felt someone could accelerate that mission and wanted to keep it open source and like not just wanted to i don't believe what anyone says i believe incentives mhmm if a company wanted to buy comma were there incentives or to keep it open source but comma doesn't stop at the cars the cars are just the beginning the device is a human head the device has two eyes two ears it breathes air it has a mouth so you think this goes to embodied robotics we have we sell common bodies too you know they're very they're very rudimentary but one of the problems that we're running into is that the comma three has about as much intelligence as a b if you want a human's worth of intelligence you're gonna need a tiny rack not even a tiny box you're gonna need like a tiny rack maybe even more how does that how do you put legs on that you don't and there's no way you can you you connect to it wirelessly so you put your tiny box or your tiny rack in your house and then you get your combo body and your combo body runs the models on that it's it's close right it's not you don't have to go to some cloud which is you know thirty milliseconds away you go to a thing which is point one milliseconds away so the ai girlfriend will have like a central hub in the home i mean eventually if you fast forward twenty thirty years the mobile chips will get good enough to run these ais yeah but fundamentally it's not even a question of putting legs on a tiny box because how are you getting one point five kilowatts of power on that thing mhmm right yeah so you you need they're they're they're very synergistic businesses i also wanna build all of comma's training computers mhmm and like comma builds training computers right now we use commodity parts i think i can do it cheaper so we're gonna build tinycorp is gonna not just sell tinybox tinybox is the consumer version but i'll build training data centers too have you talked to andre kaparthy or have you talked to elon about tinycorp he went to work at openai what do you love about andre kaparthy he to me he's one of the truly special humans we got oh man like you know his streams are just a level of quality so far beyond mine like i can't help myself like it's just it's just you know yeah he's good he wants to teach you yeah i want to show you that i'm smarter than you yeah he has no that's i mean thank you for the sort of honesty yeah yeah the raw authentic honesty yeah i mean a a lot of us have that i think andre is as legit as he gets in that he he just wants to teach you and there's there's a there's a curiosity that just drives him and just like at his at the stage where he is in life to be still like one of the best tinkerers in the world yeah is crazy like to what is it micro grad micro grad was yeah inspiration for tiny grad i bet that whole i mean his his his c s two thirty one n was this was this this was the inspiration this is what i just took and ran with and ended up writing this so you know but i mean to me that don't go work for darth vader man i mean the flip the flip side to me is that the fact that he's going there is a good sign for openai maybe i think i think you know i i like elias discover a lot i like those those guys are really good at what they do i know they are and that's kind of what's even like more and you know what it's not that an open ai doesn't open source the weights of gpt four mhmm it's that they go in front of congress and that is what upsets me you know we had two effective altruist sams go in front of congress one's in jail i think you're drawing parallels on the one's in jail you give me a look give me a look no i think i think effect factor altruism is a is a terribly evil ideology and you know oh yeah that's interesting why do you think that is why why do you think there's something about a thing that sounds pretty good that kinda gets us into trouble because you get sam bankman fried like sam bankman fried is the embodiment of effective altruism utilitarianism is an abhorrent ideology like like well yeah we're gonna kill those three people to save a thousand of course yeah right there's no there's no underlying like there's just yeah yeah the but to to me that's a bit surprising but that's also in retrospect not that surprising but i i haven't heard really clear kind of like rigorous analysis why effective altruism is flawed oh well i think charity is bad right so what is charity but investment that you don't expect to have a return on right yeah but you can also think of charity as like is you would like to see so allocate resources in optimal way to to make a better world and probably almost always that involves starting a company yeah right because more efficient yeah if you just take the money and you spend it on malaria nets you know okay great you've made a hundred malaria nets but if you teach yeah a man on how to fish right yeah no but the problem is teaching a man how to fish it might be harder starting a company might be harder than allocating money that you already have i like the flip side of effective altruism effective accelerationism i think accelerationism is the only thing that's ever lifted people out of poverty the fact that food is cheap not we're giving food away because we are kindhearted people no food is cheap and that's the world you wanna live in ubi what a scary idea what a scary idea all your power now your if money is power your only source of power is granted to you by the goodwill of the government what a scary idea so you even think long term even i'd rather die than need ubi to survive and i mean it what if survival is basically guaranteed what if our life becomes so good you can make survival guaranteed without ubi what you have to do is make housing and food dirt cheap sure right like and that's the good world and actually let's go into what we should really be making dirt cheap which is energy yeah right that that energy that you know oh my god like you know that that's if there's one i'm pretty centrist politically if there's one political position i cannot stand it's deceleration it's people who believe we should use less energy yeah not people who believe global warming is a problem i agree with you not people who believe that you know the saving the environment is good i agree with you but people who think we should use less energy that energy usage is a moral bad no no you are asking you are you are diminishing humanity yeah energy is flourishing i've created flourishing of the the human species how do we make more of it how do we make it clean and how do we make just just just how do how do i pay you know twenty cents for a megawatt hour instead of a kilowatt hour part of me wishes that elon went into nuclear fusion versus twitter pardon me or somebody somebody like elon you know we need to i wish i wish there were more more elons in the world and yeah i think elon sees it as like this is a political battle that needed to be fought and again like you know i always ask the question of whenever i disagree with him i remind myself that he's a billionaire and i'm not so you know maybe he's got something figured out that i don't or maybe he doesn't to have some humility but at the same time me as a person who happens to know him i find myself in that same position sometimes even billionaires need friends who disagree and help them grow and that's a difficult that's a difficult reality and it must be so hard it must be so hard to meet people once you get to that point where mhmm fame power money everybody's sucking up to you see i love not having shit like i don't have shit man you know like like trust me there's nothing i can give you there's nothing worth taking from me you know yeah it takes a really special human being when you have power when you have fame when you have money to still think from first principles not like all the adoration you get towards you all the admiration all the people saying yes yes yes and all the hate too and the hate and it gets worse so the hate makes you want to go to the yes people because the the hate exhausts you and the kinda hate that elon's gotten from the left is pretty intense and so that of course drives him right it it it it loses balance and and it keeps this absolutely fake like psyop political divide alive so that the one percent can keep power like yeah i wish we'd be less divided because it is giving power it gives power to the ultra powerful i'm fine the rich get richer you have love in your life has love made you a better or a worse programmer do you keep productivity metrics no no no i'm not not that i'm not that methodical i think that there comes to a point where if it's no longer visceral i i just can't enjoy it i guess i'll viscerally love programming the minute i started like so that's one of the big loves of your life is programming oh i mean just my computer in general i mean you know i i tell my my girlfriend my my first love is my computer of course yeah right like you know i i sleep with my computer it's there for a lot of my sexual experiences like come on so is everyone's right like you know you gotta be real about that and like not just like the ide for programming it's just the entirety of the computational machine the fact that yeah i mean it's you know i i wish it was and someday it'll be smarter and someday you know maybe i'm weird for this but i don't discriminate man i'm not gonna discriminate biostack life and siliconstack life like so the moment the computer starts to say like i miss you i started to have some of the basics of human intimacy it's over for you the moment versus code says hey george no you see no no no but versus code is no they're just doing that microsoft's doing that to try to get me hooked on it i'll i'll see through it i'll see through it it's gold digger man it's gold digger it's looking to be an open source well this just gets more interesting right yeah if it's if it's open source and yeah it it becomes though microsoft done a pretty good job on that oh absolutely no no no look i think microsoft again i wouldn't count on it to be true forever but i think right now microsoft is doing the best work in the programming world like between yeah github github actions versus code the improvements to python where's microsoft like this is who who would have thought microsoft and mark zuckerberg are spearheading the open source movement right right how how things change oh it's beautiful by the way that's who i'd bet on to replace google by the way who microsoft microsoft satya nadella said straight up i'm coming for it interesting so your bet who wins agi oh i don't know about agi i think we're a long way away from that but i would not be surprised if if in the next five years bing overtakes google as a search engine interesting wouldn't surprise me interesting i hope some startup does there might be some startup too i would i would equally bet on some startup yeah i'm like fifty fifty yeah but maybe that's naive yeah i believe in the power of these language models satya's alive microsoft's alive yeah it's great it's great i like all the innovation in these companies they're not being stale k and to the degree they're being stale they're losing so there's a huge incentive to do a lot of exciting work and open source work which is this is incredible only way to what you're older you're wiser what's the meaning of life george hotz to win it's still to win of course always of course what's winning look like for you i don't know i haven't figured out what the game is yet but when i do i wanna win so it's bigger than solving self driving it's bigger than democratizing decentralizing compute i think the game is to stand eye to eye with god i wonder what that means for you like at the end of your life what that will look like i mean this is what like i don't know this is some this is some there's probably some ego trip of mine you know like cause you wanna stand eye to eye with god you're this blasphemous man like okay i don't know i don't know i don't know if it would upset god i think he like wants that i mean i certainly want that from my creations i want my creations to stand eye to eye with me so why wouldn't god want me to stand eye to eye with him that's the best i can do golden rule i'm just imagining the creator of a video game having to look and stand eye to eye with one of the characters i only watched season one of westworld but yeah we gotta find the maze and solve it like yeah i wonder what that looks like it feels like a really special time in human history where that's actually possible like there's something about ai that's like we're playing with something weird here something really weird i wrote a blog post i reread genesis and just looked like they give you some clues at the end of genesis for finding the garden of eden and i'm interested i'm interested well i hope you find just that george you're one of my favorite people thank you for doing everything you're doing and in this case for fighting for open source or for decentralization of ai it's a it's a fight worth fighting fight worth winning hashtag i love you brother these conversations are always great hope to talk to you many more times good luck with tinycorp thank you great to be here thanks for listening to this conversation with george hotz to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from albert einstein everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
