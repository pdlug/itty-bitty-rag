the following is a conversation with paul rosalie his second time in the podcast but this time we did the conversation deep in the amazon jungle i traveled there to hang out with paul and it turned out to be an adventure of a lifetime i will post a video capturing some aspects of that adventure in a week or so it included everything from getting lost in dense unexplored wilderness with no contact to the outside world to taking very high doses of ayahuasca and much more paul by the way aside from being my good friend is a naturalist explorer author and is someone who has dedicated his life to protecting the rainforest for this mission he founded jungle keepers you can help him if you go to jungle keepers dot org this trip for me was life changing it expanded my understanding of myself and of the beautiful world i'm fortunate to exist in with all of you so i'm glad i went and i'm glad i made it out alive and now a quick few second mention of a sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this podcast we got shipstation for fulfillment yahoo finance for investors betterhelp for mental health netsuite for business management software eight sleep for naps and shopify for selling stuff on the internet choose wisely my friends also if you want to work with our amazing team or just wanna get in touch with me go to lex freeman dot com slash contact and now onto the full ad reads as always no ads in the middle i try to make these interesting but if you must skip them friends please do check out the sponsors i enjoy their stuff maybe you will too this episode is brought to you by shipstation it's a software designed to save you time and money on fulfillment shipping stuff that you sell on the internet it integrates with shopify and wherever else you sell stuff and allows businesses medium large to just ship stuff i'm a huge fan of logistics and supply chains and looking at that incredibly complicated network of how one package gets from point a to point b part of that is the theoretical computer scientist in me because when you simplify that problem and formulate it as a graph theory problem then you can perform all kinds of optimizations on it which takes me back to some of my favorite courses on the theory and the practice so numerical optimization we're talking about nonlinear programming and then the more theoretical stuff with convex programming a particular kind of formulation of an optimization problem could be easy to solve or hard to solve so when i look at this world of logistics and shipping stuff from point a to point b where there's like a million point a's and a million point b's and combinatorial madness of that it's really exciting that there is systems that enable that all to work anyway i'm glad shipstation exists and i'm glad they're solving this tricky but extremely important problem go to ship station dot com slash lex and use code lex to sign up for your free sixty day trial that's ship station dot com slash lex this episode is also brought to you by yahoo finance a site that provides financial management reports information and use for investors i use it for the cool little feature of it letting you add your portfolio and thereby letting you monitor it and get news about related things so i have a td ameritrade account and mutual fund there which i guess got switched over to charles schwab and so there's a really nice interface that lets you monitor that but of course as part of that interface you can also see news of the crazy stuff that's going on in the markets it gives you an insight in what the people who really have money invested in the success of companies are thinking about where they're excited about where they're cynical about all that kind of stuff so it's a nice lens that we should see the world one that contrasts with a more kinda political and geopolitical lens which i often look at and also contrast with the historical lens you know i read a lot of history books and there times slow down the ephemeral ups and downs of every day are not as important but of course when you're living in the moment in the day this week the ups and downs of the world are extremely important and especially if you have money invested in certain small slices of that world so i use yahoo finance for monitoring that perspective on the world for comprehensive financial news and analysis go to yahoo finance dot com that's yahoo finance dot com this episode is also brought to you by betterhelp spelled h e l p help they figure out what you need to match you with a licensed therapist in in under forty eight hours it works for individuals it works for couples i remember seeing numbers like crazy numbers i got three hundred and fifty million messages chat phone video sessions over thirty five thousand licensed therapists over four point four million people that got help talking about a network so i was just talking about the logistics of shipping stuff from a to b here's the logistics of the human psyche the collective intelligence and the collective psyche of the human species seeking to explore the shadow of the individual minds but in so doing exploring the collective shadow of our species it'd be cool to visualize all that anyway we're just individuals we don't have a way to take the perspective of the species we only have our own mind our own conscious mind and the subjective view that it provides to the world so for that subjective view it's good to clean the lens so to speak every once in a while and that's what i think talk therapy does and betterhelp is super easy discreet affordable available everywhere so you should definitely try it at better help dot com slash lex and if you go there you'll save in your first

and the sounds of the urban world no machinery no people nothing just nature you can hear water you can hear the wind you can hear the animals the insects the little and the big and just that no people so as i was in that i got a chance to really think about the productive world let's say the world of companies and it is indeed out of the many things that make me happy it is one of the things that makes me really happy and that is to build to create stuff in this world that helps people whether that is as an individual programmer or on a larger scale by starting a company all of that makes me truly happy and somehow in the jungle full of gratitude to be able to exist on this beautiful earth i also was full of gratitude for all the cool things that humans have built but running a company is tricky and that's what netsuite helps with in fact over thirty seven thousand companies have upgraded to netsuite by oracle you can take advantage of netsuite's flexible financing plan at net suite dot com slash lex that's net suite dot com slash lex this episode is also brought to you by eight sleep and it's new and amazing pod four ultra one of the things when i was in the jungle i mean there's a few creature comforts that are taken away when you're out in nature especially when you're deep out in nature and of course one of the things you remember is the ability to have a bed to go to that's not full of insects and all that kind of stuff but a bed that can be cool man it would be amazing to get the a sleep bed off into the middle of the jungle because it's it's hot out there and to be able to cool down which i do with eight sleep would be a really cool experience anyway they've upgraded from pod three to pod four so pod four does two x the cooling power and they also added a super cool thing called pod four ultra which has a extra base that goes between the mattress and the bed frame that can control the positioning of the bed so it can elevate you say to like a reading position as a really really cool idea on many fronts including like you have this integrated system that does the sensing of the sleep time and the sleep phase and the hiv and heart rate and all that kind of stuff it does the cooling of both sides of the bed separately and now we can control the positioning of the bed it's crazy i really love it when products keep rapidly evolving improving that's really exciting to me go to ace sleep dot com slash leks and use code leks to get three hundred and fifty dollars off the pod four ultra this episode is also brought to you by shopify a platform designed for anyone to sell anywhere with a great looking online store i used it in just a few minutes to create an online store luxe freeman dot com slash store to sell a few shirts it can be a small

there and then you have a bunch of companies that do on demand printing that print the shirt and then ship the shirt and take care of the fulfillment all that kind of stuff and all of it is seamlessly integrated super easy to monitor once again there's a kind of theme in this discussion of networks of networks of human buying and selling shipping communicating all of that and i'm just so glad that people have created systems products services many of which are available online to connect humans together and let humans do their human things and help them flourish and enjoy life in all the ways

please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's paul rosley where are we right now paul lex we are in the middle of nowhere it's the amazon jungle there's vegetation there's insects there's all kinds of creatures a million heartbeats a million eyes so really where are we right now we are in peru in a very remote part of the western amazon basin and because of the proximity of the andean cloud forest to the lowland tropical rain forest we are in the most biodiverse part of planet earth there's more life per square acre per square mile out here than there is anywhere else on earth not just now but in the entire fossil record i can't believe we're actually here i can't believe you actually came and i can't believe you forced me to wear a suit that was the people's choice trust me alright we've been through quite a lot over the last few days we've been through a bit let me ask you a ridiculous question what are all the creatures right now if they wanted to could cause us harm the thing is the amazon rainforest has been described as the greatest natural battlefield on earth because there's more life here than anywhere else which means that everything here is fighting for survival the trees are fighting for sunlight the animals are fighting for prey everybody's fighting for survival and so everything that you see here everything around us will be killed eaten digested recycled at some point the jungle is really just a giant churning machine of death and life is kind of this moment of stasis where you you maintain this collection of cells in a particular dna sequence and then and then it gets digested again and recycled back and renamed into everything and so so the things the things in this forest while they don't want to hurt us there are things that are heavily defended because for instance a giant anteater needs claws to fight off a jaguar a stingray needs a stinger on its tail which is basically a serrated knife with venom on it to deter anything that would hunt that stingray even the catfish have pectoral fins that have razor long steak knife sized defense systems then you of course the jaguars the harpy eagles the piranha the candiru fish that can swim up a penis lodge themselves inside it's the amazon rainforest the thing is as you've learned this week nothing here wants to get us with the exception of exception of maybe mosquitoes every other animal just just wants to eat and exist in peace that's it but there is each of those animals like you described have a kinda radius of defense yeah so if you accidentally step into its home yeah into that radius it can cause harm or make them feel threatened make them feel threatened there is a defense mechanism that is activated some incredible defense mechanisms i mean you're talking about seventeen foot black caiman crocodiles that with significant size that could rip you in half anacondas the largest snake on earth bushmasters that can grow up to be nine to i think even eleven feet long and i've caught bushmasters that are thicker than my arms so for people who don't know bushmasters snakes what are these things these are vipers it's the i believe it's the largest viper on earth venomous extremely venomous with hinged teeth tissue destroying venom like if you get bitten by a bushmaster they say you don't you don't rush and and try and save your own life you try to savor what's around you look at look look around at the world smoke your last cigarette call your mom that's it so that moment of stasis that is life is going to end abruptly when you interact with one of those yeah i even have even this this seemingly can i just pause at how incredibly beautiful it is that you could just reach to your right and grab a piece of the charcoal it's like it's like even this seemingly beautiful little fern if you if you go this way on the fern you're fine as soon as out as soon as you go this way there's invisible little spikes on there if you wanna oh i see i feel that see that it's like everything is defended if you're driving on the road and you have your arm out the side or if you're on a motorcycle going through the jungle yeah and you get one of these it'll just tear all the skin right off your body it's kinda doing that to me now so what what would you do like we're going through the dense jungle yesterday and you slide down the hill your foot slips you slide him down and then you find yourself staring a couple feet away from a bushmaster snake what are you doing you're for people who somehow don't know somebody who loves admires snakes who has met thousands of snakes has worked with them respects them celebrates them what would you do with a bushmaster snake face to face face to face this has happened i've been there it's nice i've come face to face with a bushmaster and there's two things there's two reactions that you might get one is if the bushmaster decides that it's vacation time if it's sleeping if you just had a meal they'll come to the edges of trails or beneath the tree and they'll just circle up little spiral big spiral big pile of snake on the trail and they'll just sit there and one time there was a snake sitting on the side of a trail beneath the tree for two weeks this snake was just sitting there resting digesting his food out in the open in the rain in the sun in the night didn't matter you go near it barely even crack a tongue now the other option is that you get a bushmaster that's alert and hunting and out looking for something to eat and they're ready to defend themselves and so i once came across a bushmaster in the jungle at night and this bushmaster turned its head towards me looked at me and made it very clear i'm gonna go this way and so i did the natural thing that any snake enthusiast would do and i grabbed its tail now eleven feet later by the head the snake turned around and just said if you wanna meet god i can arrange the meeting i will oblige and i decided to let the bushmaster go mhmm and so it's it's like that with most animals you know a jaguar will turn and look at you and just remind you of how small you are like what did you see in the snake's eyes what how did you sense that this is not the right this is not this is gonna be your end if you proceed his readiness i i i wanted to get him by the tail and show him to the people that were there and maybe work with the snake a little bit as an eleven foot snake he the snake turned around and made it very clear like not today pal it's not gonna happen it's in the eyes and the movement and the tension of the body it was the movement and the s of the neck it was it was it was as if you pushed me and i went let's go make my day yeah like he just looked a little bit too yeah too ready he was like i love this okay alright so you know you just know you just know whereas like the snake you met last night yeah beautiful snake such a calm little thing he just focuses on eating baby lizards and little snails and things and that snake has no concept of defending itself it has no way to defend itself so even even something the size of a blue jay could just come and just peck that thing in the head and swallow it and it's a helpless little snake so it's it's really it kinda depends on the animal it depends on the mood you catch them in each one has a different temperament the grace of its movement was mesmerizing curious almost maybe i'm anthropomorphizing projecting onto it but it was the tongue flicking was a sign of curiosity i was trying to figure out what was going on i was like why am i on this treadmill of human skin you know they're just trying to get to the next thing trying to get hidden trying to get away from the light also the texture of the scales is really fascinating i mean it's my first first thing i've ever touched it's so interesting it was just such a incredible system of muscles that are all interacting together to make that kind of movement work and all the texture of its skin of its scales what what do you love about snakes from my first experience with a snake to all the thousands of experiences you had with snakes what do you love about these creatures i think it's when you just spoke about it it was that's the first snake you've met and it was a tiny little snake in the jungle and you spoke about it with so much light in your eyes and i think that because we've been programmed to be scared of snakes there's something there's something wondrous that happens in our brain maybe maybe it's just this this this joy of discovery that there's nothing to be scared of and whether it's a rattlesnake that is dangerous and that you need to give distance to but you look at it from a distance and you go woah or it's a harmless little grass snake that you can pick up and enjoy and give to a child it's they're just these strange legless animals that just exist you know they don't even have eyelids they're so different than us they have a tongue that sense senses the air and they to me are so beautiful and i've i've my whole life been defending snakes from humans and it's it's they seem misunderstood i think they're incredibly beautiful there's every color and variety of snakes there's venomous snakes there's tree snakes there's huge crushing anacondas it's just of the two thousand six hundred species of snakes that exist on earth there's just such beauty such complexity and such simplicity they're just they're just to me to me i feel like i feel like i'm i am friend with snake and and they rely on me to protect them from my people friend was snake me friend snake me friend snake you said some of them are sometimes aggressive some of them are peaceful is this a mood thing a personality thing a species thing is it what is it so the as far as i know there's only really two snakes on earth that could be aggressive because aggression indicates offense mhmm and so a reticulated python has been documented as eating humans anacondas although while it hasn't been publicized they have eaten humans every single other snake from boa constrictor to bushmasters to spitting cobra to grass snake to garter snake to everything else every single other snake does not want to interact with you mhmm they have no interest so there's no such thing as an aggressive snake once you get outside of anaconda and reticulated python aggression could be trying to eat you that's predation but for every other snake a rattlesnake if it was there would either go escape and hide itself or it would rattle its tail and tell us don't come closer a cobra will hood up and begin to hiss and say don't approach me i'm asking you nicely mhmm not to mess with me and most other snakes are fast or they stay in the trees or they're extremely camouflaged but their whole mo is just don't bother me i don't wanna be seen i don't wanna be messed with in fact all i wanna be do is be left alone and once in a while i just wanna eat and by the way when you see a snake drink your heart will break it's like seeing it's the only thing that's cuter than a puppy like watching a snake touch its mouth to water and just you just see that that little mouth going as they suck water in and it's like it's just so adorable watching the scaled animal just be like i need water in a state of vulnerability yeah yeah there's nothing cuter than a little puppy with a tongue like a baby ball python alright baby king cobra a tiki word baby elephant so what are they they're like at a puddle and they just take it in they can be at a puddle and they just take it in or one time in india i was with a snake rescuer and we found this nine foot king cobra this this god of a snake their ophiophagus hana is their latin name and they're they're snake eaters they're the king of the snakes the largest venomous snake and the people that call called the snake rescuer because it's a profession in india you know had gotten into their kitchen or their backyard and so we showed up and we got the snake and the snake rescuer he knew he looked at the snake and he went to me he said you know why do you think the snake would go in a house and he was quizzing me and i actually went you know i don't know is it warm is it cold you know like sometimes cats like to go into into the warm warm cars in the winter and he was like he's thirsty he goes watch this he took a water bottle poured it over the now the snake is standing up snake stands up three feet tall this is a huge king cobra with a hood terrifying snake to be around he leans over to the snake and the snake is standing there trusting him and he takes a water bottle and pours it onto the snake's nose and the snake turns up its nose and just starts drinking from the water bottle human giving water to snake big scary snake but this human understood snake gets water snake gets released in jungle everybody's okay so sometimes the needs are simple they just don't have the words to communicate them to us humans yeah and is it disinterest or is it fear almost like they don't notice us or is it where source the unknown aspect of it the uncertainty is a is a source of danger well animals live in a constant state of danger like if you look at that deer that we saw last night it's yeah stalking through the jungle wondering what's gonna eat it wondering if this is the last moment it's gonna be alive it's like the animals are constantly terrified of that this is their last moment yeah just for the listener we'll walk into the jungle late at night so it's darkness except our headlamps on and then all of a sudden paul stops zich and he looks in the distance he sees two eyes he's i think you thought is that a jaguar or is that a deer and it was moving its head like this mhmm like scared or maybe trying to figure it trying to localize itself trying to figure trying to see around you doing the same to it yeah the the two of you like moving your head yeah and like deep into the jungle like i don't know it's pretty far away through the trees you could still see it thirty thirty feet or so yeah that's the thing to actually mention i mean the with the headlamp you see the reflection in their eyes it's kind of incredible just to see a creature to try to identify a creature by just the the reflection from its eyes yeah and so the cats sometimes you'll get like a greenish or a bluish glow from the cats the deer are usually white to orange cayman orange nightjars orange snakes can usually be like orange moths spiders sparkle and so you have all these different as you walk through the jungle you can see all these different eyes and when something large looks at you like that deer did mhmm your first thing is what animal is this that i am staring back at because through the light you kinda get you see the reflection off the the bright light off the leaves and i couldn't tell at first because i actually that those big bright bright eyes it could have been an ocelot it could have been a jaguar it could have been a deer and then when it did this movement that's what the cats do they try to see around your light i thought maybe lex fridman's here we're gonna get lucky it's gonna be a jag right off trail your definition of lucky is a complicated one yeah it's a fascinating process when you see those two eyes trying to figure out what it is and it is trying to figure out what you are in that process let's talk about caiman we've seen a lot of different kinds of sizes we've seen a baby one a bigger one tell me about these sixteen foot plus apex predators of the amazon rainforest the big bad black caiman which is the largest reptilian predator in the amazon except for the anaconda they kind of both share that that that notch of apex predator they were actually hunted to endangered species level in the seventies because they're they're leather black scale leather but they're coming back they're coming back and they're huge and they're beautiful and i was i was walking near a lake and i never understood how big they could get except for i was walking near a lake last year and i was following this stream you know what it's like when you're following a little stream and there's just a little trickle of water and all of a sudden this river otter had been running the other direction on the tree on the stream river otter comes up to me and i swear to god this animal looked at me and went hey and i went hey he was like didn't expect to see me there and he turned around he like did a little spin started running down the stream then he turned around and he you could tell he was like let's go and i you know i'm not anthropomorphizing here the animal was asking me to come with him so i followed the river otter down the stream we started running down the stream and the river otter looks at me one more time he's like yo jumps into the lake and i'm like what does he want me to see now in the lake this river otter is doing dives and freaking out and going up and down and up and down and and they're very excited they're screaming they're screeching all of a sudden and i've never seen anything like this except for like game of thrones this croc head comes flying out of the water all of the river otters were attacking this huge black caiman sixteen feet wow head half the size of this table and she was thrashing her tail around creating these huge waves in the water trying to catch an otter and they're so fast yeah that they were zipping around or biting her and then going around and this otter swear to god interspecies looked at me and went watch this we're we're fucking with this caiman it was amazing and i for the first time i got to stand there watching this incredible interspecies fight happening they weren't trying to kill the caiman they were just trying to mess with it mhmm and the caiman was doing his best to try and kill these otters and they were just having a good time in that sick sort of hyper intelligent animal like wolf sort of way where they were just going you can't catch us yeah like intelligence and agility versus like raw power uh-huh and dominance i mean i got to handle some smaller cayman and just the power they had you know you scale that up to imagine a little sixteen foot even a ten foot any any kind of black haemone the kind of power they deliver maybe can you talk to that like the power they can generate with their tail with their neck with their jaw alligators and caiman and crocodiles have some of the strongest bite forces on earth think a saltwater crocodile wins as the strongest bite force on earth and you got to hold about a what was it a four foot spectacle came in and you got to feel i mean you're a black belt in jujitsu how do you how do you compare the the explosive force you felt from that animal compared to what a human can generate it's it's difficult to describe in words there's a lot of power and we're talking about the power of the neck like the what is i mean there's a lot it could generate power all up and down the body so probably the tail is a monster mhmm but just just the neck and you know not not to mention the the power of the bite that and the speed too because the thing i saw and and got to experience is how still and calm at least from my amateur perspective it seems calm still and then from that sort of zero to sixty you could just just go wild just thrashing and then there's also a decision it makes in that split second whether as it thrashes is it going to kinda bite you on the way or not and that's where that's where of the four species of caiman that we have here you see differences in their personalities as a species yeah and so you can like just like you know like generally golden retrievers are viewed as a as a friendly dog generally not every single one of them but as a rule spectacle came in puppies you released one in the river and it did nothing didn't bite one of your fingers it just swam away we dropped one in the river and what did it do it chose peace now i had a smooth fronted came in a few weeks ago and this is probably about a three and a half footer not big enough to kill you but very much big enough to grab one of your fingers and just shake it off your body just death roll it right off and as i was being careful totally different caiman than the one that you got to see this one has spikes coming off it they're like like like leftover dinosaurs it's like they evolved during the dinosaur times and never change they have spikes and bony plates and all kinds of strange growths that you don't see on the other smoother caiman and i tried to release this one without getting bitten and i threw it into the stream gently into the water just went and tried to pull my hands back and as i pulled my hand back this came in in the air turned around and just tried to give me one parting blow and just got one tooth whack right to the bone of my finger and bone injury feels different than a skin injury so you inch instantly and it just reminds you of that's a cayman with a head this big mhmm and it hurt and i know that it could've taken off my finger now if you scale that up to a black cayman it's it's rib crushing it's it's zebra head removing size you know just just meat destroying it's it's incredible it's nature's nature's metal sort of you know just raw power so what's the the the biggest crock you've been able to handle we were doing cayman surveys for years and we would go out at night and you wanna figure out what are the populations of black cayman spectacled caiman smooth fronted caiman dwarf caiman and the only way to see which caiman you're dealing with is to catch it because a lot of times you get up close with the light and you can see the eyes at night but you can't quite see what species it is for instance this past few months we found two baby black caiman on the river which is unprecedented here we haven't seen that in decades decades so it's important that we monitor our croc population so i started catching small ones in mother of god i write about the first one that me and jj caught together which was probably a little bigger than this table and probably mid twenties bravado and competition with other young males of my species led to me trying to go as big as i could mhmm and i jumped on a spectacle came in that was slightly longer than i am and i'm five nine so i i jumped on this probably six foot croc and quickly realized that my hands couldn't get around its neck and my legs were wrapped around the base of its tail and the thrash was so intense that as it took me one side i barely had enough time to realize what was happening before it beat me against the ground my headlamp came off so now i'm blind in the dark laying in a river in the amazon rainforest hugging a six foot crocodile and i went jj as i always do but i in that moment before i even let go i knew i couldn't let go of the croc because if i let go of the croc i thought she was gonna destroy my face so i said okay now i'm stuck here if i just stay here i can't release her i need help but i was like i'm never ever ever ever gonna try and solo catch a croc this big again i was like this is this is i knew in that moment i was like this is good enough so anything longer than you you don't control the tail you don't have you have barely control of anything really yeah and that's a spectacle came in a black came in is a is a whole other order of magnitude there it's like saying like oh you know i i was play fighting with my golden retriever versus i was play fighting with like you know what what's the biggest scariest dog you could think of this is the the dog from sandlot a giant gorilla dog thing like a like a malamute something something huge what do they call it mastiffs yeah mastiffs i mean you mentioned dinosaurs what what do you admire about black caiman what they've been here for a very very long time there's something prehistoric about their appearance about their way of being about their presence in this jungle with crocodiles you're looking at this this mega survivor they're in a class with sharks where it's like they've been here so long when you talk about multiple extinctions you talk about the sixth extinction earth's going through all this stuff the crocodiles and the cockroaches have seen it all before they're like man we remember what that comet looked like and they're not impressed yeah they have this they carry this wisdom yeah in their power yeah in the simplicity of their power they carry the wisdom yeah and they're just sitting there in the streams and they don't care and even if there's a nuclear holocaust you know that there would just be some crocs sitting there dead eyed in that stagnant water waiting for the life to regenerate so they could eat again it's gonna be the remaining humans versus the crocs and the cockroaches and the cockroaches are just background noise yeah they'll always be there sons of bitches you know we're talking about individual black caiman and caiman and different species of caiman but the when whenever they're together and you see multiple eyes which i've gotten to experience it's quite a feeling there's just multiple eyes looking back at you mhmm of course for you that's immediate excitement you immediately go towards that you wanna see it you want to explore it maybe catch them analyze what the species is all that kind of stuff yeah what what's can can you just describe that feeling with the when they're together and they're looking at you so head above water eyes reflecting the light yeah so the other night lex and i were in the river with jj surviving a thunderstorm we're in the rain and we had covered our covered our equipment with our boats and the only thing that we could do was get in the in the river to keep ourselves dry and so we were in the river at night in the dark no stars just a little bit of canopy silhouetted with all this rain coming down it was such a dim you could hardly hear anything and all the way downriver i just see this caiman eye in my headlamp light mhmm and i started walking towards it because i was like this is even better we can catch a caiman while we're in this thunderstorm in the amazon river and when jj went paul it's too far jj very rarely very rarely like he'll he'll make a suggestion like he'll usually go like maybe it's far but in that situation deep in the wilderness unknown came in size he went paul it's too far don't leave the three of us right now yeah we're too far out to take risks we're too far out to be walking along the riverbed at night because then you know right here at the research station if you step on a stingray you get evaced out where we went nothing so so for me seeing those eyes i think i've become so comfortable with so many of these animals that i i may have crossed into the territory where i feel i feel so comfortable with with many of these animals that they just don't worry me anymore mhmm i mean you were i i i looked at you in a raft while you had a sizable probably about twelve foot black came in right next to your raft i watched its head go on bubbles the bubbles it was all coming up right next to your raft as he he was just moving along the bottom of the river because he looked at me went under and then my raft passed and yours came over him so now i'm looking back and your raft is going over this black caiman and i'm going i'm not worried at all mhmm i was not worried i was not worried that the caiman would freak out i was not worried that he would try to attack you i knew a hundred percent that caiman just wanted us to go so you could go back to eating fish yeah that's it man it's humbling it's humbling these giant creatures and especially at night like you were talking about and for me it's both scary and just beautiful when the head goes under because like underwater it's their domain so anything can happen so what is it doing that its its head has gone under it could be bored it could be hungry looking for some fish it could be maybe wanting to come closer to you to investigate maybe you have some food around you maybe it's an old friend of yours and just wanna say hi i don't know i have a few on the river old friends no when we see their heads go under it's just they're just getting out of the way we're we're shining a light at them and they're going why is there a light at night i'm uncomfortable head under so these came in again you think of it as this big aggressive animal but i don't know anybody that's been eaten by a black caiman and the the smaller species smooth fronted caiman dwarf caiman spectacal caiman they're not gonna eat any but again at the worst if you were doing something inappropriate with a caiman like you jumped on it and were trying to to do research and and it bit your hand it could take your hand off but that's the only time i've been walking down the river and stepped on a caiman and the caiman just swims away and so in my mind caiman are just these they're peaceful dragons that sit on the side of the river and so to me they are my friends and i worry about them because two months ago we were coming upriver and on one of the beaches was a beautiful about five foot black caiman with a big machete cut right through the head the whole cayman was wasted nothing was eaten but the cayman was dead what do you think that was curious humans just committing violence yeah just loggers people who aren't from this part of the amazon because a local person would either eat the animal or not mess with it like piko would never kill a caiman for no reason because it doesn't make any sense so these are clearly people who aren't from the region which usually means loggers because they've come from somewhere else they're doing a job here and they they're just cleaning their pots in the river at night and they see eyes come near them because the caiman probably smells fish and then they just whack because they wanna see it and they're just curious monkeys on a beach and again me friend of caiman i protect from my type that said you know you protect your friends and you analyze and study your friends but sometimes friends can have a bit of a misunderstanding and if you have a bit of a misunderstanding with a black cayman i feel like just a bit of a misunderstanding could lead to a bone crushing situation but not for a little five foot caiman and i think that's incredibly speciesist of you about humans or about caiman no i'm saying like all my friends do the same thing they go you swim in the amazon rainforest you know you swim in that river and i go yes every day we you know backflips into the river we've been swimming in the river how many times with the piranha and the stingray and the candiru and the caiman and the anacondas all of it in the river with us mhmm and we just do it and what's that for you so what what allows you to doing that to do that knowing and having researched all the different things that can kill you which i feel like most of them are in the river mhmm what allows you to just get in there with us well i i think it's something about you where you become like this portal through which it's possible to see nature as not threatening but beautiful and so in that you kinda naturally by hanging out with you i get to see the beauty of it there is danger out there but the danger is part of it it just like the there's a lot of danger in the city there's danger in life there's a lot of ways to get hurt emotionally physically there's a lot of ways to die in the stupidest of ways we went on a expedition to the forest just twisting your ankle breaking your foot getting a bite from a thing that gets infected it's there's a lot of ways to die and get hurt in the stupidest of ways in a nondramatic cayman eating you alive kinda way yeah it it it strikes me as unfair because humans are we're still in our minds so so programmed to worry about that predator that predator that predator what predator we've killed everything black caimans are coming off the endangered species list we exterminated wolves from north america i actually heard a suburban lady one time tell her son watch out foxes will get you mhmm foxes yeah they eat baby rabbits and mice well in the case of apex predators i think when people say dangerous animals they really are talking about just the power of the animal and the black came in have a lot of power lot of power and so it's almost just a way to celebrate the power of the animal sure and if it's in celebration then i'm all for it because my god is that power like the waves of of of fury that you saw like when that tail i mean you saw you saw the tail with that perfect amazing thing with all those interlocking scales that works so it's like a perfect creation of engineering and then and then when you have one that's this thick and all of a sudden that thing is moving with all the acceleration of that power wow the volume of water the sound that comes out of their throat they're such they're dragons mhmm we talked about the scales of the snake with like the came in just the way it felt yeah was incredible just the armor the texture of it was so cool yeah i don't know like the the the bottom it came in have a certain kind of texture and it just all feels like power but also all feels like designed really well it's like it's like exploring through touch like a world war two tank or something like that it's just yeah it's the engineering that went into this thing yeah that like the mechanism of evolution that created a thing that could survive for such a long time is just like incredible this is a work of art the pot you know the defense mechanisms the power of it the damage it can do how effective it is as a hunter all of that all you could feel that in just by touching it do you ever see the the mashup where they put side by side the image of i think it's a falcon in flight next to a stealth bomber and they're almost the exact same design it's incredible like that what's the equivalent for for a croc like i said maybe a tank like a ton more like an armadillo turtle yeah like hippos and yeah there may not be a a machine a a war machine equivalent of a crocodile it would have to have like a big jaw element to it yeah and the water i mean we we talked also about hippos those are interesting creatures from all the way across the world just monsters yeah hippos and rhinos hippos are bigger usually or rhinos are bigger rhinos rhinos is after elephants it's the largest white rhinos they can be terrifying too again when you step into the defense absolutely but i have to tell you after being around so many rhinos your friends your friend brother have rhino friends yeah black and white rhinos yep and they're all sweethearts and i mean i mean sweethearts and i mean when you look at a rhino it's like a living dinosaur i know it's a mammal but somehow it screams dinosaur because it seems like pleistocene pleistocenic and and and from another age with the giant horn and they're so much bigger than you think like they're minivan sized animals like you're you're we're not taller than they are at the shoulder and they have the strange shaped head and the huge horn and they sit there eating grass all day so if a rhino is dangerous to a human it's because the rhino is going don't hurt me yeah don't hurt me don't don't hurt my baby and then they're like you know what i'll just kill you it'd be easier because you're scaring me right now you're too close to that rhino yeah and so like there again i just think it's funny because humans were so quickly to go which snakes are aggressive there are no aggressive snakes you know rhinos can be dangerous if provoked otherwise they're peaceful fat grass unicorns you know like they're they're really pretty calm they're way of these incredible giant animals and the largest animals on our planet the black caiman the rhinos the elephants all the big beautiful stuff is becoming less and less yeah and it almost reminds me like in game of thrones they're like yeah yeah they're in the beginning they're like yeah there used to be dragons and it was like this memory and it's like yeah we used to have mammoths and we we used to have stellar sea cows that were sixteen feet long manatees and it's there were things we used to have the caspian tiger that only went extinct in the nineties our lifetimes and it's that that's mind blowing to me that's that that has haunted me since i'm a child i remember learning about extinction and i went wait you're telling me that i remember being a kid and going by the time i grow up you're saying that i gorillas could be gone elephants could be gone and because we're doing it and then i i just that i i remember i remember looking at the the nightlight being blurry because i was crying i was so upset and oh and it was lonesome george that turtle the galapagos tortoise where there was one left and they said if we just if we just had a female he could live and i as a six seven eight year old that destroyed me we're all just trying to get laid including that turtle including that turtle for a few hundred years dude so for young people out there you think you're having trouble think about that turtle think about that turtle yeah you know there's a turtle that darwin and steve irwin both owned yeah yeah i heard about that turtle man they live a long time yeah they've seen things they've seen things that there's a there's a great like internet joke where they're like they're like accusing him of like being incongruous with modern times they're like he did nothing to stop slavery he didn't fight in world war two cancel the turtle yeah cancel the turtle oh shit what a world we live in so it's interesting you mentioned black caiman and and anacondas are both apex predators so it seems like the reason they can exist in similar environments is because they feed on slightly different things how is it possible for them to coexist i read that anacondas can eat cayenne but not black cayenne how often do they come in conflict so anacondas and caiman occupy the exact same niche mhmm and they're born at almost the exact same size and unlike most species they don't have sort of a size range that they're confined to they start at this big baby caiman are this big baby anacondas are a little longer but there's they're thinner and they don't have legs so it's the same thing in in terms of mass and they're all in the streams or at the edges of lakes or swamps and so the baby anacondas eat the baby caiman baby caiman can't really take down an anaconda they're they're going for little insects and fish they they have a quite a small mouth so they again it's in their interest to hide from everything a bird a heron can eat a baby came and pop it back and so they have to survive but the anaconda and the caiman kinda kinda joust as they grow can you actually explain how the anaconda would take down a a caiman like would it first use constriction then eat it or what what's the meth methodology yeah so anacondas have a kind of a i don't know like a three point constriction system where their first thing is anchor mhmm something like jiu jitsu so the first thing is latch on to you i like how i'm writing this down like alright this is jiu jitsu like master class here this is for when you're wrestling an anaconda just in case and you'll be like the coach in the sideline scooper you got alex yeah don't let him take the back yeah alright so so one time me and jj were following a herd of collared peccary and jj's teaching me tracking so we're following you know the the hoof prints through the mud and we're doing this and i'm talking about no backpacks just machetes bare feet running through the jungle and we come to this stream and jj's like i think we missed them you know i think they went and i'm like no no no they went here look and not because i'm a great tracker because i can see hun you know a few dozen footprints hundreds of individual footprints right there and i'm going no no they just crossed here and jj was like you know what we're not gonna get eyes on them today he was like it's okay he's like we did good we followed them for a long time and i was like cool and then i was trying to gauge like can i drink this stream and i see a colpa and a colpa is a salt deposit where animals come to to feed because sodium is a is a is a deficiency that most herbivores have here and all of a sudden i just hear like the sound of a wet stick snapping just that bone crunch and i looked down and there's about a sixteen foot anaconda wrapped around a freshly killed peccary wild boar and what this anaconda had done was as the all the pigs were going across the stream the anaconda had grabbed it by the jaw swiped the legs wrapped around it bent it in half and then crushed its ribs and that's what the anaconda do whether it's to mammals to caiman it's all the same thing it's grab on they have six rows of backwards facing teeth so once they hit you they're never gonna come off you actually have to go deeper in and then open before you can come out all those backward facing teeth so they have an incredible anchor system and then they use their weight to pull you down to hell to pull you down into that water wrap around you and then start breaking you and every breath you take you go and you you you're up against a barrier mhmm and then when you when you exhale they go a little tighter and you're never gonna get that space back your lungs are never going to expand again and i know this because i've been in that crush mhmm before jj pulled me out of it and so this pig the anaconda had gotten it and as the pig was thrashing and the anaconda was wrapping around i had bent it in half mhmm and i just heard those vertebrae going yeah and so for a caiman it's the same thing they just grab and they wrap around it and then they have to crush it until there's no response they'll wait an hour they'll wait a long time until there's no response from the animal they'll overpower it then they'll then they'll reposition probably yawn a little bit open their jaw and then start forcing that entire now here's the crazy thing is that an anaconda has stomach acid capable of digesting an entire crocodile where nothing comes out the other side mhmm and when you see how thick the bony plate of a crocodile skull is that that can go in the mouth and nothing comes out the other side that's insane and so it always made me wonder on a chemistry level how you can have such incredible acid in the stomach that doesn't harm the anaconda itself and someone said that you could digest oh it's some kind of mucus oh oh the mucus there's lot oh interesting there's levels of protection from the anaconda itself but it seems like the anaconda is such a simple system as an organism i know like but like that simplicity taken a scale could just do the can swallow a came and digest it slowly i know but my question was how how on earth is it physically possible to have this hellish bile that can digest anything even something as as as horrendous as a as a a caiman scales and bones and all the hardest shit in nature and then not hurt the snake itself and i had a chemist explain to me that it's probably some sort of mucus system that that lines the stomach and and neutralizes the acid and keeps it floating in there but my god that must be powerful stuff so what does it feel like being crushed choked by an anaconda you when an anaconda is wrapped around you and you you find yourself in in the in the shocking realization that these could be your last moments breathing you are confronted with the vast disparity in power that there is so much power in these animals so much crushing deliberate reptilian ancient power that doesn't care they're just trying to get you to stop they just want you to stop ticking and there's nothing you can do and there's i find it very awe inspiring when i encounter that kind of power when you even if it's that you see you know you see a dog run you know you you ever try to outrun a dog and they just zip by you and you go wow you know or you see a horse kick and you go oh my god if that if that hoof hit anyone's head it'd knock them three states over and it's like it's like there there is muscular power that is so far that like you said that explosive mhmm that we we dream of doing it like imagine if like a a muay thai kickboxer could could harness that sort of cayman power that smash and so it's it's just awe inspiring i think it's really really impressive what animals can do and we're we're all you know we're all the same sort of makeup for the most part all the mammals you know we all have our skeletons look so similar we all have like you know if you look at like a kangaroo's biceps and chest it looks so much like a like a like a a man's and if same thing goes for a bear or you ever see a naked chimp there's like chimps with alopecia oh shit and so if oh they're shredded yeah it looks like a bodybuilder like it's got cuts and huge huge everything like it's got pecs and they got that face that's just like yeah just let me in what now yeah where's your wallet do something but yeah but there's a the specialization of a lifetime of doing damage to the world and using those muscles it just makes you makes you just that much more powerful than most humans because humans i guess have more brain so they get lazy they start puzzle solving versus you know using the biceps directly well yes and no and i have this question okay so i you know that whole you are what you eat thing now we one time here had two chickens now one of them was a wild chicken like from the farm had walked around its whole life finding insects and the other chicken was like factory raised mhmm and so we cut the heads off of both of them mhmm started getting ready to cook them now the factory raised chicken was like a much higher percentage of fat mhmm had less muscle on its body was softer tissue a a lighter color the farm raised chicken had darker more sinewy muscles less fat was clearly a better made machine and so my question is is that what's happening with us you know like if you go see a sherpa who's been walking his whole life and pulling you know and walking behind musk oxes and lifting things up mountains and breathing clean air and not being in the city versus someone that's just been chowing down at ihop for forty years and never getting off the couch like i imagine it's the same thing that you you become what you eat yeah i mean like you and i were like half dead running up a mountain meanwhile there's a grandma just like walking and she's been walking that road and she's just built different with her alpaca on her shoulders with a baby and she just they're just built different when you when you apply your body in a physical way your whole life yeah like you can't replicate that like like just like that chimp has those from constantly moving through the canopy constantly using those arms just like if you ever you know if you see an olympic athlete or you hug rogan mhmm exactly the same go why is there so much muscle in there that's exactly what i what i feel like when you give him a hug this is this is definitely a chimp of some sort how how does that just just that the the constriction of the anaconda just the the the feeling of that are they doing that based on instinct or is there some brain stuff going on like is this just like a basic procedure that they're doing and they just really don't give a damn they're not like thinking oh paul this is this kind of species it would taste good or is it just a mechanism to just start activating and you can't stop it with an anaconda i really think it's the second one yeah i do think that they're impressive and beautiful and incredibly arcane i think they're a very simple system a very ancient system and i think that once you once you hit predation mode it's going down no matter what this stupid mosquito i'm going like this and every time he just flies around my hand like i'm a big slow giant and he just goes around my hand and then he goes back to the same spot like and i'm like no and then he comes right back to the same spot it's like it's like he's just going fuck you well here's the question if the mosquito is stupid and you can't catch it what does that make you fucking stupid dude i flicked a wasp off me the other day it flew back like twelve feet in in the air corrected and then flew back at my face it made so many correct like calculations and corrections and decided to come back and let me know about it and i was like shit that wasp probably went back to the nest said guess what happened today this bitch ass kid from brooklyn tried to flick me and i showed him what's up i had him running they had a good chuckle on that one yeah you actually mentioned to me just on the topic of anacondas that you've been participating in a lot of scientific work on on the topic so like really in everything you've been doing here you are celebrating the animals you're respecting the animals you're protecting the animals but you're also excited about studying the animals and their environment so you've you're actually a coauthor on a on a paper on a couple of papers but one of them is on anacondas and studying green anaconda hunting patterns what's that about so the lead authors of that paper pat champagne and carter paine friends of mine and what we started noticing for me began at that story i told you where we were coming across the stream and we saw the anaconda had had had been positioned just below a colpa and then other people began noticing that anaconda seemed to always be beneath these colpas where mammals were gonna be coming and that that contrasted with what we knew about anacondas because what we understood about anacondas is that they're purely ambush predators and they don't pursue their prey but what we began finding out here and pat led the process of amazing scientists he worked with acadia university for a long time worked with us for a long time and and he he was one of the first to put a transmitter in an anaconda right around here and we were able to see their movements mhmm and that's what these papers are showing is that they actually do pursue their prey they do move up and down using the streams as corridors through the forest they actually do pursue their prey they actually do seek out food so i mean think about it it's a it's a giant anaconda obviously it's not it can't just sit in one spot it has to put some work into it and so they're using scent and they're using communication to use the streams so you could be walking in the forest in a very shallow stream mhmm and see a sizable anaconda looking for a meal so in the shallow stream it moves not just in the water but in the sand yeah so it's it it also likes so is it to burrow a little bit they burrow quite a bit and so these large snakes operate subterranean more than we think interesting like there's times that you'll go with a tracker you go with the telemetry set and it'll say like it will be over the snake snake's underground snake has found either a recess under the sides of the stream you saw it last night where all the fish have have their holes under the side of the stream there was a there was a six foot dwarf came in right in the stream right where we were standing mhmm he had his cave he goes under there they know they have their system yeah we walked by it we walked by it and he stuck his head out because he thought we'd gone and then we turned around and i just got a glimpse of him because i was in the front of the line and he just went right back into his cave you you guys are not gonna touch me and so yeah with the anacondas it's been really exciting and in twenty fourteen jj and me and mohsen and pat and lee we all we ended up catching what at the time was the record for eunectes marinas scientifically measured it was eighteen feet six inches two hundred twenty twenty pounds one of the largest female anacondas on record and since that time these guys have been continuing to study the species continuing to just again just add a little bit by little bit to the knowledge we have of the species and studying green anacondas in lowland tropical rainforest you've seen how hard it is to to move to operate to navigate in this environment and so when you think of the fact that in order to learn anything about this species you have to spend vast amounts of time first locating them and then finding out a way to keep tabs on them because even if you get lucky enough to see an anaconda by the edge of a a stream to to be able to observe it over time to learn its habits or to put a radio transmitter on it or to take any sort of valuable information from the experience is almost impossible and so a lot of the stuff that i wrote about mother of god us jumping on anacondas and trying to catch them and at first it just seemed like something we were doing to learn to to just try and see them but it ended up being that we were wildly trying to figure out methodology that would have scientific implications later on because now it's allowing us to try and find the largest anacondas and people used to say there's no way this twenty five foot twenty seven foot well there's just that video of the guy swimming with the twenty foot anaconda and so now as we keep going well i'm going well maybe through drone identification we could find where the largest anacondas are sitting on top of floating vegetation and even then how do we restrain them so that we could measure them and prove this to the world it's sort of a side quest but so by doing these kinds of studies you figure out how they move about the world what motivates them in terms of when they hunt where they hide in the world as the size of the anaconda change so all of that that's that's those are scientific studies yeah i mean look there's so much that we don't know about this forest we don't know what medicines are in this forest we don't know with a lot of the fifteen hundred there's something like four thousand species of butterflies in the amazon rainforest and of the fifteen hundred species that are here in this region all of them have a larval stage caterpillars right and each of the caterpillars has a specific host plant that they need to need to eat in order to become a successful butterfly to enter the next life cycle and for most of the species that fill the butterfly book we don't know what those interactions are i recently got to see the white witch which is a huge moth it's it's one of the it's it's one of the two largest moths in the world it's the largest moth by wingspan wow huge it looks like a bird mhmm big white moth we still i believe i believe that we still don't know what the caterpillar looks like it's twenty twenty four we have iphones and penis shaped rocket ships like yeah we don't know where that moth starts its life yeah we still haven't figured that out by the way the rocket ships are shaped that way for efficiency purposes not because they wanted to look make it look like a penis speaking of which i have ran across a lot of penis trees while exploring have you and make me this i know it's not just a figment of my imagination i'm pretty sure they're real in fact you explained it to me and they they make me very uncomfortable because there's just a lot of penises hanging off of a tree yes i don't know what the purpose is who they're supposed to attract but it certainly makes but certainly paul like really enjoys them yeah yeah well clearly you've you've done some some research and you've noticed a lot of them i haven't even seen them there was there was there was a time when i almost fell and to catch my balance i had to grab one of the penises of the penis tree and yep unforgettable anaconda the biggest baddest anaconda in the amazon versus the biggest baddest black caiman because you mentioned they're like there's a race if there's a fight there's ufc in cage who wins this is the biggest and the baddest the biggest and the baddest that you have can imagine given all the studies you've done of the two animals species the baddest you're talking about an eighteen foot several hundred pound black caiman versus a twenty six foot three hundred fifty pound anaconda yeah i think it's a it's a it's a death stalemate i think the cayman slams the anaconda bites onto it the anaconda wraps the cayman and then they both thrash around until they both kill each other because i think the the cayman will tear them up so bad and and the caiman's not gonna let go he's just gonna the caiman's never gonna let go but then he's gonna he's gonna realize that he's he's also being constricted so then he's gonna stop and he's gonna he's gonna keep slamming down on that anaconda mhmm and the anaconda's just gonna keep constricting but if the cayman can do enough damage before the end it's again it's almost like a striker versus a jiu jitsu yeah you know if you can get enough elbows in before they lock you how fast is the construction so it's pretty slow it's it's no it's it's incredibly it's it's incredibly quick so it's it's it's you to you see you take the back and get me in choke hold right it's that it's i have maybe thirty seconds maybe on the upward side if you haven't cinched it under my under my throat but if you've gotten good position it's over is there any way to unwrap the choke undo the choke defending skin not unless you have outside help unless you have you know another human or another ten humans coming to unwrap the tail or help you but for an animal like if a deer gets hit by an antichrist no way they don't stand a chance so the the the the black camel would bite somewhere somewhere close to the head and then and just try to hold on and thrash yeah i don't i don't think a large black caiman here's the thing every fisherman knows this they're like the biggest fish they're smart yeah and more importantly they're shrewd they're careful a huge black caiman that's sixteen feet long isn't gonna be messing with a big anaconda like they they they'll they won't they won't cross paths because while they technically occupy the same type of environment that black caiman's gonna have this deep spot in a lake and that anaconda's gonna have found this floating forest like sort of black stream backwater where it's gonna be and they'll have made that their home for decades and they'll already have cleaned out the competition so maybe if there was a flood and they got pushed together they they they could have some sort of a showdown but almost more certainly is that when they get to that size that came in at any sign of danger bloop right under the water just yeah it's almost like it's like even if you what do you learn when you're a black belt you know what what do you what do you do with a street fight you still run away mhmm there's no reason for a street fight and i think the animals really understand that there's no there's no reason for this so like a giant anaconda and a giant black came in they they could probably even coexist in the same environment just knowing using the wisdom to avoid the fight like why or they would have a big big showdown and one of them would either die or have to leave they'd have a territorial dispute yeah yeah without killing either of them on it dude nature anything could happen one of the things that me and pat wrote up was that i saw a yellow tailed creepo which is like a six foot rat snake eating an oxyropus melanogenes which is the the the red snake that we found last night and just no one had ever in scientific literature we'd never seen a a cribo eating an oxyropus before and so i had the observation in the field i sent it to pat champagne pat writes it up paper and so it's like it's this really cool that's a really cool system because we're just out here all the time you end up seeing things jj's dad saw an anaconda eating a taper taper is the size of a cow damn and it's that guy didn't lie you know some people you trust your sources on that he he saw enough stuff he didn't need to make up stories and you know how you you know what i love now is when you go to so when you ask people when we were going up the mountain with jimmy yeah jj said to him he goes have you ever seen a puma up here in the mountains and jimmy goes they're up here and j j jj went no no have you seen it and jimmy went no never seen one and you know how most people will go yeah yeah yeah i've seen that makes me trust a person when they admit no i haven't seen it they're up here i haven't seen it and jamie's been living there his whole life his whole life there's pumas in the mountains you know mountain lions pumas whatever the hell you know there's all different names for them they're distributed from i think from alaska down through argentina it's they're everywhere it's an extremely successful species mhmm from deserts to high mountains everything i think you're saying pumas have a have a curiosity have a way about them where they like explore like follow people like just to kinda figure out like just that curiosity versus like as opposed to causing harm or hunting and that kind of stuff like what is this about i think it's based in predatory instincts but i also think there is a playfulness to higher intelligence animals that you don't see in lower intelligence animals and so something like a rabbit for instance you're never gonna see a rabbit come in to check you out yeah you just would you just you can't even think of it like that like a rabbit's just gonna either eat or run away there's really two settings when you think of something like a river giant river otter or a tyra which is they call it manco here it's a it's a huge arboreal weasel and they'll come check you out i woke up at my house the other day and there was a tyra climbing up the side of the house and he was looking down at me sleeping and it's like he came to check me out like it's like they're smart enough and they're brave enough here's the important thing they know that they can fend for themselves they can fight they can climb they can run and so they're like let me i'm curious mhmm i got time let me check this out yeah they're gathering information i wonder how complex and sophisticated their world model is like how they're integrating all the information about the environment like where all the different trees are where all the different nests of the different insects are what the different creatures are dip by size all that kind of stuff i'm i'm sure they don't have enough you know storage up there to like keep all that but they probably keep the important stuff base you know so sort of integrate the experiences they have into like what is dangerous what is mhmm tasty all that kind of stuff i think it's more complex than we realize you go back to that friends to wall book are we smart enough to know how smart animals are there's so many incredible examples of controlled studies where the researchers weren't understanding how to shed being so insurmountably human and understand that there are other types of intelligence and whether that's elephants or cats so big cats for instance we just saw a camera trap video from last night yeah where you see one of our workers walk down the trail and then five minutes later a cat behind him mhmm by the way we're walking just exactly the same area also exactly the same time yeah yeah so we're out there and there's deer and there's cats and there's a jaguar and there's a puma and there's all these animals out there and we're out in the night in the inky black night in this ocean of darkness beneath the trees and we're just exploring and getting to see everything and there's all these little eyes and heartbeats i love the jungle at night man it's the most exciting thing you know one of the things you do when you turn off the headlamp yeah complete darkness yeah all around you and just the sounds everything you hear the cicadas the birds they're all screaming about sex yeah all the time so they're just trying to get laid yeah so all of them are making mating calls now the trick is to make your mating call without attracting a predator yeah but at night what what what amazes me is that for us it's so from the from the caveman logic of it's hard to make fire here it's hard to even light a fire here to having this this this incredible beam of of of it you know all of a sudden we can look at the jungle and walk through that darkness then we're seeing the frogs on those leaves and the snakes moving through the undergrowth and the deer sneaking through the shadows it's like it's almost as supernatural as skydiving it's a strange thing to be able to do that technology allows us to do we're doing something really complex and we're walking on trails that have been cleared for us mhmm that we've planned out and so walking through the jungle at night you just get this freak show of of of biodiversity and i'm i'm addicted to it i truly love it except for the times over the last few days when we walked on through jungle without a trail and that's just a different experience well how would you categorize if somebody said lex i think i'm gonna go for a hike through the jungle not on the trail yeah what would you tell them every step is really hard work every step is a puzzle every step is full of possibility of hurting yourself in a multitude of ways you just a wasp nest under a leaf a hole under a leaf on the ground where if you step in and you're gonna break a knee ankle leg and going to not be able to move for a long time there's all kinds of ants that can hurt you a little or can hurt you a lot bullet ants there's snakes and spiders and oh my favorite that i've gotten to know intimately is different plants with different defensive mechanisms one of which is just spikes so sharp you have i don't know if you brought it but there's i didn't bring it i didn't bring it there's where's my club there's an epic club with the spikes but there's so many trees that have spikes on them sometimes they're obvious spikes sometimes less than obvious spikes and you know it could be just an innocent as you take a step through a dense jungle it could be an innocent placing of a hand on that tree that could just completely transform your experience your life by penetrating your hand with like twenty thirty forty fifty spikes yeah and just changing everything that's just a completely different experience than going on on a trail where you where you're observer of the jungle versus the participant of it and yeah and it truly is extreme hard work to take every single step now just think about this i think scientifically because people like to summarize people like to get really really sort of cavalier with our scientific progress and they go you know we've already explored the amazon it's like well have we because in between each tributary is you know let's say just between some of them let's just say a hundred miles of of unbroken forest who's explored that yeah maybe some of the tribes have been there maybe some areas they haven't been now when you're talking about scientists whether they're indigenous scientists western scientists whatever so many of the areas in this jungle that is the size of the continental us still have not been accessed and the places where people are doing research see i've been down here long enough i see all the phds come down here and they all go to the same few research stations mhmm they're safe they have a bed if you get hella dropped into the middle of the jungle in the deepest most remote parts you're gonna find micro ecosystems you're gonna see little species variations you're gonna see a a type of flower that jj's never seen before like what happened the other day as you start walking through new patches of forest you start finding new species and everything here changes you just go a little bit upriver and the animals you see differ you go on this side of the river versus on the north side of the river there's two other species of primates there that don't exist here and that's in the mammal paper that we did with the the emperor tamarins and the pygmy marmosets that the rangers found yeah the the mammal paper is looking at the diversity of life in this one region of the amazon what kinda can can you talk talk more about that paper mammal diversity along the les piedras river once again the mammal paper pat champagne the prodigy he was sort of leading on this with a bunch of other scientists who have worked in the region including holly o'donnell out of oxford myself i really just made a few observations the jungle keepers rangers got featured because they're the ones that spotted a pygmy marmoset that had previously been unrecorded on the river mhmm i got to i got to contribute because i had i had the only photograph that i believe anyone has of an emperor tamarin on this river it's the first proof of emperor tamarin on this river and that's exciting it's exciting because you know you'll you can post post a picture or share a scientific observation or write about something and then what happens is you get these these like couch experts these armchair experts who who will come and say you know no no you don't get blue and yellow macaws there i can tell from my bird book it says they're not there and they'll tell you you're wrong you know no you don't get wooly monkeys there or or emperor temperance it's like but but we but we have proof and so we're coming together to try and add to that knowledge my general sort of amateur experience of the species i've encountered here is like this should not exist whatever this is this is not real this is cgi like what just the colors the weirdness i mean there's i think i called it the the paris hilton caterpillar because it's like fur it looks like a it sounds like paris hilton's dog like yeah yeah it it's like really furry and it's transparent and and and sort of it's transparent all you see is this white beautiful fur and it's just like this caterpillar it doesn't doesn't look real yeah do you think there are species like how many species have we not discovered and is there species that are like extremely badass that we haven't discovered yet if you look up how many trees are in the amazon rainforest it's something in the order of four hundred billion trees there's something like seventy to eighty thousand species of plants individual types of plants here fifteen hundred species of trees it's it's so vast that it it it it's comparable like the the the scale is like only comparable to the universe in terms of stars and galaxies and and and and for the sheer immensity of it and so we're we're we're describing new species every year and just walking on the trail at night you and i have seen you know you see a tiny little spider hidden in a crevice and has the scientific eye ever seen that spider before has it been documented do we know anything about its life cycle there's still so much that's here that is completely unknown you know we have pictures of all these butterflies somebody went out with a butterfly net and caught these butterflies took a picture of it gave it a name put it in a butterfly book what do we know what host plant do they use for their caterpillars what's their geographical range what what do we actually know not that much so are there creatures out here that haven't been described absolutely and some of them could be extremely effective predators in a niche environment yeah absolutely i mean certainly certainly in the canopy fifty percent of life in a rainforest is in the canopy and we've had very limited access to the canopy for all of history you know if you wanted to get up into the rainforest canopy you basically have to climb a vine or with scientists when i was a kid i always used to see them with like the slingshots or the bow and arrows they would they would shoot a a piece of paracord over a branch pull the rope up and then you know do the ascension thing and then you're up in this tree getting swarmed by sweat bees getting stung by wasps you're trying to do science up there in that environment it's incredibly hostile and so having canopy platforms i actually met a guy at a french film festival who had used hot air balloons mhmm to float over the canopy of the amazon and then lay these big nets over the over the broccoli of the of the trees and the nets were dense enough that humans could walk on the nets and then reach through and pull cactuses and lizards and snakes whatever just take specimens from the canopy that's how difficult it is that that scientists have resorted to using hot air balloons mhmm and so having a treehouse having canopy platforms having it's it's starting to get there's starting to be more and more access to the rainforest canopy and so we're beginning to log more data you know we've even observed in our tree house which is supposed to be the tallest in the world we're seeing lizards that we don't see on the ground lizards that have never been documented on this on this river like we're seeing snakes where they're saying we saw the snake inside a crevice on that tree in the strangler fig and we don't know what it is it's just people haven't been up there and that's where a lot of the monkeys are that's where there's just a lot of dynamic life up there yeah i mean you when you wake up in the canopy in the morning in the amazon rainforest as soon as that the darkness lifts as soon as that purple comes in the east in the morning the howler monkeys start up yeah and then the parrots start up and then the tinamous start going and then the macaws start going and pretty soon everybody's going and the spider monkey groups are all calling to each other and it's just the whole dawn chorus starts and it's so exciting so you're saying when they're screaming it's usually about sex sex or territory usually mhmm sex and violence sex or implied violence or the threat of violence yeah i mean howler monkeys in the morning they're letting other groups know this is where we're at we're gonna be foraging over here you better stay away and so it's it's a little bit respectful as well there's order in the chaos so just speaking of screaming macaws are like these beautiful creatures they're lifelong partners they stick together so there's you all can see just they're monogamous so you see two of them together but when they communicate their love language seems to be very loud screaming yeah what what do you learn about relationships from a cause that that it can be loud and rough and still be loving and still be loving but is that interesting to you that there's like monogamy in some species that they they're lifelong partners and then there's like total lack of monogamy in other species it's all interesting i mean there's the anti monogamy crew who's like you know we were never meant to be monogamous we're supposed to just be animals and then there's the other side of the crew that's like we were meant to be monogamous we are monogamous creatures that's what god wanted between a man and a woman and then other people like yeah but i know about these two gay penguins and so that's natural too and so then everyone tries to draw their their identity they're trying to to justify monogamous really doesn't have anything to do with anybody except for that it's beneficial for them to work together to raise chicks it's difficult mhmm they rely on ironwood trees or aguaje palms and it's difficult to find the right hole in a tree there's only so much macaw real estate and so they need to use those holes and each one of those ancient trees it's usually five hundred years or more is a is a is a valuable macaw generating site in the forest and so if those trees go down you lose exponential amounts of macaws and that's how you get endangered species and so that's why we're trying to protect the ironwood trees another ridiculous question tell me if every jungle creature was the same size oh boy who would be the new apex predator the new alpha at the top of the food chain dude that's like super smash brothers of the jungle that's incredible yeah like bullet ants if you had a bullet ant that was the size yeah can it be like like a tournament so everyone is pound for pound ratioed yeah for efficiency so you have basically like a six foot bullet ant versus a a huge black cayman versus an anaconda versus an ocelots or the size of jaguars versus yeah well let's let's go bullet ant versus black caiman same size comparable size i don't know man i never thought about it i mean bullet ant has these giant yeah giant giant mandibles it could probably grab the black caiman and then at that amount of venom you're talking about a bucket of venom going into that black caiman black caiman's gonna get paralyzed immediately well insects have just a just a tremendous amount of like strength i don't know how they generate or the geometry that is the natural world can't create that same kind of power in the bigger thing it seems like it seems like yeah it seems like ants and like just these tiny creatures are the ones that are able to have that much strength i don't know how that works what the physics of that is ant a leafcutter ant lifting that leaf that doesn't make any sense yeah it doesn't make any sense any sense i i don't know i don't know if that's the limit of physics i think it's just the limit of evolution of how that that works one of the most interesting limits that i heard somebody talking about recently was the reason that dinosaurs didn't get bigger even bigger because that's the the the the conditions on earth were favorable towards it was that at some point their eggs reached this physical limits that their eggs reached a size the eggs were so big that that eggs need to breathe for the embryo to survive and their eggs reached a limit where in order to have a shell that could hold the mass of the liquid and and the young dinosaur if they got bigger it wouldn't be permeable anymore mhmm and i thought that was so interesting because the entire size of physical creatures was determined by how thick shell can be before it breaks or before it can't pass air through it yeah there might be a lot a lot of the like biophysics limits to you know fascinating stuff just like the the interplay between biology chemistry and physics of like a life form because like this thing there's a lot involved in creating a single living organism that could survive in this world and bigger you know being big is not always good but being a big creature it's for many reasons like you were saying the big creature seems to be going extinct yeah for many reasons but in in the human world it's because there seem to be of higher value given the current size of the jungle i think that the the mvp the pound for pound goat is ocelots you're talking about like a midsize forty forty fifty pound cat that can climb that does unlike a jaguar jaguar every time it hunts it's going after a deer it catches a deer the deer could hit it with its with its antlers it could tear it with its hooves it's risking its life mhmm for that meal an ocelot ocelots walk around at night and they climb a tree eat a whole bunch of eggs eat the mother bird too kill a snake maybe mess around and eat a baby came and they can have whatever they like and they're they're sleek enough and and smart enough to get away from predators they don't really have predators mhmm and so they're sort they sort of occupy this perfect niche where they they can hunt small prey in high quantity without taking on big risks and so if you had to choose an animal to be it would probably be like an ocelot or i would say giant river otters which are so damn cool because they're the locals call them lobos de rio river wolves because they're so tough and they're so social and they're so like us because they're intensely familial groups they live in holes by the sides of lakes and swim through the water and they catch fish all day long piranhas they eat them just like the scales go flying as they eat these piranhas and they're so joyous in the way they swim and they have friends and they have family and they i think it would be i think we could relate to being a river otter really because i can't picture being a cat mhmm and being so solitary and just marching along a fifteen mile route and making sure there's no other cats in in in coming in on your territory and marking that territory it seems it seems very solo and very cat like it's a lonely existence lonely existence and we humans are social beings we're so social and so to me river otters is like having a big italian family you're like constantly eating you're freaking out you're just like causing problems with the black cayman take down a black cayman yeah start a street fight so yeah yeah yeah it's a family thing you mentioned piranhas yeah what what do you think you know they're they're a source of a lot of fear for people what what do you find beautiful and fascinating about these creatures they're also kind of social or at least they hunt and operate in groups yeah not in the mammalian way though piranhas are in large schools but i fish are so different like if you yeah i can talk to you all day about how how much i'd love to be an otter also yeah going back to the fighting thing otters and weasels muscle a day tend to be very loose in their skin so if you grab an otter it can still rotate around to bite you so it's like if i grab you by the back you you're stuck you know like we can't you grab them by the skin yeah they can rotate around and just shred you apart so they're they're really cool fighters piranha fish fish i don't i don't you know i don't identify with fish in in terms like that i think living out here has made me think of fish as kind of rapid food that can or can't be gotten like you know mhmm so to me a piranha is just is when i see a piranha i think about how i wanna how i want it to taste yeah so like fish is a is a food source for so many creatures in the jungle so they're primarily a food source but piranhas are i mean they they're predators they're serious predators they are serious predators i found a baby black came in not that long ago and he was missing all of his toes because the piranhas had eaten them off it was really sad he just had these stumps and he was swimming around the water and i was like you are not gonna make it he was like eight inches and he was such a cute little puppy he had those big eyes and i was just like man you already are missing all your toes i was like just a matter of time he now he can't get away so some big agami heron's gonna come and just nail him pop him down his throat and that's the end of that for the caiman i mean nature is metal nature sure as shit is metal bite off a little bit and and then makes you vulnerable and then that vulnerability is exploited by some other species and then that's it that's the end yeah but humans are are brutal too like like like that story we heard about that guy the other day who caught a stingray on a fishing hook chopped its tail off to make it safe for humans cut a piece of the stingray off so he could use it for bait and then threw the live fish back in the river like to me that is incomprehensible amounts of cruelty with with with flawed logic in every direction like if you're gonna use the thing as bait use it as bait if you're gonna remove its tail well then just kill it altogether yeah or if you wanna save the animal and not kill it then don't maim it before you return it to its it was such a weird yeah so we have we've been eating paco yeah in your time here yeah so we have we've been eating paco yeah in your time here fried paco is great amazing it's delicious full of nutrients you could tell it makes you healthy i feel like we have better workouts so that we can go harder in the jungle and so a few months ago in august when the river was down it was there was a day that the river was clear and a friend of mine victor who's who's married to a native girl he said it's time to go paco fishing and at the time we were stuck out here and we had no resupply everybody was busy and so everyone was demoralized the staff was hungry we were hungry and it really became this thing of like hey go catch us in paco mhmm they were working on the trails they were installing the solar we we were working hard and we didn't have food and so we went out to the river and what we did was we went upriver we camped on the beach and in the morning victor's wife was was canoeing with the with the paddle dead quiet don't let the paddle touch the wooden boat nikita was balanced in the middle of the thing victor's on the front with this huge fishing rod and i'm sitting there and he goes i'll catch the first one you catch the second one and he's got this huge fishing rod and a piece of half rotten meat from the day before and he's smacking it against the wall six am mhmm he's just letting it smack against the water and i'm going and we're floating down the river and i'm going this is not gonna work and we're floating and we're floating and a half hour passes and i'm going it's dawn i wanna go back to sleep i'm such i'm just not a morning person and all of a sudden a fish hits that line almost pulls this man off of his feet mhmm and he swings the thing in the fish comes on the boat and then i realized he's got a big metal mallet on the boat so that you could try to shut that fish off and it's this huge oar shaped thick muscular paco mhmm and as soon as i saw that fish i just thought wow the strongest of this species from millions of years have been swimming in this river and suddenly we've through this incredible combination of the boat and the and the and the cord and the hook none of which we made and the skill that he had from knowing how to fish a paco because otherwise there's no chance that you're getting that fish they hide they're very very suspicious of what you're doing we had gotten this fish onto the boat and ploom you hammer it like a caveman boom doesn't die boom you have to crush its skull and now you have this fish and you're you're holding this genetic material this sustenance for your life that has been developing since the dinosaur times it's so beautiful the act the sacred act of eating that of of the fish of the competition with the fish and we spent the morning fishing we got three pacos three huge giant vegetarian piranha and i i just remember touching them with so much reverence thinking about the incredible history and how that before these rivers existed those pacos were were swimming through the water and and and and trying to survive through through through history through history through history until this until we we took just a few and we did it respectfully and we did it when we needed it most not at a time when it was just for fun and it was it was really really special well humans using them for sustenance there's a collaboration there that's that's something also that i've seen in the jungle that there's creatures using each other and it's like a dance of either mutually using each other it's or it's parasitic or symbiotic it's interesting like there's a a medicinal plant you grabbed that was full of ants yeah that were like trying to murder you by biting but they were defending the plant that they were using for whatever purpose there's a clear dance there of the ants using the plant and the plant existing there for other applications and other use for humans and there's that kinda circle of life happening but the ants were defense so the the plant didn't have its own defense mechanism the ants the army of ants was there to protect the plant mhmm and did you actually when you remember we put our backpacks down at that one spot and it was like the ants got on your backpack and i said oh shit this is that tree did you actually get bitten by one of those because they're incredibly painful the tangerana one they're like yeah yeah surprisingly painful because they're small there there's nothing like luckily i have not been bitten by a bullet ant yet but it's just it's amazing because they live inside the tree the tree comes standard with holes in it that allow the ants to to move and to exist safe and it protects their eggs and they protect the tree and they so we saw that spot where there's a perfect circle around the trees because the ants had excavated the other vegetation so that those trees could have no competition to grow the incredible calculation of how ants know to guard come programmed to garden that tree and the tree somehow has been genetically informed to have ant habitat within itself it's it's it's mind blowing and it actually is the foundation of a lot of existential confusion for me because how the hell is this possible yeah well one of the things you mentioned that's also a source of a lot of existential confusion for me is ants yeah and the intelligence of different creatures in the forest there's these giant colonies there's just giant systems but even just looking at a single colony of ants them collaborating leafcutter ants is an incredible system so individually the ants seem kind of dumb and simplistic mhmm but taken together there is a vast intelligence operating that's able to be robust and resilient in any kind of conditions is able to figure out a new environment is able to be resilient to any kinds of attacks and all that kind of stuff what do you find beautiful about them like as you said just leafcutter ants in this jungle that's forgetting all the other hundreds of species of ants that are in this jungle but just the leafcutters apparently digest roughly seventeen percent of the total biomass of the forest everything all these giant trees all that leaf litter seventeen percent of that almost a fifth of this forest cycles through leafcutter ant colonies so they're constantly regenerating the forest they're a huge source of the of the driver of this ecosystem and so to me when you see them working it's again like i said you see your friends as you go through the jungle you see all the kapok trees you see kinea tree you so there's leafcutter ants doing what they're supposed to do and it's it's just so beautiful i find them very beautiful army ants they're so tough they're so ready to fight they have the huge mandibles they're just ready to they're just they're transporting their eggs they're moving from here to there anything that's in the way is getting eaten they're just savage mhmm and they're kinda cute for that unless you're tied to a tree the savagery is cute i find that yes that's kind of reassuring you know you want certain things to be tough that's their part oh that everybody plays a part in the entirety of the in the nature mechanism yeah yeah powerful play but but but yeah but the army ants are so savage you know like if you if you step on army ants they will all kamikaze and just attack onto your feet and they'll just they'll just sacrifice their own life for the good of the thing mhmm and they'll be trying to kill your your shoes and there's something funny about that to me there's something like kinda reassuring again unless unless imagine if you're going through the jungle and you slip and you fall and you twist your knee yeah and you fall in just the right way but you you can't get up yeah you can't you're stuck there yep and then army ants find you yep they will take you apart there are records of horses that have been tied up and army ants come and they'll take out the whole horse imagine the pain of that it might be raining on us very hard very soon you wanna pause nope i think we'll stay here until the ship goes down we we should mention that there's this one source of light and we're shrouded in darkness and and now the night shift is gonna take over soon and we are in the amazon rainforest what does the rainforest represent to you when you zoom out look at the entirety of it carl sagan's pale blue dot resonated with a lot of people that everything you've ever heard of all the heroes all the villains all of your ancestors every achievement tragedy triumph everything has happened on that one spot this one tiny tiny little rock that has life on it and to me the rainforests represent the crown jewel of that as far as we know and to the best of our knowledge and with our shrewd scientific brains at their fullest capacity this is still the only place that we know that has life and given that the fact that there are still these tropical towering complex ecosystems that we are barely understand crawling and full of the most incredible life is just to me it's it's it's so wonderful it's so barely believable like if you were to theoretically tell a hypo hypothetical alien that i live on this planet and there there's just these places where everything is interconnected everything means something to something else and the whole thing is this system that keeps us alive and each tree is pumping air into the river and there's an invisible river above the actual river -and the whole thing goes into stabilizing our global climate and each little tiny leafcutter ant somehow contributes to this giant biotic orchestra that keeps us alive and makes our environment possible that is beautiful i love that and so the the rainforest to me are the greatest celebration of life and probably the greatest challenge for us as a global society because if we can't protect the crown jewel the best thing you know the most beautiful part then then we're really really missing the point yeah the diversity of organisms here is the biggest celebration of life that is at the core of what makes earth a really special thing that said you and i have been arguing about aliens for pretty much the day i showed up alright so you you brought a machete to this fight luckily the table is long enough to i can't reach you you can't reach me see to you earth is truly special yeah you don't think there's other earths out there millions of other earths in our galaxy when you look up you know we were sitting in the amazon river okay at dark the storm rolled over yeah and you started counting the stars yeah one two and that was once you can count the stars that was a sign that the storm will actually pass eventually it'll pass and that's what you're doing three four five and it's going to pass you're not gonna have to sit in that river for like all night so just a couple hours to keep yourself warm okay each of those stars mhmm there's earth like planets around them okay why do you think there's not alien civilizations there you can write down a calculation on a napkin you can cite different hollywood movies you can point up to the pieces of light in the stars but if you if i talk about show me a single cell that's not from this planet yeah it's still not possible and so i agree with you that the likelihood is there all indications point to it it would be fascinating especially if it was done in especially you know imagine finding a a planet of alternative life forms not necessarily even intelligent imagine just a part of a planet of butterflies whatever you know something else that would be amazing but but i'm concerned with the reality that we have in front of us is that this is the spaceship this is life yeah and so right now given that reality maybe that's maybe that's the case maybe maybe there are other planets or or maybe we are the first maybe life originated here maybe god the universe whatever maybe maybe this is it this is the this is the this is the the testing ground for something bigger and and and and this complexity and this diversity of life and this life that we have is that important and i think that part of what we do when we go oh yeah but there's other planets we're first of all we're we're we're taking an assumption into reality without i mean you know aliens right now are about as real as santa claus we think they're out there but we're not sure maybe a little more real because you know it could make sense we no one has an alien no one's seen an alien no one's even seen cellular life and so i'm not again if they showed up tomorrow great let's study them but right now we have this very simple threat going on where we can't stop killing each other and our living environment and so while some people can specialize in looking to the stars and to other planets and talk about being an interplanetary species i'm very much concerned with the fact that here in our home turf our living environment where the air is good and the rivers are clean and the trees are big and there's macaws flying through the sky and salmon in the rivers not only do we have a responsibility to each other and to our children to protect this incredible gift that is our entire reality seems kind of weird to at some point it conservation seems kind of ridiculous like you're begging people to not pollute the things that keep them alive it's it's it's almost kind of silly at a point but but we have this incredible thing where there are fish in the ocean and in the rivers they come standard with life on earth and and we're we're we're harming the ability of earth's ecosystems to provide for that life and we are the generation that's gonna decide if those systems continue to provide life to all the people on earth and all the generations and by the way all the other animals that exist for their own reasons other consciousnesses that we're just beginning to understand elephants humpback whales whatever families of giant river otters you not everything can be seen from a human perspective these are other species that have their own stories and so i'm i'm more biocentric than an anthropocentric in that i i i think that that nature is important but i also believe that we are we are special we are the most intelligent animal so one i i agree with you there's some degree to which when you imagine aliens you forget if by for a moment how special and important life is here on earth yes but it's also a way to reach out through curiosity in trying to understand what is intelligence what is consciousness what is exactly the thing that makes life on earth special another way of doing that and i see the jungle in that same way is basically treating the animals all around us the life forms all around us as kinds of aliens as that's a humbling way that's a intellectual humility with which to approach the study of like what the hell is going on here this is truly incredible like are are the animals we've met over the last few days conscious what is the nature of their intelligence what is the nature of their consciousness what motivates them are they individual creatures or are they actually part of the large system and how large is the system is earth one big system and humans are just little fingertips of that system or are each of the individual animals really the key actors and everything else is in the emergent complexity of the system so i think thinking about aliens is a necessary i like my tom with a little drop of poison from tom waits is a necessary perturbation of the system of our thinking to sort of say hey we don't know what the fuck's going on around here sure and aliens is a nice way to say okay the mystery all around us is immense because to me likely aliens are living among us not in a trivial sense little green men but the force that created life i think permeates the entirety of the universe that there is a force that's creative now the force that created life is a is a big one and then the other thing is what do you mean by that there's aliens living among us you mean extraterrestrials yes living among us yes you believe that not like a hundred percent but there's a there's a good percentage i don't understand how it's possible for there not to be a very large number of alien civilization throughout the just our galaxy but that's different than saying that they're living among us if you tell me that there's aliens living five galaxies over and that they're just out there somewhere i'm kinda i'm kinda more on your side then that they're here because just like bigfoot like we have camera traps we have dna sequencing through through water now like we can you're telling me no one found one wingnut of a of a of a ship in all like the egyptians up until right now no one in russia saw like a a crashed ship took a picture tweeted that shit real quick and you know i i think there's no bigfoot there's no trivial manifestations of aliens i think if they're here they're here in ways that are not comprehensible by humans because they're far more advanced than humans they're far more advanced than any life forms on earth so they're even if it's just their probes we cannot just even comprehend it i think it's possible that they operate in the space of ideas for example that ideas could be aliens feelings could be aliens consciousness itself could be aliens so we can't restrict our understanding what is a life form to a thing that is a biological creature that operates via natural selection on this particular planet it could be much much much more sophisticated it could be in a space of computation for example as we in the twenty first century are developing increasingly sophisticated computational systems with artificial intelligence it could be operating on some other level that we can't even imagine it could be operating on a level of physics that we have not even begun to understand we we barely understand quantum mechanics we use it quantum mechanics is a way we use to make very accurate predictions but to understand why it's operating that way we don't and there's so many gigantic powerful cosmic entities out there that we detect sometimes can't detect dark matter dark energy but it's out there we know it exists but we can't explain why and what the fuck it is we give it names black holes and dark energy and dark matter but those are all names for things that mathematical equations predict but we don't understand and so all of that is just to say that aliens could be here in ways that are for now and maybe for a long time going to be impossible for humans to understand so aliens in the in the strict biological sense like like like like horseshoe crabs we agree that they're they're not we haven't found physical aliens the only way i can imagine finding physical aliens is if alien species are trying to communicate with us humans or with other life forms and are trying to figure out a way to communicate with us such that we dumb humans would understand like let's create a thing yo there's a moth the size the size of a small eagle that's trying to get us fifty minutes of attention it just might it just might big fan of the podcast okay lex i love you alright so so what you're wouldn't it be interesting it would be really fascinating to me if we found out that there were aliens living among us and we couldn't see them and what some of the people were calling aliens the scientists the the religious people were calling angels and then everybody had this realization that whether you call them aliens or angels there are these other there is more way more to the universe than we're realizing mhmm i just for me the fact that there's there's a skull on the table yeah there's a skull on the table skull in your hand there's now a skull in my hand of a monkey with a bullet in its head that i found on the floor of an indigenous community where they eat monkeys i didn't kill the monkey so save your comments but you know in terms of of the animals i think i think that when i see space it my feeling and i'm not requiring anybody else to have this feeling but because we know because it's the only place that we know that there's life and we have no idea how it started i just think it's so important to protect it and and and for me it's just as much about our children as it is about the little spider monkeys and the little baby came in that are in the river right now because life is so beautiful yeah and i think that there's a huge amount of intellectual responsibility that we can transfer off of ourselves if we go yeah the rivers are filled with trash and yeah extinction is happening but we have to be an interplanetary species anyway because at any moment this could all end from an asteroid and like everything's going to shit anyway and so it's like we're fucking up this planet and it's like that's we're just being angry teenagers who are you know going goth for a while and it's like what if you just rolled up your sleeves and said holy shit wait a second you know we can pretty much do whatever we want we can fly all over the world we have we can do heart transplants we can watch netflix in the amazon if we wanted to like we could do all this amazing stuff we can capture on video or adventures and go back and watch them again and again and again there's so much incredible opportunity that technology has allowed us to do and we're the we're the richest in history i mean we could do everything we could cross the whole planet in a second and it's like that's an amazing time to be alive and if we just don't fuck up the ecosystems and kill all the other animals we got it made yeah so it is true that we can destroy ourselves in nuclear weapons but it also is true that that snake that i got to handle yesterday is like one of the most beautiful things earth has ever created in the in that little organism it is encapsulated the entire history of earth and it's it's beautiful so both things are true yeah we should we should worry about the existential destruction of human civilization through the weapons we create and we should become multi planetary species as a backup for that purpose but also remember that this place is is really really special and probably if not difficult probably impossible to recreate elsewhere and by the way there's something incredibly powerful about a skull yeah if you ever hold a human skull it it'll give you it'll it'll it'll it'll weigh on you for a sec because you look into this the hollow eyes of this face and suddenly you go you feel your own teeth you feel your own skull and you go holy shit you go what is going on it's like taking acid you just go oh boy mhmm i forgot that i'm a ghost inhabiting a meat vehicle on a floating rock but even even a monkey yeah it's like looking at a ancestor you know not a direct ancestor but there's a it's like a you know like you you look in a puddle at a reflection mhmm a little blurry but it's still there blurry but it's still there yeah it's still there and like the roots of who we are is still there and it's it's all kind of incredible do you ever think of the the tree of life just kinda like where we came from yeah the jungle is ephemeral it just keeps it's a system that just keeps forgetting because it's just churning and churning and churning and churning has in some ways no history but to create the jungle to create life on earth there's a deep history of lots of death sex and death a festival of sex and death life on earth that's what i see in the skull yeah there's something it's there's something kind of terrifying about that image to me like when i hold that skull every now and then at night you hold that skull and you it just reminds you that you're temporary yeah both you and i will one day have one of those yeah mine will be bigger my god the male competition continues the silverback slaps the lesser male once again do you have a lighter yeah bro you wanna light this blunt yeah what are your favorite animals to interact with i mean my favorite absolute favorite animal to interact with is one hundred percent elephants which there's no elephants here but i've been incredibly privileged to to spend some time with elephants both in india and in africa and i think that they're so smart and so complex that we do a really bad job of understanding what an elephant really is mhmm i think that most children probably think of elephants as like something kinda cuddly most adults probably think of have a a similar misconception of them when you see an elephant when you see a twelve foot tall bull elephant with bone coming out of its face with huge tusks and those giant it's a it's a octopus faced butterfly eared behemoth that's a survival machine and it'll look at you and just go do i have to kill you to keep safe and it's just they're so tough and they have they have dirt on their back and they flower petals and their little hair you realize they have hair all over their body and the the power to throw a car over to flip it just one of the most impressive animals on earth and i think that i've gotten really good at interacting with wild elephants in a way that's respectful to them and i think that that when an elephant allows you to be in its space it's because you're you're showing submissiveness and and respect for the elephant space and they're so intelligent that they're communicating with seismic vibrations through the earth that they have you know a matriarchal society that they can remember the maps of their ancestors and they know how to find water that they can solve problems they're they're such beautiful animals and they're so talk about aliens they're so alien looking mhmm these big so weird heads and the trunks with all those muscles and they're so different than us but but yet i actually think that we we grew up together you know they they they kinda raised us sibling species that we we've been we've inhabited the same epoch in history and and we've relied on the ecosystems that they've created and i think that they have a deep understanding of humans elephants and i think i see them more like aliens more like non human beings that we share the earth with so i don't see it as we're humans and they're animals i actually see elephants as a as sort of a separate society along with humans as one of the dominant species on the planet so almost every species especially the intelligent ones especially the big ones are their own societies that overlap and sometimes co develop yeah i think whales i think elephants i think there's there's those higher you know no one's suggesting that sardines are you know somehow need human rights or something but i think the elephants need representation in governments because they're they occupy they they influence their landscape they engineer their environment they have emotions they have families they have burial rituals they're so like us mhmm and yet we treat them like they're just just oversized cows that we have to be scared of it's they're not they're not the same as as domesticated livestock they're one of the treasures of earth i mean look let's just say little green men showed up mhmm and you said they said well what's earth it's like well there's mountains there's rivers it's like well how how do i do this you know there's mountains rivers there's there's elephants like it's like one of the first things a baby learns is elephant even if he's never seen one it's just so iconic on earth like you said darren aronofsky darren aronofsky the the elephant walking over the camera i haven't seen it you said it's incredible yeah so at the sphere the postcard from earth i mean it's a celebration of earth yeah in all forms and one of the critical big creatures in that film is an elephant and steps over the audience and the whole like the whole steer reverberates that power i mean some of it is size yeah some of it is like how did earth create this it is a weird looking creature but we take it for granted because we've accepted that this earth can't create this kind of thing but it is weird beautifully weird oh it's beautifully weird i mean i mean elephants there's something really impressive and and wise about them yeah there's also beautiful weird that isn't so that doesn't come with so much grandeur like to me a giraffe is beautifully weird yeah but they're just you know they're eighteen foot tall camel deer things with you know giant necks and they're strange and they're they're absolutely serenely beautiful but they don't they don't have that deep intelligence that that elephants have there's something that elephants have do you see in their eyes where's how does the intelligence manifest itself well this is the thing a lot of people a lot of the when i was reading frans de waal's book a lot of what he was saying was that you know people give elephants human problems to solve mhmm in controlled environments and call it you know a study on elephant intelligence whereas if you're watching wild elephants mhmm and you're in the wild you're gonna be watching them in a way that they're they're looking you've pulled up in a safari vehicle or you've pulled over to the side of the road and the elephants are wary of you so they're not acting natural mhmm but as soon as you start watching wild elephants truly in the wild and comfort comfortable with your presence you see how they start caring for their babies or or how they can get annoyed i once watched elephants around the waterhole and there's this warthog and i don't know why but this warthog decided he needed to get in and and there was this young male elephant and he kept turning around to this warthog and just being like don't make me do it now this elephant did not need to hurt the warthog yeah and the warthog was just like i need a drink i need a drink i need a drink much simpler brain mhmm the elephant was like you could just tell he was like watch this and he just went and crushed the warthog like it was a big beetle yeah and crushed his pelvis and the warthog dragged itself away on its front legs and probably went off to die but this young elephant put out his ears and he like paraded around with his tail off and he was like look what i did destruction and it's like that's a very relatable type of he was annoyed with the warthog hawk yeah and and and and so you see them do these things mhmm i mean the most magical thing and i've i've spoken about this many times was that i was walking with a herd of semi wild elephants that were crossing through a village in india because elephants have lost a lot of their territory because there's so much so so much population in india and so we're crossing through a village which is very delicate because the matriarchs are leading the babies and there's villagers who have no idea what an elephant is and they're watching the elephants cross and the matriarchs backed this girl up against the wall and she was terrified standing there with her back against the wall and and the elephant just put her trunk out and touched the girl's stomach and then the other elephants came and they all started touching her stomach and the the the ranger there explained to me just went she's pregnant they know she's pregnant they can smell they can tell and they're curious and they all the all the female elephants came to investigate the pregnant girl and she had no idea what was going on and so it's like that stuff that stuff and it's cool to hear that you know with the the the crushing and the pride of the young elephant that there's a complexity of behavior it's just like with humans i mean you know humans always pretty that's the thing man humans are capable of good and evil and sometimes we attach these words i love that there's just it's an orchestra of different sounds yeah and that one is sex or which that's a bamboo rat calling out for a mate a mate yeah all right good luck talk to you buddy good hunting you know humans are capable of evil things and beautiful things and i wonder if animals are the same you you think there's just different personalities and different life trajectories for animals like as they develop in their understanding of social interaction of survival of maybe even primitive concepts of right and wrong within the social system do you think there is a lot of diversity in personalities and and behavior just like different people is there different elephants of course and and what i really like is as you said is there a perception of what's right and wrong because elephants have a code of ethics and so as the for the simplest example is that as young males begin to grow they start developing these tusks and those tusks are a tool and they use them so for indian elephants the females don't have tusks and the males do the females kick the males out of the herd the females keep all the sisters and the ants and the and the and the and the cousins together but the males are their own thing and so here's the thing if you have so what you get is these these crews of male elephants and the older males will you know there's play fighting that goes on around you know two young males can play fight but the older males they'll kick some ass they'll show them how to behave mhmm they'll explain who gets to talk to the females who gets to interact who gets to mate who gets the best vegetation to eat and so there's an order established and so young male elephants have to be taught how to act just like a teenage human has to be taught you know you can't just haul off and and break another kid's nose you gotta there's gonna be consequence maybe you'll get suspended mhmm or maybe that kid will get his friends and beat the living shit out of you whatever it is society regulates your behavior and elephants have a very strict very predictable sort of like the males teach the males how to run things and the females which which really have the final say they're matriarchal they're the ones leading the herd where to go the males follow where the where the wise females tell them where to go so that regulation mechanisms from that emerges a kind of moral system under which they operate what's right and wrong for an elephant yeah for an elephant right and wrong for an elephant is not the same as what's right and wrong for grizzly bear grizzly bear if you're a male grizzly bear and you see a female with cubs you just kill those cubs and then you can mate with that you can mate with her and put your own cubs in there and it's like that's a whole different type of ethics yeah the value of child life is different yeah from species to species some of them hold the sacred some of them not at all and that's why i think i i resonate so much with elephants because they're i think they're i think that we're we're we're we are kind of matriarchal at least i grew up matriarchal like women were the force in my life my family and most of my friends' families and women kinda have the final say and i feel like that's the way it is with with with with elephants like you might be bigger and stronger but it doesn't really account for much if you're not smarter and and more emotionally intelligent and you know how to take care of the group just to zoom out into the ridiculous questions as we were talking about aliens there's a lot of people trying to understand trying to study the origin of life oh i love this first of all what do you think is life versus nonlife like when you look at like ants or even like the simplest simplest of organisms we saw a frog in the stream yesterday that was like a leaf frog it was like as flat as a sheet of paper and it does a lot of weird things and it found a way to exist in this world but that's a single living organisms with a bunch of components to it but like there's a life form that exists in this world what is the difference between that and a rock what what is like what is the essence of that life this might be an unanswerable question there's probably a chemistry physics biology way of answering that like what to you is that i i i think to me life is something that grows in response to stimuli like in basic biology one zero one i think and i'm fine with that i don't need it to be more romantic than that but i think it's actually comical how how do you get from a rock to an orangutan mhmm you know and and our answer for that is primordial soup maybe there was just stuff on earth and then the the the stuff just got up and started walking maybe there just there was nothing happening and then there was all of a sudden there was a cell mhmm and the cell had functioned and then it complexified and then it started reproducing and found male and female parts and and what like it we we are so under equipped to understand how the hell we got here let alone ants or or or even bacteria i see this so many in very simple mathematical models like something called game of life their cellular automata you could see from simple rules and simple objects when they're interacting together as you grow that system complex objects arise like that emergence of complexity is not understood by science by mathematics at all and it seems like from primordial soups you can get a lot of cool shit and the force of getting from soup to like two humans on microphones yeah not understood and it seems to be a thing that happens on earth i tend to think that it's a thing that happens everywhere in the universe and there's some deep force that's pushing this along in some way that there's something we i don't want to sort of simplify it but there is something that creates complexity out of simplicity that we don't quite understand and that's the thing that created the first organism living organism on earth that like leap from no life to life on earth that's a weird one that's a weird one because you can imagine i think that what the earth is four four point five billion years old and you can imagine just this this rock of a planet with like rain and storms and elements and iron and granite and like just random stuff it's pretty easy to imagine that but then i remember that book there we think we all had the same book when we were kids and then like they show this like fish like animal crawling out of a mhmm out of the primordial soup and it's like bro you just missed the most important part author of that book bro and and i think the first bacteria came in around three three three point seven billion years ago so there's like at least like you know a bunch of billion years where there's just nothing there's just a planet and then we start seeing fossils of the first bacteria mhmm and the bacteria stuck around for long time for a long time a billion two billion years it's just very very long just bacteria just bacteria but a lot of them a lot of them there's probably a lot of innovation a lot of murder a lot of interaction yeah yeah and then i mean there's there's a bit a few big leaps along the history of life on earth yeah you know the predator prey dynamic that was a really cool innovation it's almost like innovation it's like featured on an iphone it's like it's nice like predator prey eukaryotes so complex multicellular organisms emerging from the water to land that was weird that was a that was a interesting innovation there's whatever led to humans that there's a lot of interesting stuff there i see i can't even get that far i can't get from rock and sand to cells yeah that's that's a huge oh yeah i mean i mean to everything around us that has cells is just it's it's wild even and i i could imagine being on another planet and how incredibly valuable this thing would be this this it's impossible to replicate it i'm looking at it through the candlelight right now and i can see all of the structures in this leaf the incredible structures in this leaf that look exactly like the veins in my arm which look exactly like the rivers that are flowing across this landscape and it's like life has this this overwhelming pattern that it uses and it's so beautiful i just i just think it's yeah when when you imagine the the the the days of the lightning and the volcanoes and the primordial soup it's it's there's a there's a big gap mhmm there and it's it's fascinating to think about and it's fascinating to see how different people's belief systems lead them to different answers there not to give any spoilers but postcard from earth or darren aronofsky's film the idea there is is there's probes that are sent out from earth oh that's true to all these other planets and each probe contains two humans a man and a woman uh-huh and those two humans are in love so think of a couple in love they're sent there with all the information basically a leaf that holds the information what it takes to create life on other planet to recreate an earth and other planets and the two humans hold all the information for the things that make life on earth special especially in human civilization is love consciousness the the the social connection so all that information is sent in the probe and the postcard from earth is those humans waking up remembering all the information that is earth that like a celebration of all the things that make earth magical throughout its history all the diversity of organisms all of that you're loading all that in to create life on that new planet which is something i think alien civilizations are doing they're sending probes all throughout the galaxy and they just haven't arrived yet but anyway that's another that's so beautiful and one of the things that i i think i i i wanna see that so much and one of the things that i love about aronofsky's work is is the fountain mhmm and what i find so beautiful about that is that now here he's saying okay we're sending probes out to other worlds alien civilizations and in the fountain it was sort of what i thought he did so beautifully was braid together those three stories where in one i don't remember if he's in a spaceship or if if that's supposed to be like his soul mhmm the other one he's a scientist in sort of like comparable times to hours and then he's the the the spanish explorer but either way there's the tree of life and it sort of braids together all of the major religions and it made me think of that quote that you hear where it says you know god what was it christ wasn't a christian and buddha wasn't a buddhist and mohammed wasn't a muslim they were all just teachers who were teaching love and it's like the fountain the fountain sort of says nature is the that driving force and it's our job to understand that the game is love and that's what that's what the main character in the fountain needs to learn is that it's that it's nature that's going to just that's going to carry your soul through this this this thing and that there's so much you don't understand in the epiphany at the end god i love that movie god i love that movie among many things you're also an artist who's trying to convert the thing that is nature into a thing that we humans can understand the complexity the beauty of it that's what darren aronofsky tried to do with those couple of films that's something that i hope you do actually in the medium of film too that would be very interesting and you do that in the medium of books currently how much do you think we understand about the history of life on earth i think we got it all wrong no i don't know it seems like they change it all the time you know they say they say that easter island you know when i was in college they were big on telling you that easter island they ruined their environment and the environmental collapse and that's why there's nobody on easter island it was a cautionary tale we could ruin our environment and now it seems like they've changed their mind on that and then when humans entered north america seems to be hugely up to speculation and you know the the africa spreading that we all spread out of africa and then the the pleistocene overkill extinction theory and it's like it seems like every few years they update it and they change it and they say oh the guys no no no no no the the guys from ten years ago actually my new theory is the best theory let's write some books and get me on letterman mhmm and it seems like there's a new prevailing theory that's really always exciting and edgy about how how we got here and where we came from and how we dispersed and maybe even has some political implications like mhmm how we should use the amazon moving forward like amazon was engineered by people so fuck it let's just cut it down yeah it's i i tend to believe that we mostly don't understand anything but there is an optimism in continuously figuring out the puzzle of that sure we offline talked about the the graham hancock flint dibble debate on on rogan i like debates personally yeah so flint dibble represents mainstream archaeology and i actually like the whole science the whole field of archaeology you're trying to figure out history with so little information you're you're trying to put together this this this puzzle when you have so little and you're desperately clinging on to little clues mhmm and from those clues using the simple possible explanation to understand and now with modern technology as as flynn was trying to express that you can use large amounts of data that's like imperfect but just the scale and using that to reconstruct civilizations there are different practices from the little details of what kind of things they eat how they interact with each other what kind of art they create to when they existed what are the time frames all that kind of stuff and that starts to fill in the gaps of our understanding but still the error bars are large in terms of what really happened and that leaves room for things like graham hancock talks about like lost civilizations which i like also because it gives you have a a kinda humility about maybe there's giant things we don't know about or we got completely wrong and that's always good to like remember it's confusing to me to imagine like what i don't even know what like what ended the where did the egyptians go like what happened to yeah seemed like they were doing so good they had so much cool shit but i mean i was reading anthropological stuff in the amazon about about tribes that you know just through through their societal structures and through their hunting practices that that didn't really develop practices that worked and kind of bands of people that went extinct before they could turn into larger societies and and there's there's a lot of people that got it wrong you know for every explorer that that that that leaves borneo and arrives in south america there's probably hundred maybe hundred more that just die at sea get eaten by sharks you know avalanche and it's just it's so fascinating to me that we all of us really past our grandparents don't really even know where we came from like do you know who your great great great grandparents are like no i mean there there's methods of trying to figure that out but really again the air bars are so large that it's almost like we're trying to create a narrative that makes sense for us you know that i'm i'm ten percent neanderthal therefore i can bench press this much and therefore my aggressive tendencies have a explanation when in reality there's so much diversity of personalities that they they far overshadow any possible histories we might have your aggressive tendencies don't have any explanation you're no you need to you listen to me right now i'm sorry don't hit me again don't choke me out again yeah man one of the things you and i talk a lot about is different explorers yeah who do you think is i'm just throwing a ridiculous question one after the other who do you think is the greatest explorer of all time oh god i love shackleton but i i hate the cold so i can't i i don't really i can't even read about it i hate the cold so much i can't i can't even go there for fun i think percy fawcett in the amazon was was was was the goat in terms of just sheer the last of the victorian era you know march forward go deeper just stop at nothing and then eventually take such big risks that you never come back it's it's hard for me to relate to that kind of exploration because to me i'm such a softie i wouldn't wanna like leave my family behind i wouldn't wanna like even if you told me that i could leave earth and go exploring and i could go touch the moon i'd be like nope absolutely not like the highway is dangerous enough like i would never risk dying in space this guy left his home went out into the jungle out there with horrendous gear compared to the camping gear we have today no headlamp and just explored for years on end well let me actually push back you have that explore there is definitely a thing in you just me having observed you behave in the jungle and in the world you're pulled towards exploration towards adventure towards the possibility of discovering something beautiful including like a small little creature or like a whole new part of the rainforest a part of the world that like is like holy shit this is beautiful i think that's the same kind of imperative so maybe not going out to the stars but like yeah like i could see you doing exactly the same thing so he disappeared in nineteen twenty five during an expedition to find an ancient lost city which he and other people believed exist in the amazon rainforest so there's that pull like yeah i'm going to go into there yeah with shitty equipment with the possibility of finding something and they said he ran into uncontacted tribes mhmm and started goofing off i think he started i think he started dancing and singing like the tribes were ready to kill him and he started goofing and like doing a song and a dance and just being ridiculous and the tribes were like what now mhmm and they're like wait wait wait wait wait don't shoot him yet that's a funny one yeah and they they actually he kinda like on a human level used used humor to save his own life on multiple occasions to the point where he deescalated the situation he was like look we're not here to fight we're here to we have a a pile of maps you know all my guys have beriberi dengue malaria like we're dying out here if you guys just go on your merry way we'll go on our merry way and like incredible he was so tough and then that guy from shackleton's expedition ended up on one of fawcett's expeditions and you go oh yeah he's a he's a proven explorer he's been through the antarctic and the guy was like fuck the jungle absolutely fuck the jungle he was like and and there's a great quote where he says without a machete and something you know i don't remember exactly the words he used but he said without a machete in this environment you don't last yeah and you know that now like you you in that tangle to just take three steps that way would i would immediately be taking on i mean i'm not wearing shoes right now yeah bullet ants venomous snakes spikes through my feet tripping over myself i don't have a headlamp unbelievable risk right there we're sitting on the edge of tragedy can you explain what the the purpose of the machete in this situation is like what what is a machete how does it work how does it allow you to navigate in this exceptionally dense environment so this is the tool that i spend most of my life carrying this is in my hand for ninety percent of my time and in the jungle you really need a machete there's so much plant life here that you have to cut your way through and like a jaguar an ocelot a lot of these other animals that are more horizontally based and low to the ground they can make it like when we got stuck in those bamboo patches and we were just hacking through them and it's dangerous and there's as you hit the bamboo it ricochets and there's spikes and then one piece falls and it pulls a train a vine that has spikes on it and that hits you in the neck and it just the jungle is savage to humans but if you are an agouti a little rodent mhmm or a jaguar or a deer you can kinda slip through this stuff and the deer have developed really small antlers they can just kinda weave through low to the ground and so and so for us being these vertical beings walking through the jungle it it really helps to be able to move the sticks that are diagonally opposing your movement at all times so a machete is just a very very useful tool it could help you pull thorns out of your body as you saw last night we can use it to find food mhmm you want machete fishing you cut a fish head off with a machete by like it was swimming and then you basically you know machete the water and the other fascinating thing about that fish without his head it kept moving so it was that was amazing was just using i guess his nervous system to to swim beautifully i mean i that there's so many questions there about how nature works okay well let's explain it because he the the way the machete hit this fish it kinda kinda took his just his his eyes off of and his lower jaw was still there so it was really just like the brain and and the little top jaw that came off and this fish as the the dust cleared in the stream this fish was i found it very haunting in a very like interstellar way like it was just the programming was still there but the brain was gone and the fish was just still moving and it was gonna die but it was still swimming and it looks like a live fish it was crap or something and you're still trying to catch it which is insane watching work to catch it because every time i caught it it would it would freak out and then it would jump back in the water and i'm programmed here from years and years of living in the amazon that everything can hurt you so you actually become quite you know if a moth lands on you you flick it because it could be a bullet ant and so even the fish here a lot of the fish here have spikes coming out of them and so even though i know that fish i know its name i've eaten them many times as i was holding it when it would twitch with that explosive power just like the cayman i would i would i would get that fear response and release it mhmm and so that happened three or four times before i finally said this is stupid even though he's slippery he hasn't got ahead i can hold on to him i put him in my pocket yeah we put him in my pocket and then we fried him up and we and he was delicious so and i'm grateful for his existence and for his role and for my existence on this planet this brief existence that i was able to enjoy that delicious delicious fish so the machete is used to cut through this extremely dense jungle there's vines by the way there's rope like things yeah they're extremely strong and they go all kinds of directions they go horizontal and all of this i i don't even how tree we have a tree right above us that makes no sense there's like a tree that kinda failed and then a new tree was created on top of it that makes it just makes no sense it feels like sometimes trees come from the from the sky sometimes they come from the ground i don't i don't really quite understand the how that works because there's new trees that grow on old trees and the old trees rot away and then new trees come up yeah that whole mechanism strangler figs and so strangler figs as you go across the world's ecosystems that whole belt of you know whether you're in rainforests in the amazon the congo indonesia all across the tropics you have strangler figs and the amazing thing that this that this species does it's become a keystone species across the planet with a hyper influence on its ecosystem wherever it is because they produce fruit in the dry season when the rest of the forest is making it hard for animals to find fruit to find food and so the bats the birds the monkeys they all go to the strangler fig they eat the fruit and the fruit of course is just tricking the animals the the the plants are tricking the animals into carrying their seeds to another tree and so they're getting free transportation monkey takes a poop on another tree after eating strangler figs and then that strangler fig sends out its vines gets to the ground and then as soon as it begins sucking up nutrients out competes that tree for light grows hyperdrive around the trunk of that tree mhmm and then eventually that tree will die and the strangler fig will win because it got a it got a boost up to the top whereas these little trees down here they're gonna have to wait their turn they have to wait until a tree falls until there's a light gap and then they have enough food to grow quick and so this whole thing is an energy economy everything is just trying to get sunlight and so strangler figs yeah top down trees growing or parasitic top down octopus trees growing over other giant trees and you've seen the size of some of the trees here so you know back to percy fawcett and exploration what what do you think it was like for him back then a hundred years ago goddamn going to the jungle well see the thing is those guys didn't go with the locals they came down here with like mules and they tried to do it their way yeah and so he's one of the people that wrote about the green hell the jungle as the oppressive war zone where there's nothing to eat and everything is killing you and it's i i think i think that that image is so wrong because as you saw last night we could go if we went out with jj right now we would machete fish some fish we could start a little fire we'd do it all in shorts like to to jj it's green paradise and it's intense but but if you know what you're doing which the local people surely do well then just beneath the sand there's turtle eggs that you can eat and inside the nuts on the ground there's grubs that you can eat and if you really needed to you could just jump on a cayman and eat that because their tails are pretty full of meat and it's like there's actually unending amount amounts of food here and so it's it's they were pretty you know they were strange bunch of people to tune in to the that frequency i feel like you're you and jj yeah are able to tune to the to the frequency of the jungle that is a a provider not a destroyer of human life right yeah like i think to be collaborated with not fought against yes but we're coming at that with a with our modern lens because we're coming down here with i've survived how many infections in the jungle where those probably would have killed me before yeah so my dead ass opinion of the jungle would have been overwhelming and collective murder as herzog says and so percy fawcett was coming down here with this view of it's trying to kill us at all times we are flying down here and coming out here with our superior medicines and our ability to survive infections and and so it's it is different for us it is different we're we're we're we're coming at this very very different but fawcett to me was like the last of like the real swashbucklers like the really batshit crazy explorers that just went out into the into the dark spaces on the map mhmm and it's very hard for me to identify with him but with for instance richard evans scholtes from harvard that's someone where you go okay now we're getting to the point where i can start to understand jimmy just like the conquistadors and they tell you the conquistadors showed up you know they killed the the spanish killed two thousand inca on the first day and then they they marched to this city and they're like when i hear about the can you imagine yourself just like slaughtering a bunch of women and children and and soldiers and then just like drinking some wine and doing it again tomorrow i can't actually wrap my head around that yeah it just seems like an entire different world nah like different world different value system i different value system different relationship with violence and life and death i think we value life more we value we resist violence more yeah like i i just i can't like if we saw a car acts i feel like if i saw a car accident like you know or if you see a little bit of war some violence like it affects you these people were so comfortable with those things yeah it was such a normal part of their the the spartans the the comanches like they became so comfortable with war to the point that it became what they did mhmm and they celebrated it too they celebrated it and direct violence too like taking that machete and murdering me or if i got to the machete first me murdering you not a chance bitch alright and then i would put it on instagram and show up and the number of dms i would get from murdering you with a machete meanwhile half the world right now is messaging me saying my dms are filled with take care of lex don't lose lex make sure lex comes back safe lex is a national treasure we love lex make sure he holds a snake the amount of love that is out there meanwhile i emerge from the jungle of blood around me with a machete and i take over your instagram account he's very humble he doesn't wanna hear about the love alright so what do you think makes a great explorer whether it's percy fawcett richard evan schultes by the way say who richard evan schulte is he's a biologist so that's another lens to wish to be an explorer yeah is to study the the biology the the the immense diversity of biological life all around us richard evans scholtes i know about him from reading wade davis's book one river which is this big hefty you know five or six hundred page tome about the amazon and it covers two stories it's richard evan schulte's and i think it's in the forties i think it's like pre world war two era where he's in the amazon looking for the blue orchid and the cure for this and that and he's pressing plants and he's going to these indigenous communities where they still live completely with the forest and they and they drink ayahuasca and they they talk to the gods and they he learns about how they believe that the anaconda came down from the milky way and swam across the land and created the rivers and sort of he came down and and and even though he was a western scientist from harvard he embraced the indigenous perspective on the world on creation on spirituality and and he he sort of resigned himself and gave himself fully to that and spent years and years traveling around parts of the amazon that had hardly been explored and certainly never been explored in the way he was doing it in the ethnobotanical spiritual way of of what medicinal compounds are contained in these plants and how do the local indigenous people use and understand them for example you know of eighty thousand species of plants in the amazon rainforest and four hundred billion trees in the amazon rainforest the statistics of likelihood that through trial and error that humans could discover ayahuasca it's i it's astronomical that one of these trees and a root when put together allow you to go access the spirit realm mhmm and see hallucinogenic shapes and and talk to the gods that's that's that's almost almost enough to inspire spiritual thought itself the fact that trial and error it would take like millions of years or something it's it's it's i forget what the figure is it's incredible but richard evan scholtes was one of the first people that came down and saw that and then one river is where wade davis comes back i believe in the seventies and the the heartbreak of the book is that all of these incredibly wild places with with nay naked native tribes and these these intact belief systems wade davis comes back in a lot of the same places that schultes went now there's missionary schools and they're wearing discarded nikes and you know whatever i don't know if there's nikes in the seventies but like western stuff has made it in they've been contacted domesticated forced into western society and you know a lot of them then forget the thousands and thousands of years the that have gone into creating the medicinal botanical knowledge that the indigenous possess about how to cure ear infections and how to treat illnesses from the medicinal compounds flowing through these trees is lost in a single generation with with the modernization yeah he he wrote the plants of the gods their sacred healing and hallucinogenic powers that is interesting you mentioned like how to discover that like how do you find those incredible plants those incredible things that can warp your mind in all kinds of ways of course physically heal but also like take you on a mental journey that's interesting so you don't think trial and error is possible i was reading about ayahuasca and they're saying they're saying statistically if if you know if a bunch if you put a thousand humans in the amazon and gave them villages to live in because humans are communal species it would take tens and tens of thousands of years or perhaps even centuries before even the possibility it's like that thing you know a bunch of chips on a keyboard have could they write ham hamlet it's like astronomical odds to get to oh wait this and this dosed together and so what the local people believe is that the gods revealed this secret through the jungle to us as a link to the spirit world and that that's how we know this because if they didn't remember it from their ancestors we would have no idea how to get this information from the wild so i will likely do iowasca what do you think exists in the spirit world that could be found by taking that journey i think that ayahuasca is i can only speak from personal experience and for me it was as if your brain is a house you've lived in your entire life and it's a big house it's a mansion and there's many many rooms that you didn't even know exist hidden rooms behind the bookshelves under the floorboards rooms that you had no idea were there and some of them are fantastic and some of them are terrifying basements and ayahuasca takes you on a journey through that at at its at its at its most effective you sit in front of the shaman with the candlelight with the sounds of the jungle and you drink the substance and after that what happens is the journey is all inside and and the the shaman's supposed to be able to guide you through that but in my experience you're you're so deep inside like falling through nebulas out in space no physical form or crawling through the jungle like it's like you it's really really powerful like it's not like a it's not like the recreational drugs that that that everyone does like where you go oh i did mushrooms and i could see so i could see music like and i was talking to my friends but no no no no like you're face down on the floor usually vomiting sometimes shitting you know having dialogues with with the creator and that that that can be that can be traumatizing as well as amazing it's a really good way of looking at it as a big house and you get to open doors that you've never have before and discover what rooms are there inside you you ever think about that like that there's parts of yourself you haven't discovered yet or maybe you've been suppressing how much are you exploring the shadow oh boy so say you me carl jung and jordan peterson are in a deserted island together fuck i didn't even make my bed today there's no bed in an island great it's a campsite i wanna see you and jordan peterson do ayahuasca together i i think i think that's that's the thing ayahuasca to me you know i've i've kinda told you about like i've i've experienced some things that really made me believe that that there's that there's a benevolent force around us but to me ayahuasca was like a was a ride through the scariest parts of the universe to sort of be like here's here's what it could be like you know the that's where i came up with my idea that you know like deep space or just space outer space is just the outside of the video game and this is it because when i was on ayahuasca i was i was one of the jungle creatures and i wasn't paul and i didn't have a name and for a long time i saw many things and i was i arrived at this spot in the jungle where there was a big tree and all the animals were there and they were all not in words not in and not in any language that we can understand but they were all discussing what to do about the threat and and it was all it was all leaving it was all flying up and it was fire and the jungle was being destroyed and it was like and then after that it was just space and stars and silence like crushing vacuum silence for years and that was terrifying that was fucking terrifying when i came back and i had hands man i can remember my own name you're grounded things are simpler you're back inside the video game what are the chances you think we're actually living in a video game when you say a video game it implies that there's a player who's the player is god no there's a main player usually that's not gonna be god god is the thing that creates the video game oh so then we're just and there's somebody who's our npcs like i'm an npc you're an npc jesus christ i'm a main character you yeah yeah you created me is this like halo where you can kinda kill the npcs because i see how you put the machete behind you okay i i think i'm just gonna take a stand here i think that because people i'm just i'm just sick of fucking playing it halfway i think that because people live indoors in climate controlled boxes in cities far away from nature they've completely lost track of everything that's real and they've started to think that we're living inside of a simulation notice that nobody carrying an alpaca up a mountain thinks that we're living inside of a video game they all know that it's real because they've had babies on the floor of a cold hut yeah they understand the consequences of life they understand the fish and how hard it is to get them and the basic rules of the wind and the rain and the river and that we all have to play by those and that it's and and you talk to a talk to a grieving mother and ask her if she's living inside a video game and it's like the people to me this this whole thing of oh are we living in a simulation to me that's that's that's the that's the infirmary of of society starting to that to starting to to to to to to parody itself it's it's people going i have no meaning in my life anymore so is this even real and again go ask the sherpa go ask the eskimo they're they're not they're not worried about it what fundamentally matters in life what is the source of meaning in a human life if you talk about such subjects nevertheless you could for a time stroll in the big philosophical questions and if you do it for short enough of time you won't forget about the things that matter that there is human suffering that there is real human joy that is real that that that that that our time in the jungle was very hard did you suffer enough to know that it's real yeah i man i was hoping we're in a video game that whole time so that's actually that's actually a really good way to there was this moment that i watched where you were washing a shirt in this pathetic puddle because we had no water and because we had walked all day and tripped all day and gotten thorns in our hands and our feet and our legs and we were lost in the jungle and it was nighttime and we didn't know if a big tree was gonna just fall on us and mouse trap kill us and there's a lot of uncertainty but i watched something very special happen to you and that was i saw you crouching by the side of this puddle it wasn't even a flowing stream so we couldn't drink it and you were just trying to wash the sweat off of your shirt and you you looked at me and you just said the only thing that i care about right now is water mhmm and i feel like in that moment we were united in the in the simple reality of the fact that we were so thirsty that it hurt mhmm and that it was a little scary yeah it was scary but also there's like a joy in the interaction with the water because it cools your body temperature down and there's like a faith in that interaction that eventually we'll find clean water because water's plentiful on earth it's kinda like a delusional faith that eventually we'll find it was just like a little celebration i think the cooling aspect of the water because you know the body temperature is really high from traversing the really dense jungle and just the cooling was somehow grounding in a way that nothing else really is yeah it was a little celebration of life of life on earth of earth of the jungle of everything it was a nice it was a nice moment i think about that had a couple of those there's one in the puddle and one in the river one was full of delusion and fear and the other one was full of relief and celebration yeah i've i've you know there's this thing that they they say where the the the all the pleasure in life is derived from the transitions when you're cold warm feels good when you're hot cold feels good when you're hungry food feels good and when you're that thirsty water becomes god mhmm and it's all you want and also and also the other thing is that when you're when we're out there it felt so good to be so lost and so tired and so like we were doing level like like how would you how would you describe the physicality of what we were doing the level of physical like exertion well it's something that i've haven't trained i don't even know how you would train for that kind of thing but it's extremely dense jungle so every single step is like completely unpredictable in terms of the terrain your foot interacts with so the different variety of slippery that is on the jungle floor is fascinating because some things i mean the slope matters but some roots of trees are slippery some are not some trees in the ground already routed through so if you step through you're going to potentially fall through so it could be a shallow hole or it could be a very deep hole with some leaves and vegetation covering up a hole where if you fall through you could break a leg and completely lose your footing or fall rolling downhill and if you roll downhill i'm i'm pretty sure there's a ninety nine percent probability that you'll hit a thing with spikes on it so there's so many layers of avoiding dangers of small dangers and big dangers all around you with every single step so there's like a mental exhaustion that sets in like just the perception and you're just observing you you're extremely good at perceiving having situational awareness of taking the information in that's really important and filtering out the stuff that's not important but even for you that's exhausting and for me it was completely exhausting just paying attention paying attention to everything around you so that exhaustion was surprising because it's like there there's moments when you're like i don't give a damn anymore i'm just gonna step i'm just going to like and so that's it you go i don't care anymore and you reach out and you know i'm just gonna lean against this tree and then what happened and then you just spikes in it yeah yeah and then you have to care yeah and then there's just bad luck because there is wasp nest there there is there's just like a million things and that is physically is mentally psychologically exhausting because there's the uncertainty when is this gonna end it's up in our particular situation up and down hills up and down hills very steep downward very steep upward no water all this kind of stuff it's the most difficult thing i've ever done but it's very difficult to describe what are the parameters that make it difficult because i i run long distances very regularly i do extremely difficult physical things regularly that on some surface level could seem much more challenging than what we did but no this was another beast this is something else but it was also raw and real and beautiful because it's like it's what the explorers did yeah it's what earth is without humans and and also just like the massive scale of the trees around us was the humbling size difference between human and tree it's both humbling in that like that tree is really old it's a it's a time difference lifetime difference and just the scale it's like holy shit we live on an earth that can create those things it makes me feel small in every way that life is short that my physical presence on this earth is tiny how vulnerable i am all of those feelings are there and in that the physical endurance of traversing the jungle yeah was the the hardest journey that i remember ever taking every step and then that made making it out of the jungle and then made it the swim and the water that we could drink that was just pure joy it was probably one of the happiest moments in my life just sitting there with you paul and with jj in the water full darkness the rain coming down and all just us all just laughing having made it through that having eaten a bit of food before and the absurdity of the timing of all of it that it somehow worked out and how were just three little humans sitting in a river just our heads emerged barely above water with jungle all around us what a life that was a real adventure that was a real adventure that was a real one yeah i'll never forget that so it's a real honor to have shared that of course we had very different experiences when you saw i came in in that situation you're like i have to go meet that guy it's a friend of mine i mean we were in the in the river in a thunderstorm just next above we're all laughing our asses off and i mean we're in the river with the stingrays and the black caiman and the piranha and all the electric eels and everything and it's pitch black out and then what were we doing we're holding our headlamps up and there was those swirling moths yeah the infinity moths all making those geometric patterns and it's like we're just three ridiculous primates mhmm three friends in a river just laughing yeah because we were safer in that river than we had been in there and we were rejoicing yeah that that that the thunderstorm was was compared to the war zone that we'd been living in the thunderstorm was safe and it was it really was a beautiful moment and also that like very different life trajectories have taken these three humans into this one place yeah it's like what yeah wow yeah universe that would like because we're kinda like those moths you know what i mean like we're we're we'd we'd come from some weird place on this earth and we'd have all kinds of shit happen to us and we're all pursuing some shit and some light and we ended up here together enjoying this moment yeah that's something else it just felt absurd and in that absurdity was just like real human joy and damn water tasted good water's good man water and those those little oranges yeah yeah yeah those things and then i would just say like do you feel like i feel like running like no matter how much i run i feel like the like you run you do a workout and then you stop mhmm like maybe all people who do ultras feel this but like i felt like the we would we woke up it was like you know wake up at dawn six am let's start walking mhmm you know break camp go and it's like pretty much you just don't stop all day mhmm and it's level ten cardio all day long and you're sweating buckets and there's no water it's like you would never put yourself through that voluntarily mhmm you couldn't you'd never you would never have the resolve to to continue torturing yourself except for that we were trying to make it to the to freedom mhmm to get out and it's like the the obsession of that with the compass and the machete and the navigating fuck i think there's something to be said about like the fact that we didn't think through much of that no and we just dived into it i think there was like there were like laughing enjoying ourselves moments before and once you go in you're like oh shit oh shit and you just come face to face with it yeah i i think that's what you know whatever that is in humans that goes to that that's what the explorers do the you know and the the best of them do it to the extreme levels well i think that what we did was to to a pretty extreme level because we we left the safety of a river of knowing where we were and voluntarily got lost in the amazon with very little provisions on an on a very now that we're back now that we experience what we experience i really can't stop thinking about how fucking stupid it was that we did that yeah because if we had gotten lost pico was saying to me even if you guys had if one of you had broken your leg mhmm it's you know days in either direction even if they had sent help for us help would take how long to to scour all that jungle sound doesn't travel even even a helicopter even if they looked for us they wouldn't be able to see us how would we signal for help can't really build a fire and so it's like if anything had gone wrong if we'd gone a few degrees different different to the west would have taken us two more days mhmm if we'd if we'd gotten injured it'd be it'd be carried through that yeah and so it somehow only afterwards am i really going wow thank god we got out of this thank god after i see so many people going make sure nothing happens to lex fridman yeah i'd be the deadest motherfucker on earth if i don't know it somehow works out it does seem to somehow work out let me ask you about jane goodall another explorer of a different kind what do you think about her about her role in understanding this natural world of ours i think that jane is like a living historical treasure like i think somehow she's alive but she's she's already reached that level where it's like einstein jane goodall like there's these these these incredible minds and you know growing up as a child my parents would read to me because i was so dyslexic i didn't learn to read until i was quite old and my mom was a big jane goodall fan and and all i wanted to hear about was animals and so i would i would get read to about this lady named jane goodall this girl who went to africa she became this incredible advocate for earth and for ecosystems and for and she seemed to realize as her career went on that that teaching children to appreciate nature was the key because they're going you know with that thing where she says we don't so much inherit the earth from our ancestors but borrow it from our children we're just here we're just passing through and so if we destroy it we're we're we're we're we're dimming the lights on the lives of future generations and so she's been really really cognizant of that and she's been a light in the darkness she's sort of in terms of saying that animals have personalities and culture and and their own inalienable rights and reasons for existing and and that human life is valuable she's very big on that every day we influence the people around us and and the events of the earth even if you feel like your life is small and insignificant that that that you do have an impact and i think that's a really powerful little candle out there in the darkness that jane carries what do you think about her fieldwork with the chimps badass the fact that she did what she did at the age that she did yeah at the time that she did yeah is is incredible it's actually incredible she has that explorer gene and she also has that relentless relentlessness is like th this incredible quality she just you know she travels three hundred days a year educating people talking around the world trying to help bolster conservation now before it's too late mhmm and traveling three hundred days a year is not fun traveling at all is gonna be not fun so i i started reading the river of doubt book you recommended to me on teddy roosevelt yeah so that guy is badass on many levels but i didn't realize how much of a naturalist he was how much of a scholar of the natural world he was so that book details his journey into the amazon jungle what do you find inspiring about teddy roosevelt and that whole journey of just saying fuck it of going to the amazon jungle of taking on that expedition well i mean teddy roosevelt you could write volumes on what's inspiring about him i think that you know he was he was a weak asthmatic little rich kid that that wasn't physically able that had no self confidence and he was very and he and and he had pretty severe depression he had tragedy in his life and he was very at least for me he's been one of the people like in the one of the first historical figures who where where he wrote about the struggle to overcome those things and and to make himself from being a weak asthmatic little teenager to to to sort of strengthening himself and building muscle becoming this barrel chested lion of a guy who could be the president who could be an explorer and one of the rough riders and he's just everything he does is so is so hyperbolically you know incredible to come out of war and have the other people you fought with go he this guy has no fear i mean he must have just been a psychopath and had no fear and then proving it further was that thing where he was gonna give a speech to a bunch of people and he got shot in the chest yeah and went through his spectacle case and through his speech and even though the bullet was lodged in his chest this man said don't hurt the guy that shot me i believe he asked him why'd you do it and then as he's bleeding and in the rain said no no no i'm not going to the hospital i'm gonna keep going with the speech what a badass that's incredible but going to the jungle on many levels is really is really difficult for him at that time there's so many things that so many more things even than now that can kill you all the different infections everything and the and the lack of knowledge just the the sheer lack of knowledge so that truly is an expedition a really really challenging expedition so there's lessons about what it takes to be a great explorer from that the perseverance how important do you think is perseverance in exploration especially through the jungle i think it's all there is if you hear about the people and and and i think that that is a tremendous metaphor for life because whether you hear about that plane that crashed in the andes and the people were alone and freezing and they had to eat each other and some of them made it out some of them kept the fire burning and teddy roosevelt voluntarily after being president threw himself into the amazon rainforest and survived came so close to dying but survived and so perseverance is all of it i mean that's that's i think that's our quality as a human so they also mapped so on the biology side it's interesting yeah but they they mapped and documented a lot of the unknown geography and biodiversity what what does it take to do that so when i when i see you move about the jungle you're always like you capture and increase you take a picture write down like so you can find new creatures find new things about the jungle document them sort of a scientific perspective on the jungle but back then there was even less known much less known about the jungle so what what do you think it takes to document to map that world and you on explored wilderness i i mean they're they're clearly pressing botanical specimens they're probably shooting birds and and and roosevelt knew how to knew how to preserve those specimens i mean he really was a naturalist so he knew exact so if he's seeing these animals to them where whereas we'll take a picture and identify it they were harvesting specimens taking them with them drying them out for them it was totally different and and it could be the first you know there's i don't know i forget what jj said there's something like seventy species of antbirds here and it's like so how likely are you to be the first person to ever see this one species of bird and so for them as you have this bird and so perfectly preserving that specimen i think a lot of nonscientific people don't realize that every species from blue whale to elephant to blue jay to sparrow whatever whatever it is whatever species we have on record they're scientific specimens and the first people to see them shot them mhmm and that's the museums are filled with these catalogs preserved birds that these explorers brought back from new guinea and south america and africa and then put into these drawers and and and now we we labeled them and we said this is you know yeah this is red and green macaw this is scarlet macaw this is brown crested ant bird and this is and it's just they're just categorized that book of birds you have like encyclopedia of birds yo what the human achievement in these pages for people listening paul just flipping through a huge number of pages these are just is this in the amazon or is this in peru this is just here the birds of peru it dude pages on pages of toucans and arasari's and and hummingbirds and antbirds and and smokey brown woodpecker and and tropical screech owl which we just heard by the way mhmm it's just it's endless mhmm who knew there were so many birds i had no idea there were so many birds documenting all of that analyze i mean there's also which we got to experience and you're you're you're pretty good at also is is actually making understanding and making the sounds of the different birds yeah what's your favorite bird sound to make undulated tinamu because in the crepuscular hours of dawn and dusk they're usually the ones that make up what is considered by many to be the anthem of the amazon can you do a a little bird for us that's what a undulated sounds like and it's usually like oh it is getting to be afternoon it's kinda it's almost like hearing church bells on a sunday it's like you just there's something about it you go ah there he is and like you were saying it's a reminder oh that's a friend of mine yeah surrounded by friends i have so many friends here what does it take to survive out here what is the basic principles of survival in the jungle cleanliness i mean really but we talked about this but like you know keeping i have so many holes in my skin right now look i have a mosquito there we go i have so many spots that i've scratched off of my skin because a mosquito bites me and then i scratch it or the other big one is that i i i worry that i have a tick mhmm not deliberately not with my thinking brain but my my my simian brain just wants to find and remove ticks and so i scratch and then if my fingernails get too long i remove my skin and then those beget those get infected in the jungle mhmm so staying hyper clean using soap mhmm like basic stuff keeping order to your bags order to your gear things in dry bags make sure you know we did we we explained that we got in the river during a thunderstorm we didn't explain why we did that because the thunderstorm came when we had eaten dinner but we hadn't set up our tents mhmm and so we decided to cover our bags with our boats that we had been carrying our pack rafts that we'd been carrying in our backpacks so all of our gear would stay dry mhmm so the only thing we could do is either sit in the rain and be cold or sit in the river and be warm mhmm and so keeping our gear dry momentary discomfort for future you know that would that that to me was an incredibly smart calculation to make because you really just you gotta be smart out here you can't you know not running out of a headlamp while you're out on the trail and being stuck in that darkness yeah it really takes just being a little bit on your toes and i find that that that necessity of being on your toes is a is a place that i like to live in it's just the right amount of challenge here so so keeping the gear organized and all that but also being willing to sort of improvise i've seen you improvise very well because there's so much unknowns there's so many so much chaos and dynamic aspects that like planning is not going to prevent you from having to face that in the end of the day no it's been really funny watching you sort of shed your planning brain like day like day one it was very much like so are we gonna and then i i could tell i could see your i could see your brow sort of furrow when you i would go i don't know what time we're gonna get get there and you'd go well well just tell me and i'd be like i i don't know what the jungle's gonna let us do you know let's do let's record the podcast tomorrow okay but we if it if it you know if it rains if it gets windy if a friaje comes if there's a a jaguar with rabies like anything could happen landslides like anything literally tree i mean the thing you mentioned trees falling that's a thing in the jungle that's a major thing in the jungle holy shit first of all a lot of trees fall yeah and they fall quickly and they could just kill you they fall quickly they're huge we're talking about trees that are like the size of school buses stacked yeah and connected to other trees with vines so that when they fall this millennium tree this thousand year old tree boom it shakes the ground pulls down other trees with it so if you're anywhere near that for a few acres you're getting smashed mhmm that's the end of you and so the jungle at any moment that you're out there could just decide to delete you and then the leafcutter ants and the army ants and the flies and everything you'll be digested in three days you'll be gone gone no bones nothing who do you think would eat most of you i would hope that that like a king vulture with a colorful face would just like just get in there like right in the heart just like nature's metal just like when they like walk in through the elephant's ass i'd i'd want that on camera trap i think that would be a great way to go and we slowly look up and just kinda smile yeah just rip out your intestines and just shake it yeah just victorious over your dead body well but also honor a friend that's another yeah sure but you know you just you'd look so you know your white naked ass laying there in the jungle you'd be like face down shit that's why you always have to look good any any moment of a tree can fall on you and a vulture just swoops in and eats your heart that's right we talked about alone this show a bit yo rock house yeah who is what do you think about that guy rock house roland welker from season seven he built the rock house he killed the muskox with bow and arrow and finished it with a knife and had the gopro to mount it you know yeah to to document it that's really mind blowing i mean so for people who don't know that show is you're supposed to survive as long as possible on season seven of the show they literally said you can only win it if you survive a hundred days and and that's there's a lot of aspects of that show that's difficult one of which is it's in the cold the others they get just a handful of supplies no food nothing none of that so they have to figure all of that out and this is probably one of the greatest performers on the show roland welker he built a rock house shelter so what i mean what does survival entail it's building a shelter fire catching food so staying warm getting enough energy to sort of keep doing the work it takes a lot of work like building the rock house i read that it took five hundred calories an hour from him so he had to feed himself right quite a lot you're lifting two hundred pound boulders and still the guy lost i read forty four pounds which is twenty percent of his body weight so that's survival what lessons what inspiration do you draw from him i think he was fun to watch because he had this indomitable spirit mhmm he was just he wasn't there to commune with nature he was there to win and he was like to me that's the pioneer mentality he just he was just he goes i'm a hunting guide i'm out here i'm gonna win that money i'm gonna survive through the winter he wasn't worried i feel like so many people are like they worry second guessing themselves am i in a video game i don't know what's my you know just questioning their entire existential identity and this guy was like you know what there's a musk ox over there mhmm i'm gonna shoot it i'm gonna stab it and then i'm gonna make a pouch out of its ball sack and i'm gonna live off that for the next few months and win a half million dollars and that's an amazing amount of pragmatic optimism that i just enjoyed and every time he would go we gotta get back to rock house and it became yeah even though he's all alone it was he had a big smile on his face and what made that season so great was that it was him and then it was cali mhmm and and roland had you know the muscle and could make rock house and then callie was was the opposite she was this girl who yeah she could hunt with her bow and she knew how to fish and and she wasn't using raw power but what was so endearing about her was that how much she loved being out there as hard as it was and as isolation isolationist as it was she was smiling every time every time the show cut to her she was like hey everybody mhmm it's morning can you believe the frost like you've been out there for a hundred days amazing i think it was really an amazing show of that that the game is all here the game of life mhmm the game of alone and the game of life because it's the same thing yeah she maintained that sort of silliness the the goofiness all through it when the condition got really tough and she had a very different perspective as you know roland didn't want any of the spirituality it's very pragmatic yeah and for cali's very spiritual collection connection to the land she said something like she wanted not only to take from the land but to give back i mean there's this kinda poetic spiritual connection to the land it's such a dire contrast to roland and but she's still a badass i mean to survive no matter what no matter the kind of personality you have you have to be a badass i think she took a porcupine quill from her shoulder that was crazy because it i think it went in yeah somewhere completely different and it migrated to her shoulder yeah and the way that i understood that is because they have i said that's impossible yeah because i remember that she's like pulling off her shirt and she she's like there's something and then she like pushes it out yeah and i remember like i was like hold up hold up hold up hold up how yeah yeah and it was because the barbs once it goes in as you move and flex your body it moves a little bit each time and it gets to migrate like i didn't even think of that shit plus if i remember correctly i think she caught two porcupines the second one was like rotting or something or if it infected it had an infected body whatever had the spots on it yeah she chose not to eat it no and then she chose not to eat it at first and then she decided to eat it eventually yeah i forgot that yeah and she that was that was an insane sort of really thoughtful focused collected decision waiting a day and then saying fuck it i need i need this fat and that was the other thing is like fat is important oh yeah it's like meat is not enough you learn about like what are the different food sources there apparently there's like rabbit starvation is a thing because when you have too much lean meat it doesn't nourish the body fat is the thing that nourishes the body especially in cold conditions so that's the thing she yeah she she was she was incredible and i thought as as as as brash and sort of fun as roland was she represented a a much more beautiful take on on it and it was really heartbreaking when she lost because i mean and like you said still a badass yeah it's kinda like forrest griffin versus stefan stefan bonner like it was like it doesn't matter who won yeah you guys beat the shit out of each other like and she didn't really lose right so she she got evaced yeah because her toe was going frostbite frostbite a hundred days you think you can do a hundred days honestly i've done a i've i've eighteen years in the amazon man i just at this point it's i could i wouldn't sign up for another hundred days yeah you know at this point i don't i don't have that to prove i've survived in the wild and i wouldn't wanna voluntarily take a hundred days away from everyone i know yeah the loneliness aspect is is tough we're not meant for that i really love the people i have in my life and i i wouldn't i wouldn't and you see it on the show a lot of the people yeah big tough ex navy seals who are survival experts who know what they're doing they get out there and they go you know what i miss my family yeah and they go it's not worth it they have this existential realization they go we only got i only got so many years here like let's let's this is crazy it's just some money fuck it and they go home you know it's funny because you sometimes feeling yourself in the jungle when you're alone mhmm and there's another guy jordan jonas hobo joro he's the season six winner and he said that the camera made him feel less lonely i i've heard of him from multiple channels one of the things is he spent all of his twenties in living in siberia with the with the tribes out there herzog happy people and so he actually talked about that it's one of the loneliest time of his life because when he went up there he didn't speak russian and he needed to learn the language and even though you have people around you when you don't speak their language it feels really really lonely and he felt less lonely on the show because he had the camera and he felt like he could talk to the camera there there is an element when you have in these harsh conditions if you like record something you feel like you're talking to another human through it even if it's just a recording i sometimes feel that like maybe because i imagine a specific person that will watch it and i feel like i'm talking to that person well i noticed that when things got especially hard and they did get especially hard when we were out in the wilderness that you would begin filming to share that struggle but i also think that i've used that at times where yeah you go well maybe if i because if you can tell someone else about it then you're on the hero's journey mhmm and and then it sorta has to make you braver and it changes how you because you go i'm i'm cold and i'm tired and i'm i'm hungry and this hurts and that hurts and i don't know when we're gonna make it and how is this gonna go and and all of a sudden you go well guys we're we're here and we're going that way and and and then you're like well i gotta keep going because because you're like they're they're still out there if you forget you have to step up that's one of the reasons i i want a family i think when you have kids yeah you have to be like you have to be the best version of yourself like for them all my friends with kids that i've seen them go through where until you have a family you're just you're just playing around man i mean you could do important work you can you can have skin in the in other games but it's once you have a little tribe of humans that depends on you yeah if you take that seriously if you wanna do that right it's one of the hardest things you could do and it it just it just changes everything how has your life changed since we last met speak about changing everything so you've been for people who don't know pushing jungle keepers forward into uncharted territories saving more and more and more and more rainforest stories to be told there it's a fight it's a battle it's a battle to protect this this beautiful it's a battle to protect this this beautiful area of rainforest of nature but since we last met you've made you've continued to make a lot of progress so what what's what's the story of jungle keepers leading up to the moment we met and after and everything you're going doing right now eighteen years ago when i first came to the jungle i was a kid from new york who always dreamed since i was six years old maybe even younger of going to a place where animals were everywhere and there's big trees and skyscrapers of life and so being dyslexic and and not fitting in in school and and reading about jane goodall and having lord of the rings be one of the things i grew up on i just chose to come to the amazon and the first person i met was this local indigenous conservationist named juan julio duran who was trying to protect this remote river the las piedras river mhmm which in history apparently fawcett referenced either the las piedras but he called it tawomanu and said don't go there you'll surely die from tribes and so there's very few references to this this river in history it stayed very wild because it's been a place that the law hasn't made it that the government hasn't really extended to like you know we're sort of past the police limit and so jj was out here ages ago trying to protect this river before it was too late and when i met him i was just a barely out of high school kid with a dream of see just seeing the rainforest let alone seeing a giant anaconda or having any sort of meaningful experience or contribution to the narrative and somehow over all the years that we began working together and sparked a friendship and began exploring and going on expeditions and bringing people to the rainforest and and asking them for help and manifesting the hell out of this insane dream that we had i mean we didn't even have a boat we would take logs down the river we would have to cut a tree down every time we wanted to return to civilization we'd have to cut down a balsa tree and float down the river float down the river on it yeah it was it was it's madness like it's madness it's pure madness and i don't know what made us keep going but along the way people showed up who cared and who wanted to help and if it was a movie it wouldn't even necessarily be a good movie because you'd go oh please you're just telling me that you just kept doing the thing and just magically people showed up but yeah that's what happened that's exactly the way it went we kept doing the thing that we loved we said it doesn't matter if we don't have funding or a boat or gasoline or friends or or anything we just kept going mhmm and along the way we found someone who could help us start a ranger program and then we found dax da silva who helped us fund the beginning of jungle keepers and then people like mohsen and stefan who were there making sure that this thing actually took flight off the ground and then right around the time that we were wondering what was gonna happen and if we're all gonna have to quit and get real jobs and if we could actually save the rainforest from the destruction that was coming lex fridman sends me a dm mhmm and honestly changed the entire narrative because up until then we had been we had been playing in the minor leagues pretending trying real real hard and the listeners of your show in the moments after you published your episode with with our conversation began showing up in droves and supporting jungle keepers putting in five ten a hundred a thousand we started getting these donations and the incredible team that i work with we all went into hyperdrive everybody everybody started going nuts we all started spending sixteen hour days working to try and deal with the tidal wave that lex sent towards us just because so many people knew that we were doing this that was an indigenous led fight to protect this incredibly ancient virgin rainforest before it was cut and people resonated with that and so we we we got this this this huge swell of support and this year we've we've protected thousands and thousands of more acres of rainforest because of that swell of support so current fifty thousand acres what's the goal what's the approach to saving this rainforest since we printed this it's gone up to sixty six thousand acres it's and and as you know in each of those little acres are millions and millions of animal heartbeats and societies of animals and the goal here is that we're between manu national park alto puros national park the tampa potter reserve we're in a region that's known as the biodiversity capital of peru one of the most biodiverse parts of the western amazon and we're fighting along the edge of the trans amazon highway and so it's it's just a small group of local people and some international experts who have come together and used these incredibly out of side of the box strategies to sort of crowdfund conservation to go look we know that this incredible life is here we have the scientific evidence we have the national park system if we can protect this before they cut it down mhmm we could do something of global significance all these jaguars all these monkeys all these undescribed medicines the uncontacted tribes that we share this forest with could all be protected and people have stepped up and begun to make that happen and there's people from all over the world and it's incredible but what's the approach so trying to with donations to buy out more and more of the land and then protect it so the approach is that currently the government favors extractors so if you're a a gold miner or a log an illegal logger or you just wanna cut down and burn a bunch of rainforests and set up a cacao farm the government's fine with that doesn't matter you're not really breaking the law if you destroy nature so so as long as you're producing something from the land they don't see it as a loss then then nature was destroyed permanently yeah it's just wilderness it's sort of just beyond the scope of it's not it doesn't or the local people that technically own the land out here the local indigenous people for instance we fought this year to help the community of puerto nuevo who's been fighting for twenty years to have government recognized land these are indigenous people in the amazon fighting to protect their own land and you know what it was that was holding them back they didn't understand how the the system of of of legal documents worked to certify that titled land they didn't really have the funding to go from their very very remote community into the offices and so jungle keepers helped them with that and so really all we're doing is helping local people protect the forest that is their world that's it if people donate how will that help if people donate to jungle keepers what what you're doing is you're helping someone like jj who's an indigenous naturalist who has the vision who has seen forest be destroyed he's trying to protect it before it's too late you're saving mahogany trees ironwood trees kapok trees skyscrapers of life just monkeys birds reptiles amphibians birds mammals this entire avatar on earth world of rainforest that produces a fifth of the oxygen we breathe and the water we drink this incredible thing as far as i know it's the most direct way to protect that and so the fact that the fact that we've you know we have large funders who give us you know a hundred thousand dollars to protect this huge swath of land and that goes through through things like this and through instagram it you know it goes directly to the local conservationists who who work with the loggers to protect that land before it's cut but one of the most impactful things that has happened this year in the wake of our last conversation was that i got an email from a mother and she said you know i'm a single mom and i work a few jobs and i can't afford to give you a ton of money but me and my kids look at your instagram often after dinner and they really wanna protect the heartbeats they really wanna protect the animals in the rainforest and so we do we give five dollars a month to jungle keepers and it was to me that was so impactful because i used to be that little kid worried about the animals and i saw how a few million raindrops can create a flood yeah i ask that people donate to jungle keepers you guys are legit that money is going to go a long way jungle keepers dot org if you somehow were able to raise very large so the the raindrops would make a waterfall a very large amount of money i don't know what that number is maybe ten million dollars twenty million thirty million what are the different milestones along the way that could really help help you on the journey of saving the rainforest if we did if let's just say some company organization or or if enough people donated it let's just say we got that thirty million that money would go directly into stopping logging roads mhmm into creating a corridor a biological corridor that connects the uncontacted indigenous reserves with other tribal lands with manu national park with the tempo pata which establishes essentially the largest protected area in the amazon rainforest and what makes this groundbreaking is that we're not doing this in the traditional way we're doing this take it to the people mhmm and that's what's been so exciting is that you know when he started this when jj started this thirty years ago he had no idea his father wanted him to be a logger he didn't have shoes until he was thirteen years old he grew up bathing in the river he had no idea that a bunch of crazy foreigner scientists were gonna show up and some guy in a james bond suit was gonna come down here with microphones and and that all of a sudden the world would know that he was on this quest to protect this this incredible ecosystem and all those little aliens well that's the only important thing to remember that the the people that are cutting down the forest the loggers are also human beings they have families they're they're they're basically trying to survive and they're desperate and they're doing the thing that will bring them money and so they're just human beings at the core of it if they have other option if they have other options they will probably choose to give their life to saving the community to first and foremost providing for their family and after that saving the community helping the community flourish and i think probably a lot of them love the rainforest they grew up in the rainforest yeah i mean look at pico yeah pico used to be a logger full time logger long time logger now he loves conservation he goes you're soi muy conservationista he's like yeah you know it's it's all about just providing people people options there's some dark stuff on the oh on the gold mine stuff you've talked about you showed me parts of the rainforest where the gold mines are and and they're just kind of erasing the rainforest yeah so at the edges that's when the mining happens and it's this ugly it's this ugly process of they're just destroying the jungle just for the surface layer of the sand or whatever that they process to to collect just little bits of gold and there's also very dark things that happen along the way as the communities around the gold mines are created so the entirety of the moral system that emerges from that has things like prostitution where one third of the women that are drawn into that sex traffic and prostitution are minors under you know under seventeen years old thirteen to seventeen year old there's just a lot of really really dark stuff i think that we have a rare chance to do something against that darkness i think that this is an example of local people who have taken action done good work been good to the people that have visited harnessed a certain amount of international momentum and now we're on the cusp of doing something historic and so for the children in the communities along this river it won't be being a prostitute in a gold mine it'll be becoming a trained ranger like last month our ranger coordinator and one of our one of our female rangers went to africa for a ranger conference and it's like we're beginning to this is someone from a little tiny village mhmm with thatched huts upriver she went to africa to talk about being a professional conservation ranger and it's like that's that's changing lives and her her daughters then she's married to ignacio the guy mhmm she like her her their kids are gonna grow up seeing their parents walking around with the emblem on and go oh i wanna and then and then people like pico and pedro and all these guys that work here are gonna go well we have to we have to protect this forest mhmm and then they start getting fascinated about the snakes mhmm and then they start caring about the turtle eggs and then all of a sudden they have a way of life and and nobody needs to go be nobody can nobody needs to go steal anybody's kids to be a prostitute in a gold mine that's horrible and so it's really a it's a win win for the for the animals for the river for the rainforest for people who are improve it's biocentric conservation it's it's just making everything better yeah i've read in an article that said an estimated twelve hundred girls between ages of twelve and seventeen are forcibly drafted into child prostitution around the communities in the gold mines at least one third of the prostitutes in the camp are underage the girls had ended up in the camp after receiving a tip that there were restaurants looking for waitresses and willing to pay top dollar they jumped on and bused together and came down to the rainforest what they found was not what they were expecting the mining camp restaurant served food for only a few hours a day the rest of the time it was the girls themselves who were on the menu literally at the end of the road and without the money to return home the girls would soon become trapped in prostitution it's interesting to me that the most devastating destruction of nature the complete erasure of the rainforest burned to the ground sucked through a hose spit out into a disgusting mercury puddle like the complete annihilation of life on earth goes hand in hand with the complete annihilation of a young life it's like it's all based around the same thing it's it's the light versus the dark that's that's it's it's the destruction and the chaos versus a move towards order and hope and and and it is incredibly dark and this region is heavy with it well i'm glad you're fighting for the light is there like a milestone in the near future that you're working towards like financially in terms of donations there is in in the next year and a half as you saw in your time here there's there's roads working around the jungle keeper's concessions all the work that the local people are doing to protect this land is trying to be dismantled by international corporations that are subcontracting logging companies here and really what we need is thirty million dollars in the next two years to protect the whole thing you've seen the ancient mahogany trees you've seen the families of monkeys you've seen the caiman in the river all of this is standing in the pathway of destruction that road they're gonna come down that road and men with chainsaws are going to dismantle a forest that has been growing since the beginning this is so magical do you see the snake over there yep do you that is a snake i'm just gonna don't move i don't want you to move i'm gonna just this is one of the most beautiful snakes in the amazon rainforest this is the blunt headed tree snake you're my favorite snakes i've been hoping that you would get to see this snake i have been praying oh boy okay okay let's just let's just let's just go right back into this look at this little beauty creation let's keep you away from the fire look at this little blunt headed tree snake wow such an incredible so tell me about the snake harmless little snake if you put your hand out it'll probably just crawl onto your hand just be real careful with the fire so look i'm just gonna put him like this and we're gonna yeah let's just snake safety so he's a tree snake yep nice and slow nice and slow nice and slow so you nice and slow just really slow just be the tree be the tree that he climbs on and this is like again this is a snake that's so thin and so small there you go there you go nice and slow just just be the tree let him crawl around so he's going to try and do all this stuff let me see if i can just calm him down for a sec let me just see he's very active little snake so see like the snake the other night okay just come look at this i can see the light through his body to me this is an alien mhmm this is this strange little life form his eyes are two thirds of his head i'm not joking you look at their skull he's so tiny he's so tiny for people listening there's a snake in paul's hands right now and it's very it's long of course but very skinny very very light and and the also for everyone listening the odds of that as we're sitting here doing this podcast that a snake would just be crawling by in the jungle might sound like something that would happen but the density of snakes in the amazon rainforest makes this a very unique experience can you tell me a little bit about the coloration scheme yeah so a little bit brown yeah just to describe this as we're as we were talking here it's just a sort of banded white and brown snake with this tiny little head about the size of my pinky nail two thirds of this snake's head is made up of its gigantic eyes it's got a small mouth and it's it's about about a third as thick as a pencil it's basically a moving shoestring it's incredibly incredibly thin the only thing i am thinking lexo is that if we have dan come and just do some shots of yeah that's true dan so what what are we looking at the snake that was crawling behind us in the jungle that i we we were talking about jungle keepers and what we could do and the snake just showed up at that moment and this is a very active little snake who's out for a hunt tonight and wants to find something to eat so this is a blunt headed tree snake totally harmless little literally a moving shoestring mhmm super beautiful little animal when you talk about aliens to me this is this is an alien like what are you thinking what are you doing right now what do you think about the fact that we are handled being handled by these giant humans and as you were saying it reaches up to the leaves yeah this snake just naturally knows to go look you just put them anywhere near leaves and he's like i got this he just wants to go right up into that tree i just want you to try holding him and real gentle just be the tree yeah and just just kinda do the same thing you learned last night just nice and gentle yep and see he's holding on to my finger right now he's just going up there you go perfect nice and easy he's a little erratic he's a little goofy maybe he's camera shy maybe a fan of the podcast and gigantic eyes relative to his body size huge oh jeez hello moth traffic traffic in the jungle and then for everyone listening as we're as we're as we're handling the snake that we found that was crawling by us like literally by our shoulders as we're talking a bat flies through no joke eight inches from lex's ear like just zips past his head as he's holding a snake while we're sitting here in the jungle it's just we're just in it now now he's gonna try and back up and how do you yeah why don't you why don't you let's encourage him to come back this way way he's he's weaved this way he's he's okay he's just he's just trying to back out yeah that i did he released oh release okay i'm gonna this is what i'm gonna do we're gonna say thank you mister snake thank you mister snake thank you mister snake go back up into the tree here we go there you go there you go there you go and then we can resume normal podcasting now because our we really are in the jungle right we really are in the jungle that's one of my favorite snakes that's one of my favorite little aliens on this planet mhmm look at that and it's going on some long journey it's gonna to the canopy carry the rest of the night so that little snake is one of the millions of life forms heartbeats that you're trying to protect exactly to me i after almost twenty years down here the people here have become my friends the the cayman on the river the the monkeys i when i fall asleep at night i think about all the different heartbeats all the different little creatures here that that when they bulldoze this forest when they when they chop down these trees that they that they vanish that we we we take away their world and in that very evolutionary historical sense of remembering the the primordial soup it's like this these this little creature is surviving out here somehow and we have the chance to save it and even if you don't care about the little creature on the pale blue dot each of these little creatures contributes to this massive orchestral hole that creates climactic stability on this planet and the amazon is one of the most important parts of that and each of these little guys is playing a role in there so one of the other fascinating life forms is other humans but living a very different kind of life so uncontacted tribes mhmm what do you find most fascinating about them what i find most fascinating about the uncontacted tribes is that while me and you are sitting here with microphones and a light somewhere out there in that darkness in that direction not so far away as the crow flies there are people sitting around a fire in the dark probably with little more than a few leaves over their heads who don't even have the use of stone tools who only have metal objects that they've stolen from nearby communities they're they're they're living such primitive isolated nomadic lives in the modern world and they're still living naked out in the jungle it's truly incredible it's truly remarkable and i think that it's because they can't advocate for themselves they can't protect themselves it's sort of like well we can let them get shot up by loggers and get their get let their land get bulldozed while they hide they have no idea that their world is being destroyed but they're they're they're sort of the scariest and most fascinating thing out there right now in the jungle what do you think their because you've spoken about them being dangerous what do you think their relationship with violence is i think why is violence part of their approach to the external world so from the best i understand it that at the turn of the century industrial revolution we had sudden immense need for rubber for hoses and gaskets and wires and tires and and the war machine and the only way to get rubber was to come down to the amazon rainforest and get the local people who knew the jungle to go out into the jungle and and cut rubber trees and collect the latex mhmm and henry ford tried doing fordlandia tried having rubber plantations but leaf blight killed it and so you had this period of horrendous extraction in the amazon where the rubber barons were coming down and just raping and pillaging the tribes and making them go out to tap these trees mhmm and the uncontacted tribe said no they had their six foot long long bows seven foot long arrows with giant bamboo tips and they moved further back into the forest and they said we will not be conquered and since that time they've been out there and it's it's confusing because in a way they're still running scared a century later and their grandparents would have told them you know the outside world everyone you see in the outside world is trying to kill you so kill them first so can you blame them for being violent no is this river still wild because loggers were scared to go here for a long time for almost a century late that's why this forest is still here yes and so is it a human rights issue that we protect the last people on earth that have no government no no affiliation no language that we can explain we don't know what their medicinal plant knowledge is we don't know their creation myths we know nothing about them and they're just out there right now with bows and arrows living in the dark surviving in the jungle naked without even spoons forget about the wheel forget about iphones they got nothing and they're making it work we don't know their creation myths so they have a very primitive existence but do you think their values first of all do you think their nature is similar to ours and how do their values differ from ours this is complicated because the the anthropologist in me wants to say that they have a a historical reason for the violent life that they have you know they experienced incredible generational trauma some time ago and that and because they've been living isolated in the jungle that has permeated to become their culture they've become a culture of violence but yet the the the contacted modern indigenous communities that we work with that are my friends that work here just the other day we were speaking to one of them who was pulling spikes out of your hand while he was explaining that he tried to help them the brothers los hermanos he tried to help them he tried to give them a gift and what did they do they shot him in the head yeah he said they're our brothers and he tried to give them bananas mhmm plantains plantains boat full of plantains mhmm and they shot at him they shot three arrows at him and one of them actually hit him in the skull and put him in the hospital and he got helicopter evacuated from his community and so he's brave for surviving but he's he's a lucky survivor they they are incredibly accurate with those bamboo tipped arrows and those arrows are seven feet long so when you get hit by one they come at a velocity that can rip through you and the range on a shotgun is way shorter than the range on a longbow you're talking about a couple hundred meters on a longbow and they're deadly accurate they can take spider monkeys out of a tree and so there's stories of loggers and i've seen the photos of the bodies of loggers who attract who attacked one of the tribes and the tribes hadn't done anything but these loggers came around a bend they started shooting shotguns at the tribe and the tribe scattered into the forest and as the logger's boat went around and bend they just started flying arrows mhmm took out the boat driver boat skidded to the side and then everybody was standing in the river and you can't run and the tribe just descended on them and just porcupine them full of arrows shotgun versus bow there's a shotgun shell here by the way yeah from the from the loggers mhmm yeah we picked that up yesterday was that yesterday that was i don't know i don't know one of the things that happens here is time loses meaning in in some kind of deep way that it does when you're in a big city in the united states for example and there's schedules and meetings and all this kind of stuff it transforms the meaning your experience of time your interaction with time the role of time all of this i've forgotten time and i've forgotten the existence of the outside world and how does that feel it feels more honest it also puts in perspective like all the busyness all the it kinda takes the ant out of the ant colony and says hey this you're just an ant this is just an ant colony and there's a big world out there yeah it's a it's a chance to to be grateful to celebrate this earth of ours and the things that make it worth living on including the simple things that make the individual life worth living which is water and then food and the rest is just details of course the friendships and social interaction that's a really big one actually that one i'm taking for granted because i didn't get a chance yet to really spend time alone and when i came here i've gotten a chance to hang out with you and there's a kind of camaraderie there's a friendship there that if that's broken that's a that's a tough that's a tough one too you spent quite a lot of time alone in the jungle you ever get alone out here yeah yeah i mean the first fifteen years we were doing this we there would be times that jj would be busy in town with his family and i would for sheer love of the rainforest i would have to come alone out here and we didn't have running i didn't have running water i didn't have lights all i had was a couple of candles in the darkness and a tent and i was twenty something years old living in the amazon by myself your boat sunk and yeah it's incredibly lonely i i had to learn through experience because i thought there's a period i think when you're you know you're young as a young man i i i had this thing like i wanted to prove that i could be like the explorers i wanted to prove that i could handle the elements that i could go out alone that i could have these these deep connective moments with the with the jungle and it's like i did that and that's great and you know what the kid from into the wild learned right before he died in that bus that if you don't have somebody to share it with it doesn't matter but i don't know some kinda like even just deep human level like even if you have somebody to share it with you ever just get alone out here just like this sense of like existential dread of like what you know the jungle has a way of not caring about any individual organism it just kinda churns it's like it makes you realize that life is finite quite intensely yeah for for for me it's comforting being out here because i find the the rat race the national narrative the the the the need to make money the to worry about war to to be outraged about the newest thing that that politician said and what that actor did and and it it just there's always just this just unending sort of media storm and and and and everyone's worried and everyone's trying to optimize their sunlight exposure and find the solution and buy the right new thing and to me coming out here first of all i mean something out here because i can help someone i can help people i can help these animals and so i find my meaning out here but also you know there's the losing the madness over the mountains it's it's nature has always and for many people been where things make sense and to me i think i'm a simple analog type of person that it makes sense that when it rains you get in the river to stay warm and and you you know you wait for the dawn and you see a little tree snake and and you say it just it just it makes it makes more sense and i think that the the the overwhelming teeming complexity that is inside the the ant mound of society can be dizzying for some people and i think that maybe it's the dyslexia maybe it's just that i love nature but now if i when i land in jfk i i feel like a frightened animal on on like it like it's it's as if you as if you release like a like a some animal that had never seen it onto like and into times square and you could just imagine this dog with its ears back running away from taxis and just just cowering from the noise and it's just hustle and bustle and people are brutal and how much you want it for get in the car and just screaming over the intercom and just everything everything sensory changes and let's get home okay let's go you got a meeting you gotta get to the next place you gotta give a talk you gotta sign out out out here when we finish up here what are we gonna do we're gonna eat some food maybe go catch a crocodile go walk around the jungle and i like it's slower it makes sense and and there's that again there's that deep meaning of of of that here where we can be the guardians for good we can we can be we can hold that candle up and and know for sure that we're protecting the trees from being destroyed and it's that simple thing of just this is good there you go it's simple in society i feel like everyone's always losing their minds and forgetting the most basic of fundamental truths and out here you can't really argue with them you know when we needed water it was like shit if we don't get water we're fucked mhmm and that and that's to me that's where the camaraderie comes from because mhmm no matter what we'll be we could go to the most fancy ass restaurant through the biggest most famous people in the world doesn't matter we still remember what it was like standing around in the jungle going fuck we're scared we don't have water we got reduced to the simplest form of humans and that's and that's something and we survived and that's and that's cool and you take all the all those people in their nice dresses in their fancy restaurants and you put them in those conditions they're all gonna want the same thing as water and yes it's all the same thing all the beautiful people how has your view of your own mortality evolved over your interaction with the jungle how often do you think about your death well i don't anymore because the i've come to believe that there is a benevolent god spirit creator taking care of us and i don't i don't think about my own death we have a little bit of time here and we clearly know nothing about what we're doing here mhmm and it seems like we just have to do the best we can and so i just it doesn't it doesn't scare me i've come close to dying a lot of times and i just don't think you don't wanna have a bad death first of all you don't wanna you don't wanna you don't wanna be a statistic you don't wanna find out you don't wanna like try out a be the first to try out a new product and oops it crushed you mhmm you know that that's that's a terrible way to go or the people that used to you know in the gold rush they were using mercury and they're all getting or lead it was lead poisoning and it's like oh you know few million people died that way and it's like you wanna you want a good death you know you wanna staring down the eyes of a tiger or hanging off the edge of a cliff saving somebody's something something something worthy warrior's death mhmm but if you riding a sixteen foot black cayman just boots on screaming yeah that'd be fun that'd be a good one a lot of people say that you carry the spirit of steve irwin in in your heart in the way you carry yourself in this world i mean he that guy was full of joy if i have a percentage of steve irwin i would be honored but that guy that thing i think there's only one steve i think that he he occupied his own strata of just shining light every everything was positive enthusiasm love and happiness and save the animals and do better and let's make it fun and and and that was so infectious that that it sort of transcended his tv show it transcended his conservation work it transcended business and entrepreneurship it just through sheer magnetism and enthusiasm he just i mean everyone knew who steve was everyone loved steve we still all love steve and so it's it's just it's just amazing what one spirit can do so if anybody you know makes that comparison i i get i get really uncomfortable because to me steve irwin is like just just the goat and so i'm okay with that well i at least agree with that comparison having spent time with you there's just an eternal flame of joy and adventure too just pulling you a dark question but do you think you might meet the same end giving your life in some way to something you love that is a dark question but i i i think most likely i'll get whacked by loggers i think that loggers or gold miners will take me out i don't i don't picture myself going from animals but that would be heartbreaking too yeah it would but yeah at the same time though like the kurt cobain value of that if i died doing what i love to protect the river i'd be so worth so much more a lot like we'd get the thirty million if i died tomorrow for sure so we've already we've already talked about this with my friends i'm like if i get whacked do the foundation make the documentary protect the river protect the heartbeats call it the heartbeats jungle keepers the heartbeats you know be ready for it because these these things do happen people get pissed if you get in their way and as many happy people as and who whose lives were changing there's also gonna be some jealous shitty upset people who are mad that they can't make prostitutes out of young girls and keep destroying the planet and so they might just erase you me well i hope you like a clint eastwood character just just impossible to kill i would say i like how you squinted your eyes on cue who do you think will play you in a movie god somebody with the right nose yeah somebody who can live up to this schnozzle yeah alright italian yeah it's funny do you think of yourself as italian or human american that's the thing i don't i you know abe my my life has been the united nations of of whatever like i just every to me i i just i don't that's the other thing you go back to society and everyone's obsessed with with race to me i'm like look leopards have black babies and yellow babies one mother like they're all leopards mhmm and and i'm i'm so colorblind and race blind and everything else i've lived in india my friends are peruvian my family we got italian filipino just everything and so i've i'm so immersed in it that that when i i find it very jarring and disconcerting how much time we spend talking about different religions and just the differences in humans i'm like dude we're we're talking about whether or not our ecosystems are gonna be able to provide for us we're talking about nuclear what we're talking about there's some pretty serious shit on the table and we're over here arguing over like shades of gray of of it's it's so trivial and that shit drives me crazy and and as does the outrage where it's like no you you you have to care i've been i've been criticized for not caring enough about that and i'm like i'm gonna i'm gonna who cares what the hell i am who gives a shit what the hell i'm a human we're all human yeah it's not that easy but it's kinda fun sometimes and and we're at a better time and hit like when you think about like the middle ages like even if you were a king mhmm you still didn't have it that good you didn't have pineapples in the winter you didn't even know what the fuck a pineapple was we have pineapples whenever we want them mhmm we can fly on planes to other countries by the way let's clarify we you mean a large fraction of the world you know i mentioned to you one of the biggest things i've noticed when i immigrated from the soviet union to the united states is the how plentiful bananas and pineapples were the fruit section the produce section of the didn't have to wait in line at the grocery store could just eat as many bananas and pineapples and cherries and watermelon as as you want that's not everybody has that no that's true not everybody has that but but but everybody could be that king no but but but a growing number of people today can feast on pineapple can feast on pineapple and have toasters and new distracting apps all the way until the grave that's the thing that i also noticed is i don't think so much about politics while i'm here or we haven't even talked about it we haven't don't talk about the stupid differences between humans nah except to just kinda laugh at the absurdity of it on occasion busy trying to survive glaciers and jungles and avalanches and all kinds of shit do you think nature is brutal as werner herzog showed it or is it beautiful i think the brutality of nature is the chaos and i think that we are the only ones in it that are capable of organizing in the direction of order and light so yes there are gonna be hyenas tearing each other apart yes there's gonna be war torn nations and poor starving children but we as humans have the power to work towards something more organized than that so there is a there is a force within nature that's always searching for order for good it's kind of a unifying theory if you think about it i mean all of the chaos of history and the wars and and and the chaos of nature we we through technology and and organization there's so many people more people today than ever before i think who are so concerned who realize that the incredible power like what jane goodall says about you know how you can affect the people around you how you can do good in the world how you can change the narrative of conservation from one of loss and darkness to one of innovation and light like we can we can do incredible things we are the masters as humans and i think that i think that we're at on the cusp of sort of understanding the true potential of that like i just think i just think that more than ever people people have harnessed this ability to do good in the world and be proud of it and and and just change the the the darkness into something else when you have lived here and taken in the ways of the amazon jungle how have your views of god you mentioned how have your views of god change who is god i've come to believe that again back to that that christ wasn't a christian mohammed wasn't a muslim and buddha wasn't a buddhist that like the game the game is love and compassion and the universe is chaotic and dangerous and nature is chaotic and dangerous but we if if this is some sort of a biological video game the our reality that the test is can we be good and we go through it every day can you can you be good to your parent can you be good to your partner can you be good to your coworkers can it's so difficult and we see how people can cheat and steal and hurt and destroy and and the incredible impact that it has on the world the the returning exponential impact that one act of kindness one act of good can do and so i see nature as god i see the religions as diff different cultural manifestations of the same truth the same creative force maybe me and you have the same beliefs and your aliens are my angels well thank you for being one of the humans trying to do good in this world and thank you for bringing me along for some adventure and i believe more adventure awaits thank you for being enough of a psychopath to actually just sign on to come into the amazon rainforest in a suit and a year ago when you told me that you were gonna do this i truly didn't believe you so for being a man of your word and for the incredible work you do to connect humans and to create dialogue and to do good in the world and for all the adventures that we've had thank you so much thank you brother lex thanks man thanks for listening to this conversation with paul rosalie to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from joseph campbell the big question is whether you are going to be able to say a hearty yes to your adventure thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
