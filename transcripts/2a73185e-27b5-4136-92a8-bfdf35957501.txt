the following is a conversation with greg lukianoff free speech advocate first amendment attorney president and ceo of fire the foundation for individual rights and expression and he's the author of unleashing liberty coauthor with jonathan haidt of coddling of the american mind and coauthor with ricky schlott of a new book coming out in october that you should definitely preorder now called the canceling of the american mind which is a definitive accounting of the history present and future of cancel culture a term used and overused in public discourse but rarely studied and understood with the depth and rigor that greg and ricky do in this book and in part in this conversation freedom of speech is important especially on college campuses the very place that should serve as the battleground of ideas including weird and controversial ones that should encourage bold risk taking not conformity and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description

policygenius a marketplace for finding and buying insurance boy can i tell you some stories about life and death i've been hard at work tolling over videos that i recorded in ukraine still looking to publish soon there's just so much it's so personal it's so rich with feeling and in one of the conversations one of the soldiers has a kind of philosophical existential discussion about life and he describes this tension of having a kind of infinite value for life because it's so visceral in a time of war but also not having such a high value for life that you know functioning as a soldier becomes debilitating so i don't know something about that tension that really really stayed with me about the value of life when we look around us how much we value life when we look in the mirror how much do we value life that's something i constantly think about when i meditate on my own mortality and when i do think about my own death and the death of people i love the value of life becomes so intensely clear that life is beautiful and every single moment is precious so it's funny when you think about getting insurance of any kind and especially when you think about getting life insurance those kinds of questions come to the surface of what is the worth of life and also the just the actual fact of death comes to the surface it's a beautifully pragmatic metaphysical psychological human

big question what is cancel culture now you've said that you don't like the term as it's been quote dragged through the mud and abused endlessly by a whole host of controversial figures nevertheless we have the term what is it cancel culture is the uptick of campaigns especially successful campaigns starting around twenty fourteen to get people fired expelled deplatformed etcetera for speech that would normally be protected by the first amendment and i say would be protected because we're talking about circumstances in which it isn't necessarily where the first amendment applies but what i mean is like as an analog to say things you couldn't lose your job as a public employee for and also the climate of fear that's resulted from from that phenomena the fact that you can lose your job for having the wrong opinion and it wasn't subtle that this there was an uptick in this particularly on on campus around twenty fourteen john ronson wrote a book called so you've been publicly shamed that came out in twenty fifteen already documenting this phenomena i wrote a book called freedom from speech in twenty fourteen and but in but it really was in twenty seventeen when you started seeing this be directed at professors and when it comes to the number of professors that we've seen you know be be targeted and lose their jobs i've been doing this for twenty two years and i've seen nothing like it so there's so many things i wanna ask you here but one actually just look at the organization of fire can you explain what the organization is because it's interconnected to this whole fight and the rise of cancel culture and the fight for freedom of speech since twenty fourteen and before so fire was founded in nineteen ninety nine by harvey silverglade he is a famous civil liberties attorney he's he's a bit bit on the show he's the person who actually found me out in my very happy life out in san francisco but knew i was looking for a first amendment job i'd gone to law school specifically to do first amendment and he he found me which was pretty cool his his protege kathleen sullivan was the dean of stanford law school and this remains the best compliment i ever got in my life is that she recommended me to harvey and since that's the whole reason why i went to law school i was excited to be a part of this new organization the other cofounder of of fire is alan charles kors he's just an absolute genius he is the one of the leading experts courses mhmm he has a lecture on blaise pascal and blaise of course is famous for the pascal's wager and i left it just so moved and impressed and under with a depth of understanding of how important this person was that's interesting you mentioned to me offline connected to this that there is that at least it runs in parallel or there's a connection between the love of science and the love of the freedom of speech yes can you maybe elaborate where that connection is sure i think that for those of us who are really you know who've devoted our lives to freedom of speech one thing that we are into whether we know it or not is epistemology you know for the the the study and philosophy of knowledge you know freedom of speech has lots of moral and philosophical dimensions but from a pragmatic standpoint it is necessary because we're creatures of incredibly limited knowledge we are incredibly self deceiving i always love the fact that yuval harari refers to the enlightenment as the discovery of ignorance because that's exactly what it was it was suddenly being like wow hold on a second all this incredibly interesting folk wisdom we got which by the way is can be can be surprisingly reliable here and there when you start testing a lot of it is nonsense and it doesn't hold up even our ideas about the way things fall you know as galileo established like even our intuitions they're just wrong and so a lot of the early history of freedom of speech it was happening at the same time as sort of the scientific revolution so a lot of the early debates about freedom of speech were tied in so certainly galileo you know i always point out like kepler was probably like the even more radical idea that there weren't even perfect spheres but but at the same time largely because of the invention of the printing press you also had all these political developments and you know i always talk about jan hus you know from the a famous czech hero who was burned at the stake and i think in fourteen nineteen but he was basically luther before the printing press before luther could get his word out you know he didn't stand a chance and that was exactly what jan hus was but a century later thanks to the printing press everyone could know what luther thought and boy did they but it led to of course this completely crazy hyper disrupted period in in in european history well you mentioned to jump around a little bit the first amendment first of all what is the first amendment and what is the connection to you between the first amendment the freedom of speech and cancel culture sure so i'm a first amendment lawyer as as i mentioned and that's what i you know that's my passion that's what i studied and i think american first amendment law is incredibly interesting in one sentence the the first amendment is trying to get rid of basically all the reasons why humankind had been killing each other for its entire existence that we weren't going to fight any more over opinion we weren't gonna fight any more religion that you have the right to approach your government for redress of grievances that you have the freedom to associate that all of these things in one sentence were like nope the government will no longer interfere with your right to have these fundamental human rights and so one thing that makes fire a little different from other organizations is is however we're not just a first amendment organization we are a free speech organization and so and and but at the same time a lot of what i think free speech is can be well explained with reference to a lot of first amendment law mhmm partially because in in american history some of our smartest people have been thinking about what the parameters of freedom of speech are in relationship to the first amendment viewpoint discrimination that essentially you allow freedom of speech is called viewpoint discrimination that essentially you allow freedom of speech except for that opinion now it's and it's found to be kind of more defensible and i think this makes sense that if if you set up a forum and like we're only gonna talk about economics mhmm to exclude people who wanna talk about a different topic but it's considered rightfully a a a bigger deal if you've set up a forum for economics but we're not gonna let people talk about that kind of economics or have that opinion on economics what most most particularly so a lot of the principles from first amendment law actually make a lot of philosophical sense as good principles for when like what is protected and unprotected speech what should get you in trouble how you actually analyze it which is why we actually try in our definition of cancel culture to work in some of the first amendment norms just in the definition so we don't have to bog down on them as well you're saying so many interesting things but if you can link on the viewpoint discrimination is there any gray area of discussion there like what isn't isn't economics for the example you gave yeah is it is there i mean is it a science is it or is it an art to draw lines of what is and isn't allowed yeah you know if you're saying that something is or is not economics well you can say everything's economics and therefore i wanna talk about poetry there'd be some line drawing exercise in there but let's say at once you decide to open up it it to poetry even it's a big difference between saying okay now we're open to poetry but you can't say you know dante was bad like that's an that's a forbidden opinion now officially in in this otherwise open forum that would immediately at an intuitive level strike people as a bigger problem than just saying that poetry isn't economics yeah i mean that intuitive level that you speak to i hope that all of us have that kind of basic intuition when the line is crossed it's the same thing for like pornography yes you know when you see it i i think there's the same level of intuition that should be applied across the board here mhmm and it's when that intuition becomes deformed by whatever forces of society that's when it starts to feel like censorship yeah i mean people find it a different thing you know if someone loses their job simply for their political opinion even if that employer has every right in the world to fire you i think americans should still be like well it's true they have every right in the world and i i'm not making a legal case that maybe you shouldn't fire someone for their political opinion but think that through like what what society do we wanna what kind of society do we wanna live in and it's been funny watching you know and i and i i point this out yes i will defend businesses first amendment rights of association to be able to have the legal right to decide you know who works for them but from a moral or philosophical matter if you think through the implications of if every business in in america becomes an expressive association in addition to being a profit maximizing organization that would be a disaster for democracy because you would end up in a situation where people would actually be saying to themselves i don't think i can actually say what i really think and and still believe i can keep my job and that's where i was worried i felt like we were headed because a lot of the initial response to people getting canceled was very simply you know oh but they have the right to get rid of this person and that and and that's that's the end and be beginning and end of the discussion and i thought that was a dodge i thought that wasn't actually a very serious way of that if you care about both the first amendment and freedom of speech of thinking it through so to you just to clarify the first amendment is kinda a legal embodiment of the ideal of freedom of speech and then freedom of speech applied to government and it's very specific it applied to government and freedom of speech is the application of the principle to like everything including like kinda the high level philosophical ideal of what it of the value of people being able to speak their mind yeah it's it's an older bolder i more expansive idea and you can have a situation and i and i talk about countries that have good free speech law but not necessarily great free speech culture and i talk about how when we sometimes make this distinction between free speech law and free speech culture we're thinking in a very cloudy kind of way and what i mean by that is that law is generally particularly in a common law country it it's the reflection of norms those you know judges are people too and in a lot of cases common law is supposed to actually take our intuitive ideas of fairness and and place them you know into the law so if you actually have a culture that doesn't appreciate free speech from a philosophical standpoint it's not going to be able to protect free speech for the long haul even in the law because eventually that's one of the reasons why i worry so much about some of these terrible cases coming out of law schools because i i fear that even though sure american first amendment law is very strongly protective of first amendment for now it's not gonna stay that way if you have generations of law students graduating who actually think there's nothing there's no higher goal than shouting down you're an opponent yeah so that's why so much of your focus or a large fraction of your focus is on the higher education or education period is because education is the foundation of culture yeah you have this history you know sixty four you have the free speech movement on berkeley mhmm and in sixty five you have repressive tolerance by herbert marcuse which was a declaration of by the way we on the left we we shouldn't we should have free speech but we should have free speech for us i mean i i went went back and reread repressive tolerance and how clear it is i i forgot i had forgotten that it really is kind of like and these so called conservatives and right wingers we need to repress them because they're regressive thinkers it really doesn't come out to anything more sophisticated than the very old idea that our people are good they get free speech mhmm we should they should keep it other side bad we we should not have and we have to retrain society and of course like it it it ends up being another and he was also a fan of mao so it's not surprising that he that of course the system would have to rely on some kind of totalitarian system but that was a laughable position you know say thirty forty years ago the idea that essentially know free speech for me not for thee as as the great you know free speech champion nat hentoff used to say was something that you were supposed to be embarrassed by but i saw this when i was in in in law school in ninety seven i saw this when i was interning at the aclu in ninety nine that there was a slow motion train wreck coming that essentially there was these bad ideas from campus that had been taking on more and more steam of basically no free speech for my opponent mhmm were actually becoming more more and more accepted as and partially because academia was becoming less and less viewpoint diverse i i think that as my coauthor jonathan haidt points out that when you have low viewpoint diversity people start thinking in a very kind of tribal way and if you don't have the respected dissenters you don't have the people that you can point to that i'm like hey this is a smart person this is like this is a smart reasonable decent person that i that i disagree with so i guess not everyone thinks alike on this issue mhmm you start getting much more kind of like only you know only bad people only heretics only blasphemers only right wingers you know can actually think in this way every time you say something i always have a million thoughts and a million questions that pop up but since you mentioned there's a kind of drift as you write about in the book and you mentioned now there's a drift towards the left in academia we should also maybe draw a distinction here between the left and the right and the cancel culture as you present in your book sure is not necessarily associated with any one political viewpoint that there's mechanisms on both sides oh yeah that result in cancellation and censorship in violation of freedom of speech so one thing i wanna be really clear about is the book takes on both right and left cancel culture they're different in a lot of ways and definitely you know cancel culture from the left is more important in academia where the left dominates but we talk a lot about cancel culture coming from legislatures we talk a lot about cancel culture on campus as well because even though most of the attempts that come from on campus to get people canceled are still from the left there are a lot of attacks that come from the right that come from you know attempts by the different organizations and sometimes when there are stories in fox news you know like they'll go after professors and about one third of the attempts to get professors punished that are successful actually do come from the right and and we talk about attempts to get books banned in in the in the book we talk about and i talk about suing the florida legislature ron desantis had something called the stop woke act which we told everyone this is laughably unconstitutional they tried to ban you know particular topics in higher ed and we're like no this is a joke like this will be laughed out of court and they didn't listen to us and they brought it they passed it and we sued and we won now they're trying again with something that's equally as unconstitutional and we will sue again and we will and we will win can you elaborate on the stop woke access presumably trying to limit certain topics from being taught in school yeah basically woke topics you know it it's more it came out of the sort of attempt to get at critical race theory so it it's topics related to race gender etcetera i don't remember exactly how they tried to cabinet to to to crt but when you actually the law is really well established that you can't tell higher education what they're allowed to teach without violating without violating the first amendment and when this got in front of a judge it was exactly as he was exactly as skeptical of it as as we thought he'd be i think he called this dystopian and it it wasn't a a close call so if you're against that kind of teaching the right way to fight it is by making the case that it's not a good idea as part of the curriculum as opposed to banning it from the curriculum yeah it just the state doesn't have the power to simply say to to ban you know what what teach what professors in higher education teach now it gets a little more complicated when you talk about k through twelve because the state has a role in deciding what public k through twelve teaches because they're your kids they it's taxpayer funded and generally the legislature is involved there is democratic oversight of that process so for k through twelve is there also a lean towards the left in terms of the administration that manages the curriculum yeah there there there definitely is in k through twelve the the i mean my kids go to public school i have a five and a seven year old and they have lovely teachers but we have run into a lot of problems with with education schools at fire and a lot of the graduates of education school end up being the administrators who clamp down on free speech in higher education and so i've been trying to think of positive ways to take on some of the some of the problems that i see in k three twelve i thought that the attempt to just dictate you you won't teach the following ten books you know or twenty books or two hundred books was the wrong way to do it now when it comes to deciding what books are in the curriculum again that's something the legislature actually you know can have some say in and that's pretty uncontroversial in terms of the law but when it comes to how you fight it i had something that since i'm kinda stuck with a formula i called empowering of the american mind i gave principles that were inconsistent with the sort of groupthink and heavy emphasis on identity politics that you know some of the critics are rightfully complaining about in k through twelve and we we that is actually in canceling of the american mind but i have a more detailed explanation of it that i'm gonna be putting up on my blog the eternally radical idea is it possible to legally this is a silly question perhaps mhmm create an extra protection for certain kinds of literature nineteen eighty four or something to to remain in the curriculum i mean it's already it's all protected i guess yeah i i i guess to protect against administrators from fiddling too much with the curriculum like stabilizing the curriculum i don't i don't know what the machinery of the k through twelve public school in k through twelve you know state legislatures you know they're part of that they're they're part of that and they can say like you should teach the following books right now of course people are always a little bit worried that if you if they were to recommend you know teach teach the declaration of independence you know that it will end up being well they're gonna teach the declaration of independence was just to protect slavery which yeah it wasn't yeah so teaching a particular topic matters which textbooks you choose which perspective you take all that kind of stuff yeah there's like religion starts to creep into the whole question of like how you know is the bible are you allowed to teach incorporate that into education don't yeah i mean i'm i'm an atheist with an intense interest in religion i actually read the entire bible this year just because i do stuff like that and i never actually had read it begin from beginning to end then i read the quran because you know and i'm gonna try to do the book of mormon but you know well sorry tell you you're so fascinating do you recommend doing that i think you should just to know because it's such a touchstone in in the way people talk about things it can get pretty tedious but i even made myself read through all of the very specific instructions on how tall the different parts of the temple need to be and how long the garbs need to be and what shape they need to be and what like and those go on a lot that surprisingly surprisingly big chunk of exodus i thought that was more like in leviticus and deuteronomy but then you get to books like job you know wow i mean job is such a read and no way job originally had that ending like job is basically it starts out as this perverse bet between god and satan about whether or not they can actually make a good man renounce god and initially they can't it's all going very predictably and then they finally really torture job and he turns into the best why is god cruel how could god possibly exist how could a kind god do these things and he beats he turns into like the best lawyer in the entire world and he defeats everyone all the people who come to argue with him he he he argues the pants off of them and then suddenly at the end god shows up and he's like well you know i am everywhere and it's a very confusing answer he gets an answer kind of like i am there when when when lionesses give birth and i am there and by the way there's this giant monster leviathan that's very big and it's very scary and i and i have to manage the universe and i'm kind of like god are you saying that you're very busy is that it it it it is that essentially your argument to job and you don't mention the whole you don't mention the whole kind of like that i i i have a bet that's why i was torturing you that doesn't come up yeah and then at the end he decide the gods decides like job's like oh no you're totally right i was totally wrong sorry and and god says i'm gonna punish those people who tried to argue with you and didn't didn't win so so we get rid of the the the i don't know exactly what he does to them i don't remember and then he gives job all his money back and all and it makes him super prosperous and i'm like no way that was the original ending of that book like because this would like this was clearly a beloved novel that they were like but it can't have that ending okay so so so so yeah so it's a long way of saying i actually think it's worthwhile some of it was you're always kinda surprised when you end up in the part like there are parts of it that will sneak up on you kind of like isaiah's a trip ecclesiastes depeche mode and you did you said you also the the quran yeah which was fascinating so what is there it'd be interesting to ask is there a tension between the study of religious texts or the the following of religion and just believing in god and following the the various aspects of religion with freedom of speech in the first amendment we we have something that we call the religion clause and i've never liked calling it just that because it's two brilliant things right next to each other the state may not establish an official religion but it cannot interfere with your right to practice your religion yes beautiful two two two two things at the same time and i think they're and i think they're both exactly right and i think sometimes the right gets very excited of the exercise clause and the left gets very excited about establishment and i like the fact that we have we have both of them together now how does this relate to freedom of speech and i was right to the curriculum like we were talking about i actually think it would be great if public schools could teach the bible like in the sense of like read it as a historical document but back when i was at the aclu every time i saw people trying this it always turned into them actually advocating for you know a catholic or a protestant or some or orthodox even kind of like read on religion so if you actually make it into something advocating for a particular view on religion then it crosses into the establishment clause side so americans haven't figured out a way to actually teach it so it's probably better that you you know learn learn about outside of a public school class do you think it's possible to teach religion from like world religions kind of course without disrespecting the religions i think the answer is it depends on from whose perspective well like the practitioners say you're like an orthodox follower of a particular religion yeah is it possible to not piss you off in teaching like all the major religions of the world for some people the bottom line is you have to teach it as true ah and with that under those conditions then the answer is no you can't teach it without offending someone at least can't you say these people believe it's true can you reform so you have to walk on eggshells essentially you you you can try really hard and you will still make some people angry but serious people will be like oh no you actually tried to be fair to to the beliefs here and i i and i try to be respectful as much as i can about a lot of this i still find myself much more drawn to both buddhism and stoicism where do i go okay one one interesting thing to get back to college campuses is the fire keeps the college free speech rankings yes at rankings dot the fire dot org i'm very proud of them i highly recommend because forget the even just the ranking you get to learn a lot about the universities from this entirely different perspective than people are used to when they go to pick whatever university they wanna go to it just gives another perspective on the whole thing and it gives quotes from people that are students there and so on like about their experiences and and it gives different maybe you could speak to the the various measures here before we talk about who's in the top five and who's in the bottom five what what what are the different parameters that contribute to the evaluation so people have been asking me since day one to do a ranking of schools according to freedom of speech and even though we had we had the best database in existence of campus speech codes policies that universities have that violate first amendment or first amendment norms we also have the best database of of we call the disinvitation database it's but it's actually the it's better named the deplatforming database which is what what we're gonna call it and these are all cases where somebody was invited as a speaker to campus yep and then were disinvited disinvited or deplatforming also includes shouting down so so they showed up and they couldn't really speak yeah exactly and and and so having that what we really needed in order to have some serious social science to really make a serious argument about what the ranking was was to be able to one get a better sense of how many professors were actually getting punished during this time and then the the the biggest missing element was to be able to ask students directly what the environment was like on that campus for freedom of speech are you comfortable disagreeing with each other are you comfortable disagreeing with your with your professors do you think violence is acceptable in response to a speaker do you think shouting do you think shouting down is okay do you think blocking people's access to a speaker is okay and once we were able to get all those elements together we first did a a test run i think in nine twenty nineteen of about fifty and we've been doing it for four years now always trying to make the methodology more and more precise to better reflect the actual environment at particular schools and this year the number one school was michigan technological university which was a nice surprise the number two school was which was nice to see in the top ten the most well known prestigious school is actually uva which did really well this year university of chicago was not happy that they weren't number one but university of chicago was thirteen and they had been number one or in the top three for years prior to that really so can you explain it's almost surprising is it because of like the really strong economics departments and things like this or what why they had a case involving a student they wouldn't recognize a chapter of turning point usa and they made a very classic argument that we and classic in the bad way that we hear at campuses across the country oh we have a campus republicans so we don't need this additional conservative group and we're like no i'm sorry like we've seen dozens and dozens if not hundreds of attempts to get this one particular conservative student student group derecognized or not recognized and so we told them like listen this like we told them at fire that you know we consider this serious and they wouldn't recognize the group so that that's a point down in our ranking and it was enough to knock them from they probably would have been number two in the rankings but now they're thirteen out of two forty eight they're still one of the best schools in the country i have no problem saying that the school that did not do so well at a negative ten point six nine mhmm negative ten point six nine and we rounded up to zero mhmm was harvard and harvard has been not very happy with that result the only school to receive the abysmal ranking yeah and there are a couple people oh harvard oh harvard and there are a couple people who've actually been really i think making a mistake by getting very harvard sounding by being like i've had statisticians look at this and they and they they they think your methodology is a joke and and like pointing out and in this case wasn't that important and that scholar wasn't one of the archivist against one of the scholars that we counted against them for punishing was that that wasn't a very you know famous or influential scholar kinda like so your your argument seems to be snobbery like essentially that like you you're you're not understanding our methodology for one thing and then you're saying that actually that scholar wasn't important enough to count and by the way harvard by the way harvard if we the harvard candidate yeah if we even if we took all of your arguments as true even if we decided to get rid of those two professors you would still be in negative numbers you would still be dead last you would still be after georgetown and penn and neither of those schools are good for freedom of speech i should say the the the bottom five is the university of pennsylvania like you said penn the university of south carolina georgetown university and fordham university all very well earned they they have so many bad cases at all of those schools what's the best way to find yourself in the bottom five if you're in university what's what's the fastest way to that negative to that zero a lot of deplatforming love it it it that when we looked at the bottom five eighty one percent of attempts to get speakers deplatformed were successful at the bottom five there there were a couple schools i think penn included where every single attempt every time a student like objected a student group objected to that speaker coming they canceled this this speech and i think i think georgetown was a hundred percent success rate i think penn had a hundred percent success rate i think harvard did stand up for a couple but mostly people got deplatformed there as well so how do you push back on deplatforming well who who would do it is it other students is it faculty is it the administration what's the dynamics of of pushing back of basically because i imagine some of it is culture but i imagine every university has a bunch of students who will protest basically every speaker and it's a question of how you respond to that protest well here's here's the dirty little secret about like the big change in twenty fourteen and and fire and me me and hite have been very clear that the big change that we saw on campus was that for most of my career students were great on freedom of speech they were the best constituency for free speech absolutely unambiguously until about twenty thirteen twenty fourteen and it was only in twenty fourteen where we had this very you know kinda sad for us experience experience where suddenly students were the ones advocating for deplatforming and new speech codes kind of in a similar way that they had been doing in say like the mid eighties for example but here's the dirty little secret it's not this it's just the students it's students and administrators some sometimes only a handful of them though working together to make to to create some of these problems and this was exactly what happened at stanford when kyle duncan a fifth circuit judge tried to speak at my alma mater and a fifth of the class showed up to shout him down it was a real showing of the of what was what was going on that ten minutes into the shout down of a fifth circuit judge and i keep on emphasizing that because i'm a constitutional lawyer fifth circuit judge judges are big deals they're one level below the supreme court you know about a fifth of the school shows up to shout him down after ten minutes of shouting him down an administrator a dei administrator gets up with a prepared speech that she that she's written that's a seven minute long speech where she talks about free speech maybe the juice isn't worth the squeeze and we we we're at this law school where people could learn to challenge these norms so it's clear that there was coordination you know amongst some of these administrators and from talking to students there they were in meetings extensive meetings for a long time they show up do a shout down then they take an additional seven minutes to to to lecture the speaker on free speech not being not the juice of free speech not being worth the squeeze and then for the rest of it it's just constant heckling after she after she leaves this is clearly and this and and something very similar you know happened a number of times at yale where it was very clearly administrators were helping along with with a lot of these disruptions so i think every time there is a shout down at a university the investigation should be first and foremost did administrators help create this problem did they do anything to stop it because i think a lot of what's really going on here is the hyper bureaucratization of universities with a lot more ideological people who think of their primary job as basically like policing speech more or less mhmm they're encouraging students sorry they're encouraging students who have opinions they like mhmm to do shout downs and that's why they really need to investigate this and it is at stanford the administrator who who gave the prepared remarks about the juice not being worth the squeeze she has not been invited back to stanford but she's one of the only examples i can think of when these things happen a lot where an administrator clearly facilitated something that was a shout down or a deplatforming or resulted in a professor getting fired or resulted in a student getting expelled where the administrator has got off scot free or probably in some cases even gotten a promotion and so a small number of administrators maybe even a single administrator could participate in the encouraging and the organization and thereby empower the whole process and that's something i've seen throughout my entire career and the only thing is it's kind of hard to catch this sort of in the act so to speak and that's one of the reasons why it's helpful for people to know about this you know because it there was this amazing case this was at university of washington and we've actually featured this in a documentary made in twenty fifteen twenty that came out in twenty fifteen twenty sixteen called can we take a joke and this was when we started noticing something was changing on campus we also heard that comedians were saying that they couldn't use their good humor anymore this was right around the time that jerry seinfeld and chris rock said that they couldn't they didn't wanna play on campuses because they they could they they they couldn't be funny but we featured a case of a comedian who wanted to do a musical called the passion of the musical making fun of the passion of the christ with the stated goal of offending everyone every group equally it was very very much a south park mission mhmm and it's an unusual case because we actually got documentation of administrators buying tickets for angry students and holding an event where they where they train them to to jump up in the middle of it and shout i'm offended like they they they bought them tickets they sent them to this this thing with the goal of shouting it down now unsurprisingly when you send an angry group of students to shut down a play it it's not gonna end at just i'm offended and it got heated there were death threats being thrown the the and and then the pullman washington police told chris chris lee the guy who made the play that he they wouldn't actually protect him now it's not every day you're gonna have that kind of hard evidence that that that of actually seeing the administrators be so so brazen that they recorded the fact that they bought them tickets and sent them but i think a lot of that stuff is is going on and i think it's the the it's a good excuse to cut down on one of the big problems in higher education today which is hyper bureaucratization in your experience is there a distinction between administrators and faculty in terms of perpetrators of this of these kinds of things so if if we got rid of all like harvey's talked about getting rid of a large percentage of the administration does that help fix the problem or is the faculty also yeah small percent of the faculty also part of the encouraging in the organization of these kind of cancel models yeah and and that's something that has been profoundly disappointing is that when you look at the huge uptick in attempts to get professors fired that we've seen over the last ten years and actually over the last twenty two years as far back as our our records go at first they were overwhelmingly led by administrators to attempts to get professors punished and that was most you know i'd say that was my career up until twenty thirteen was was fighting back at administrative excesses then you start having the problem in twenty fourteen of students trying to get people canceled and that really accelerated in twenty seventeen and the number so one one way that one one thing that makes it easier to document is are the petitions to get professors fired or punished and how disproportionately that those actually do come from students but another big uptick has been fellow professors demanding that their fellow professors get punished and that to me it's really sad it's kinda shameful you you you shouldn't be proud of signing the petition to get your fellow professor and what's what's even more more more shameful is that we get this this is a this has almost become a cliche within fire when someone is facing the one of these cancellation campaigns as a professor i would get letters from some of my friends saying i am so sorry this has happened to you and these were the same people who publicly signed the petition to get them fired yeah yeah yeah integrity integrity is an important thing in this world and i think some of it i'm so surprised people don't stand up more for this i know because there's so much hunger for it and if you have the guts as a faculty or administrator to really stand stand up with eloquence with rigor with integrity i feel like it's impossible for anyone to do anything because there's such a hunger it's so refreshing yeah i think everybody agrees that freedom of speech is a good thing oh i don't i don't well okay sorry sorry i don't agree the the the majority of people even at the universities that there's a hunger but it's almost like this kind of nervousness around it because there's a small number of loud voices yeah that are doing the shouting so i mean i again that's the where great leadership comes in and so you know presidents of university should probably be making clear declarations of like this is not this is a place where we value the freedom of expression when and this was this all throughout my career a president a university president who puts puts their foot down early and says nope you know we are not entertaining firing this professor we are not expelling this student it ends the issue often very fast although sometimes and this is where you can really tell the administrative involvement students will do things like take over the president's office and then that takeover will be catered by the university people will point this out sometimes as being kind of like oh it was clearly like my my friend sam abrams when they tried to get tried to get him fired at at at sarah lawrence college and that was one of the times that that it was used as kind of like oh that was hostile to the university because they the students took over the president's office and i'm like no they let them take over the president's office and i don't know if that was one of the cases in which the the takeover was catered but if there was ever sort of like a sign that's kinda like yes this isn't this is actually really quite friendly well in some sense like protesting and having really strong opinions even like ridiculous crazy wild opinions is a good thing it's just it shouldn't lead to actual firing or deplatforming of people like it's good to protest it's just not good to for a university to support that and take action based on it and this is one of one of those like tensions in in in first amendment that actually i think has a pretty easy release essentially you have app you absolutely have the right to devote your life to ending freedom of speech and ridiculing it as a concept and and there are people who who really are can come off as very contemptible about even the philosophy of freedom of speech and we will defend your right to do that we will also disagree with you and if you try to get a professor fired we will be on the other side of that now i think you had randy kennedy who i really i love him i think i think he's a great guy but he's he criticized us for our deplatforming database as saying this is saying that that students can't protest speakers i'm like okay that's silly we fire as an organization have defended the right to protest all the time we are constantly defending the rights of the the rights to protesters not believing that the protesters have the right to say this would like basically the that would be punishing the speakers we're not calling for punishing the the protesters but what we are saying is you can't let the protesters win if they're demanding someone be fired for their freedom of speech so the line there is between protesters protesting and the university taking action based on the protest yeah exactly and of course shout downs that that's just mob censorship and that's something where the university the way that the way you you deal with that tension in first amendment law is essentially kind of like the one positive duty that the government has the the first the negative duty the thing that it's not allowed to do is censor you mhmm but its positive duty is that if if i want to say awful things or for that matter great things that aren't popular in a public park you can't let the crowd just shout me down you can't allow what what's called a heckler's veto heckler's veto that's so interesting because i feel like that comes into play on social media somehow because you know there's this whole discussion about censorship and freedom of speech but to me the the carrot question is almost more interesting once the freedom of speech is established is how do you incentivize high quality debate and disagreement i'm thinking a lot about that and that's one of the things we talk about in canceling the american mind is arguing towards truth and that cancel culture is cruel it's merciless it's anti intellectual but it also will never get you anywhere near truth and you are going to waste so much time destroying your opponents in in something that can actually never get you to truth through the process of course of you never actually get directly at truth you just chip away at falsity yeah but everybody having a megaphone on the internet with anonymity it seems like it's better than censorship but it feels like there's incentives on top of that you can construct to yeah to incentivize better discourse yeah it's like to incentivize somebody who puts a huge amount of effort to make even the most ridiculous arguments but basically ones that don't include any of the things you highlight in terms of all the rhetorical tricks yeah to shut down conversations just make really good arguments for whatever it doesn't matter if it's communism for fascism whatever the heck you wanna say yeah but do it with scale with historical context with with steel manning the other side all those kind of elements we try to make three major points in the book one is just simply cancel culture is real it's a it's a historic era and it's on a historic scale the second one is you should think of cancel culture as part of a rhetorical as a larger lazy rhetorical approach to what what what we refer to as winning arguments without winning arguments and we mean that in two senses without having winning arguments or without have actually having won arguments and we talk about all the different what we call rhetorical fortresses that both the left and the right have that prevent you from that allow you to just dismiss the person or dodge the argument without actually ever getting to the substance of the argument third part is just you know how how do we fix it but the rhetorical fortress stuff is actually something i've been i'm very passionate about because it it it interferes with our ability to get at truth and it wastes time and and frankly it also kinda since cancel culture is part of that rhetorical tactic it can also ruin lives it would actually be really fun to talk about this particular aspect of the book and i highly recommend if you're listening to this go preorder the book now when does it come out october seventeenth okay the canceling of the american mind okay so in in the book you also have a list of cheap rhetorical tactics that both the left and the right use and then you have a list of tactics that the left uses and the right uses yep so there's the rhetorical the perfect rhetorical fortress that the left uses and the efficient rhetorical fortress that the right uses yeah first one is what aboutism yeah maybe we can go through a few of them that capture your heart in this particular moment as we talk about it and if if you can describe examples of it or if there's aspects of it that you see there especially effective effective so what about asm is defending against criticism of your side by bringing up the other side's alleged wrongdoing i wanna make little cards of these of all of these tactics and start using them on x all the time because they are so commonly deployed and what about ism i put first for a reason you know it'd be an interesting idea to actually integrate that into twitter slash x where people you know instead of clicking heart uh-huh they can click which of the which of the rhetorical tactics this is and then because you know there's actually community notes i don't know if you've seen on x there you people can contribute notes and it's quite fascinating it's it works really really well but to give it a little more structure yeah that's a really interesting method actually yeah i i actually when i was thinking about ways x could be used to argue towards truth i wouldn't wanna have it so that you know everybody would be bound to that but i think that it i i imagine it almost being like a stream within x that was truth focused that that agrees to some additional rules on how they would argue man i would love that where like there's in terms of streams that intersect and could be separated the shit talking one where people just enjoy talking shit okay go for it man and then there's like truth and then i mean there like then there's humor then there's like good vibes like you know i'm not like somebody who absolutely needs good vibes all the time but sometimes it's nice to have it's nice to just log in and not have to see like the drama the fighting the bickering the the cancellations the moms all of this it's good to just see that's why i go to reddit r awe or like one of the cute animals ones where where there's cute puppies and kittens and it's like i just wanna see ryan reynolds singing with will ferrell i mean like sometimes it's all you i need that in my heart yeah not all the time just a little bit and then right back to the the battle for truth okay so what about ism what about ism yeah that's everywhere when when you look at it when you look at twitter when you look at social media in general and the first like what we call the obstacle course is basically time tested old fashioned you know argumentative dodges that everybody uses and what aboutism is just bringing up something you know like someone makes an argument like biden is corrupt and and then someone says well trump was worse you know like and that's not an illegitimate you know argument to make back but it does it it seems to happen every time someone makes an assertion someone just points out some other thing that was going on and it can get increasingly attenuated from from from what you're actually trying to argue and when you and the you see this all the time on social media and it's kind of you know i was a big fan of jon stewart's daily show but an awful lot of what the humor was and what the tactic was for arguing was this thing over here it's like oh i'm making this argument about this important problem oh actually you know there there there's this other problem over here that i'm more concerned about and it it it you know and on the you know let's let's pick on the right here so january sixth you know watching everybody arguing about chop you know like the the the occupied part of seattle or the occupied part of portland and so and basically trying to like oh you're bringing up the the the riot on january sixth and by the way i live on capitol hill so believe me i was very aware of like how scary and bad it was you know like i i just my dad grew up in yugoslavia and that was a night where we all ate dinner in the basement because i'm like oh when the shit goes down eat in the basement it was it was it was genuinely scary and people would would try to deflect from january sixth being serious by actually be making the argument that oh well there are crazy horrible things happening in all over the country you know riots that came from some of the social justice protests and of course the answer is you can be concerned about both of these things and and find them both problems but you know if i'm arguing about chop you know someone bringing up january sixth isn't super relevant to it or if i'm arguing about january sixth someone bringing up the riots in twenty twenty isn't that helpful we took a long dark journey from what aboutism yeah and related to that is straw manning and and steel manning so misrepresenting the the the the the perspective of the the the opposing perspective and this is something also i i guess is very prevalent and it's difficult to do the the reverse of that which is steel manning it requires empathy it requires eloquence it requires understanding actually doing the research and understanding the the the alternative perspective my wonderful employee angel enduardo has something that he calls star manning and i and i find myself do doing this a lot it's it's nice to have you know two immigrant parents because i remember being in san francisco in a in the weird kind of like aclu slash burning man kind of cohort and having a friend there who was an artist who would talk about hating kansas and that was his metaphor for middle america is what he meant by it and but he was kind of proud of the fact that he hated kansas and i'm like you gotta understand i still see all of you a little bit as foreigners and think about like change the name of kansas to croatia you know change change the name of kansas to to to some that's what it sounds like to me and the starmanding idea which i which i like is is the idea being like so you're saying that you really hate your dominant religious minority like and that's when you start actually detaching yourself a little bit from it how typical america is exceptional in a number of ways but some of our dynamics are incredibly typical it's one of the reasons why like when people start reading thomas sowell for example they start getting hooked because one of the things he does is he does comparative analysis of country's problems and points out that some of these things that we think are just unique to the united states exist in you know seventy five percent of the rest of the countries in the world francis fukuyama's the the book that i'm reading right now origins of the political order actually does this wonderful job of pointing out how we're not special in a variety of ways this is actually something that's very much on my mind and fukuyama of course it's a it's a it's a great book it's not it's stilted a little bit in its writing because his term for one of the things he's concerned about what destroys societies is repatrimonialization mhmm which is the reversion to societies in which you favor your family and friends and i actually think a lot of what i'm seeing in sort of in the united states it makes me worried that we might be going through a little bit of a process of repatriation and i think that's one of the reasons why people are so angry i i think having an i think the the prospect that we you know we very we very nearly seem to have an election that was gonna be you know jeb bush versus hillary clinton it's like are we a dynastic country now is is that what's kind of happening but also it's one of the reasons why people are getting so angry about the about legacy admissions about like how much you know certain families seem to be able to keep their people in the upper classes of the united states perpetually and believe me like i i was poor when i was a kid and i went and i got to go to i got to go to one of the fancies i got to go to stanford and i got to see how people they treat you differently in a way that's almost insulting like basically like suddenly to a certain kind of person i was a legitimate person and i look at how much america relies on harvard on yale to produce its i'm gonna use a very marxist sounding term ruling class and that's one of the reasons why you have to be particularly worried about what goes on at at these elite colleges and these elite colleges with the exception of university of chicago and and and uva do really badly regarding freedom of speech and that has all sorts of problems it doesn't bode well for the future of the protection of freedom of speech for the rest of the society so can you also empathize there with the folks who voted for donald trump because as precisely that as a resistance to this kind of momentum of the ruling class this this royalty that passes on the the rule from generation to generation i try really hard to empathize with to a degree everybody and and and try to really see where they're coming from and the anger on the right i get it i mean like i i i feel like the the book so copying the american mind was a book that i that could be sort of a crowd pleaser to a degree partially because we really meant what we said in the subtitle that these are good intentions and bad ideas that are hurting people and if you understand it and read the book you can say it's like okay this isn't anybody being malicious you know this is people trying to protect their kids they're just doing it in a way that actually can actually lead to greater anxiety depression and strangely eventually pose a threat to freedom of speech but in this one we can't be quite me and my oh i haven't even mentioned my brilliant co author ricky schlott a twenty three year old genius she's she's she's amazing i started working with her when she was twenty who's who's my coauthor on this book so when i'm saying we i'm talking about me and ricky she's a libertarian libertarian journalist and a journalist yeah brilliant mind yeah and but we can't actually write this in a way that's too kind because cancellers aren't kind there's a cruelty and a mercilessness about it i mean i started getting really depressed this past year when i was writing it and i didn't even want to tell my staff why i was getting so anxious and depressed it's partially because i'm talking about people who will you know in some of the cases we're talking about like go to your house target your kids so so that's a long winded way of saying the i i kinda can get what sort of drives the right nuts to a degree in this i feel like they're constantly feeling like they're being gaslit elite education is really insulting to the working class like it part of the ideology that is dominant right now kind of treats almost seventy percent of the american public like they're we talked we developed this a little bit in the perfect rhetorical fortress like they're to some some way illegitimate and not worthy of respect or compassion yeah the the general elitism that radiates self fueling elitism that radiates from the people that go to these institutions and what's funny is the the the elitism has been repackaged as a kind of it masquerades as kind of infinite compassion that essentially it's based in a sort of a very to be frank overly simple ideology and over simply simple explanation of the world breaking people into groups and judging people on how oppressed they are on their on the intersection of their various identities and it came to that i think initially with with an appeal from a compassionate core but it gets used in a way that is can be very cruel very dismissive compassion less and allows you to not take seriously most of your fellow human beings it's really weird how that happened maybe you can explore why a thing that has kinda sounds good at first yeah can be can creates can become such a cruel weapon of canceling and hurting people and ignoring people i mean this is what you describe with the perfect rhetorical fortress yeah which is a set of questions maybe you can elaborate on what the perfect rhetorical fortresses yeah so the perfect rhetorical fortress is the way that's been developed on the left to not ever get to someone's actual argument i i wanna make a chart like a flowchart of this about like here's the argument and here is this perfect fortress that will deflect you every time from getting to the argument and i started to notice this certainly when i when i was in law school that there were lots of different ways you could dismiss people and perfect rhetorical fortress step one and i can attest to this because i was guilty of this as well that you can dismiss people if you can argue that they're conservative they don't have to be conservative to be clear you just have to say that they are so i never read thomas sowell because he was a right winger yeah i didn't read camille paglia because i was i had someone who convinced me she was a right winger there there were lots of authors that and when i was in law school it among a lot of very bright people it really was already an intellectual habit that if you could designate something conservative then you didn't really have to think about it very much anymore or take it particularly seriously that's a childish way of arguing mhmm but nonetheless i engaged in it it was a common tactic i i even mentioned in the book there was a time when a a a gay activist friend who was i think decided to leave to my left but nonetheless had that pragmatic experience of actually being an activist said something like well just because someone's conservative doesn't mean they're wrong and i remember feeling kind of scandalized at at at some level of just being like well that's kinda isn't that the whole thing what we're saying is that they're just kinda bad people with bad ideas you can just throw oh that guy's a right winger you can just throw that boop don't have to think about you anymore yeah and then it can if you're popular enough it can be those it can be kinda sticky yeah like and it's weird because because it's effective that's why it keeps on getting used essentially it it should have hit someone's because because i you know i have a great liberal pedigree you know everything from working at the aclu to doing refugee law in eastern europe to i was part of an environmental mentoring program for inner city high school kids in dc you know i've been i've been i i i i can you know defend myself as being on the left but i hate doing that mhmm because there's also part of me that's like okay so what like are you really saying that if you can magically make me argue or convince yourself that that i'm on the right that you don't have to listen to me anymore and again that's arguing like children and the reason why this has become so popular is because even among or maybe maybe especially among elites that it works so effectively as a perfect weapon that you can use uncritically if i can just prove you're on the right i don't have to i don't have to think about you it's no wonder that suddenly you start see seeing people calling the aclu right wing and calling the new york times right wing because it's been such an effective way to delegitimize people as thinkers we've you know stephen pinker who who's on our on our board of advisors he refers to academia as being the left pole that essentially it's it's a position that from from that point of view everything looks to its right it looks as if it's on the right but once it becomes a a tactic that we accept it it will and that's one of the reasons why i you know i'm i'm i'm more on the left i'm but i i think i'm left of center liberal ricky is you know more conservative libertarian and initially i was kinda like should i be really be writing something with with with someone who's more on the right and i'm like absolutely i should be i i have to actually live up to what i believe on this stuff because it's ridiculous that we have this primitive idea that you can dismiss someone as soon as you claim mhmm rightly or wrongly that they're on the right well i feel correct me if i'm wrong but i i feel like you were recently called right wing fire and maybe you by association because of that debate oh the la times the la times oh fun let's talk about the la times so yes there's an article there's a debate i can't wait to watch it because i don't think it's available yet to watch on video you have to attend in person i can't wait to see it but fire was in part supporting and then la times wrote a scathing article about that everybody in the debate was basically right leaning right okay so much to unpack there you know barry weiss has this you know great great project the free press i've been very impressed it it's covering stories that the that a lot of the media right or left isn't willing to cover and we did a we hosted a debate with her and we we wanted to make it as fun and controversial as possible so fire and the the free press hosted a debate did the sexual revolution fail so the debate was really exciting really fun the side that said the sexual revolution wasn't a failure that that that grimes and sarah hader were on one it it was you know a a nice meaty thoughtful night and we got a rev there was a review of it that was just sort of scathing about the whole thing and it included a line saying that fire which claims to believe in free speech but only defends viewpoints it agrees with i can't believe that even made it into the magazine because it's not just calling us because of course you know the implication of course is that we're right wing which we're not actually the staff leans decidedly more to the left and the to the right but we also defend people all over the spectrum all the time like that's something that that even the most minimal google search would have solved so like we've been give giving la times some heat on this because it's like yeah if you said in my opinion they're right wing we would have argued back you know saying well here here here's the following fifty thousand examples of of of us not being but when you actually make the factual claim that we only defend opinions we agree with first of all there's no way for us to agree with opinions because we actually have a politically diverse staff who won't even agree on which opinions are good and what opinions we have but yeah i i i had a at one time when someone did something like this and they were just being a little bit flippant about kind of like free speech being fine i did a seventy tweet long thread you know just being like hey do you really think this is fine i decided not to do that on this particular one but the nice thing about it is it demonstrated two parts of the book mhmm canceling of the american mind if not more one of them is dismissing someone because they're conservative and because that was the implication don't have to listen to fire because they're conservative but the other one is something a termite that i that i invented specifically for the way people argue on twitter which is hypocrisy projection mhmm hi i'm a person who only cares about one side of the political fence and i think everyone else is a hypocrite mhmm and by the way i haven't done any actual research on this but i assume everyone else is a hypocrite and you see this happen all the time the the and this happens to fire a lot where someone would be where is fire on this case and we're like we are literally quoted in the link you just sent but didn't actually read or it's like where is fire on this it's like here's here's our lawsuit about it from six months ago so it it's a favorite thing and also jon stewart daily show like the the the the the whataboutism and the kind of like idea that these people must be hypocrites is something that great is comedy but as far as actually a rhetorical tactic that will get you to truth just assuming that your opponent or just accusing your opponent of always being a hypocrite is not a good tactic for truth but by the way it tends to always come from people who aren't actually consistent on free speech themselves so that hence the projection but basically not doing the research about whether the person is or isn't a hypocrite and assuming others or a large fraction of others reading it will also not do the research and therefore this kind of statement becomes a kind of truthiness without a grounding in actual reality yeah it breaks down that barrier between what is and isn't true because if if the mob says something is true it's it takes too much effort to correct it and there are three ways i want like you know i wanna respond to this which is just giving example after example of of times where we defended people on both sides of every major basically every major issue whether it's israel palestine whether it's terrorism whether it's gay marriage we have been abortion we have defended both sides of that argument the the other part and i call these the orphans of the culture war i really want to urge the media to start caring about free speech cases that actually don't have a political valence that are actually just about good old fashioned exercise of power against the little guy or little girl or little group on campus or off campus for that matter because these cases happen a lot of our litigation are just little people just regular people being told that they can't protest that they can't hold signs and then the last part of the argument that i want people to really get is like yeah and by the way right wingers get in trouble too and there are attacks from the left and you should take those seriously too you should care when republicans get in trouble you should care when california has a dei program that requires this on california community colleges has a dei program policy that actually requires even chemistry professors to work in different dei ideas from intersectionality to anti racism into their classroom into their syllabus etcetera this is a gross violation of academic freedom it it it it is as bad as it is to tell professors what they can't say like we fought and defeated in in florida it's even worse to tell them what they must say that's downright totalitarian and we're suing against this and what i'm what i'm saying is that it when you're dismissing someone for just being on the other other side of the political fence you are also kind of claiming making a claim that none of these cases matter as well and i want people to care about censorship if we can't take that tangent briefly with dei yeah diversity equity and inclusion what is the good and what is the harm of such programs dei i know people who are dei consultants there's some actually i have a dear friend who i love very much who who does dei absolutely decent people what they want to do is create bonds of understanding friendship compassion among people who are different unfortunately the research on what a lot of actually does is oftentimes the opposite of that and i think that it's partially a problem with some of the ideology that comes from critical race theory which is a real thing by the way that that that informs a lot of dei that actually makes it something more likely to divide than unite we we talk about this in coddling the american mind as the difference between common humanity identity politics and common enemy identity politics and i think that i know some of the people that i know who do dei they really want it to be common humanity identity politics but some of the actual ideological assumptions that are baked in can actually cause people to feel more alienated from each other now when i started at fire my first cases involved nine eleven and it was bad professors were getting targeted professors were losing their jobs for saying insensitive things about nineeleven and both from the right and the left actually in that case sometimes more a lot more from the right and it was really bad and about five professors lost their jobs that's bad five professors on a over a relatively short period of time being fired for a political opinion that's something that you know would get written up in any previous decades we're now evaluating like how many professors have been targeted for cancellation between twenty fourteen and middle of this year july of twenty twenty three we're in about well over a thousand attempts to get professors fired or punished usually driven by students and administrators often driven by professors unfortunately as well about two thirds of those result in the professor being punished in some way everything from you know having their article removed to suspension etcetera about one fifth of those result in professors being fired so i wanna give some context here the the red scare is generally considered to have been from nineteen forty seven to nineteen fifty seven it ended by the way in fifty seven when it finally became clear thanks to the first amendment that you couldn't actually fire people for their ideologies prior to that a lot of universities thought they could they were like this guy is a very doc doctrine communist you know they can't be just waited i'm i'm gonna fire them they thought they actually could do that and it was only fifty seven when the law was established so like right now these are happening in an environment where freedom of speech academic freedom are clearly protected at public colleges in in the united states and we're still seeing these kind of numbers during during the the red scare the the biggest study that was done of what was going on is i think this came out in like fifty five and the evaluation was that there was about sixty two professors fired for for for being communist and about ninety something professors fired for political views overall that usually is reported as being about one hundred so sixty ninety one hundred depending on how you look at it i think the number is actually higher but that's only because of hindsight like what i mean by hindsight is we can look back and we actually find there were more professors who who who who were fired at at as time reveals we're at a hundred and ninety professors fired and i still have to put up with people saying this isn't even happening and i'm like in the nine and a half years of cancel culture hundred ninety professors fired in the eleven years of of the red scare probably you know somewhere around one hundred maybe probably more it's the number's gonna keep going up but unlike during the red scare where people could clearly tell something was happening the craziest thing about cancel culture is i'm still dealing with people who are saying this isn't happening at all and it hasn't been subtle on campus and we know that's a wild undercount by the way because when we when we surveyed professors seventeen percent of them said that they had been threatened with threatened with investigation or actually investigated for what they taught said or or their research and one third of them said that they were told by administrators not to take on controversial research so like extrapolating that out that that's a huge number and the reason why you're not going to hear about a lot of these cases is because there are so many different conformity inducing mechanisms in the whole thing yeah and that's one of the reasons why the idea that you'd add something like a d like requiring a dei statement to be hired or to get into a school under the current environment is so completely nuts we have had a genuine crisis of academic freedom over the last you know particularly since twenty seventeen on campuses we have very low viewpoint diversity to begin with and under these circumstances administrators just start saying you know what the problem is we have too much head heterogeneous thought we have we're not homogeneous enough we we actually need you know we need another political litmus test which is nuts and that's what a dei statement effectively is because there's no way to actually fill out a dei statement without someone evaluating you on your politics it's it's crystal clear we even did an experiment on this nate honeycutt he got something like almost like three thousand professors to participate evaluating different kinds of dei statements and one was basically like the standard kind of identity politics intersectionality one one was about viewpoint diversity one was about religious diversity and one was about socioeconomic diversity as far as where my heart really is it's that we have too little socioeconomic diversity particularly in elite higher ed but also in education period so we'd the experiment was had large participation really interestingly set up and it tried to model the way a lot of these dei policies were actually implemented and one of the ways these have been implemented and and i think in some of the california schools is that administrators go through the dei statements before anyone else looks at them and then eliminates people off the top depending on how how they feel about their dei statements and the one on viewpoint diversity i think like half of the people who reviewed it would would eliminate it right out and i think it was basically the same for religious diversity it was slightly better like forty percent for socioeconomic diversity but that kills me like the idea that kind of like yeah that is the kind of diversity that i think we need a great deal more of in in higher education you can agree with them it's not hostile to the other kinds by the way but the idea that we need more people from the bottom you know of three quarters of american society like in higher education i think should be something we could all get around but the only one that really succeeded was the one that's that sprouted back exactly the kind of you know ideology that that they thought the the reviewers would like which is like okay there's no way this couldn't be a political litmus test we've proved that it's a political litmus test and still school after school is adding these to its application process to make schools still more ideologically homogeneous why does that have a negative effect is it because it enforces a kind of groupthink where people are afraid start becoming afraid to sort of think and speak freely liberally about whatever well one it selects for people who tend to be you know farther to the left in a situation where you already have people a situation where universities do lean decidedly that way but it also establishes essentially a set of sacred ideas that if you're being quizzed on whether you know what you've done to advance antiracism inter how you've been conscious of intersectionality it's unlikely that you'd actually get in if you said by the way i actually think these are dubious concepts i think they're thin i think they're philosophically not very defensible but basically like if if your position was i actually i actually reject these concepts as being over simple you're not you're not gonna get in and and and i think that i the person that i always think of that wasn't a right winger that would be like go to hell if you if you made him fill one of these things out it's feynman i feel like if you if you gave one of these things to richard feynman he'd be like he would tear it to pieces yeah and then not get the job yeah there there's some element of it that creates this hard to pin down fear so you said like the firing the thing i wanted to say is yeah firing a hundred people or two hundred people the point is even firing one person i've just seen it it can create this quiet ripple effect of fear oh of course that single firing of a faculty oh absolutely has a ripple effect across tens of thousands of people of educators of of who is hired what kind of conversations are being had what kind of textbooks are chosen what kind of self censorship and different flavors of that is happening it's hard to measure that yeah i i mean when you ask professors about you know are they intimidated under the current environment the the answer is yes and particularly conservative professors you know already you know reporting that they're you know afraid for their jobs in a lot of different cases you have a lot of good statistics in the book things like self censorship when provided with a definition of self censorship at least a quarter of students said they self censor fairly often or very often during conversations with other students with professors and during classroom discussions twenty five percent twenty seven percent and twenty eight percent respectively a quarter of students also said that they are more likely to self censor on campus now at the time they were surveyed than they were when they first started college so so college is kind of instilling this idea of of of censorship self censorship and back to the red scare comparison and this is one of the interesting things about the data as well is that that same study that i was talking about the most comprehensive study of the red scare there was polling about whether or not professors were self censoring due to the fear of the environment and nine percent of professors said that they were self censoring their research and what they were saying nine percent's really bad that's almost a tenth of professors saying that they were actually that their speech was chilled when we did this question for professors on our latest faculty survey when you factor together if they're we ask them are they self censoring in their research are they self censoring in class are they self censoring online etcetera it's ninety percent of professors so the the idea that we're actually in a in an environment that is historic in terms of like how scared people are actually of expressing controversial views i think that it's it's the reason why we're gonna actually be studying this in fifty years the same the the same way we study the red scare it's not the the idea that this isn't happening is will just be correctly viewed as insane so maybe we can just discuss the leaning the current leaning of academia towards the left which you describe in various different perspectives so one there's a voter registration ratio chart that you have by department which i think is interesting can you explain this chart and can you explain what it shows yeah when i started fire in two thousand one i didn't take the viewpoint diversity issue as seriously i thought it was just something that right wingers complained about but i really started to get what happens when you have a community with low with low viewpoint diversity and actually a lot of the research that i got most interested in was done in conjunction with the great cass sunstein who writes a lot about group polarization because as and the research on this is very strong that essentially when you have groups with political diversity and you can see this actually in judges for example it tends to produce you know reliably more moderate you know outcomes whereas groups that are that have low political diversity tend to sort of spiral spiral off in their own direction and when you have a super majority of people from just one political perspective that's a problem for the production of ideas it creates a situation where there are sacred ideas and when you look at some of the departments you know i i think the ask the estimate from the crimson is that harvard is has three percent conservatives but when you look at different departments there are elite departments that have literally no conservatives in them and i think that's that's an unhealthy intellectual environment the problem is definitely worse as you get more elite we definitely see more cases of lefty professors getting canceled at less elite schools it it it gets worse as you as as you get down from the the the elite schools that's where a lot of the one third of attempts to get professors punished that are successful you know do do come from the right and largely from off campus off campus sources and we spend a lot of time talking about that in in the book as well it's something that i do think is underappreciated but when it comes to the low low viewpoint diversity it it's you know it works out kind of like you'd expect to a degree you know economics is what four to one or something like that mhmm it's not as bad but then when you start getting into some of the humanities you know like there are departments that there are literally none is there a a good why to why did the university's university faculty administration move to the left yeah i don't love and this is an argument that you'll sometimes run into on the left just the argument that well people on the left are just smarter right right and it's like okay it's it's interesting because at least the research as of ten years ago was indicating that if you dig a little bit deeper into that a lot of the people who do consider themselves on the left tend to be a little bit more libertarian there's something that pinker you know wrote a fair amount about the idea that we're just smarter it it it it is not is not an an opinion i i i'm at least bit comfortable with i do think that that it that departments take on momentum when they become a place where you're like wow it would be really unpleasant for me to work in this department if i'm the token conservative and i think that takes on a life of its own there are also departments where a lot of the ideology is kind of explicitly leftist you look at education schools a lot of the a lot of the stuff that is actually left over from what is correctly called critical race theory is is present and you end up having that in a number of the departments and it would be very strange to be a in many departments a you know a conservative social worker professor i'm sure they exist but it there's a lot of pressure to shut up if you are so the process on the left of cancellation as you started to talk about with the perfect rhetorical fortress the the first step is dismiss a person if they're just if you can put a label of conservative on them you can dismiss them in that way what what other efficient or what other effective dismissal mechanisms are there we have a little bit of fun with with demographic numbers and i run this by height and i remember him being kind of like don't don't don't include the actual percentage i'm like no we need to include the actual percentages because people are really bad at estimating what what the demographics of the us actually looks like both the right and the left in different ways so we put it in the numbers and we talk about you know being dismissed for being white or being dismissed for being straight or being dismissed for being male and we and you can already dismiss people for being conservative and we so we we we give examples in the book of of these being used to dismiss people and oftentimes on topics not related to the fact that they are male or whether or not they're minority and then we get to i think it's like layer six and we're like surprise guess what you're down to point four percent of the population and none of it mattered because if you have the wrong opinion even if you're in that point four percent of the most intersectional person who ever lived and you have the wrong opinion you're a heretic and you actually probably will be hated even more and the most interesting part of the research we did for this was just asking every prominent black conservative and moderate that that that we knew personally have you been told that you're not really black for an opinion you had every single one of them was like oh yeah no and it's kinda funny because it's like oftentimes white lefties telling them that it's like oh do you consider yourself black john mcwhorter talked about having a reporter when he talked about when he showed that he dissented from some of what he described as kind of like woke racism in in his book woke ideas the reporter actually is like so do you consider yourself black he's like yeah what what he's like what are you crazy of course i do and coleman hughes had one of the best quotes on it he said i'm constantly being told that the most important thing to to the how legitimate my opinion is is whether whether or not i'm black but then when i have a dissenting opinion i get told i'm not really black so perfect like it there's there's there's no way to falsify this argument that one really that that investigation really really struck me so and you laid this out really nicely in the book that there is this process of saying are you conservative yes you can dis dismiss the person are are you white dismiss the person are you male you can dismiss the person there's these categories that make it easier for you to dismiss a person's ideas based on that and like you said you end up in that tiny percentage and you could still dismiss and it's not just dismiss we we talk about this from a from standpoint the way the limitations on you know reality and one of them is time and a lot of cancel culture as as as cultural norms as this way of as as as cultural norms as this way of winning arguments without winning arguments is about running out the clock because by the time you get down to the bottom of the of the or actually even to get a couple steps into the perfect coral fortress and you know where has the time gone you know like it it you're you're you you probably just give up trying you know trying to actually have the argument and you never get to the argument in the first place and all of these things are pretty sticky on social media social media practically invented the perfect rhetorical fortress so the each one of those stages has a virality to to it yeah so it could it could stick and then it can get people really excited it allows you to feel outrage and superiority yeah because of that at the scale of the virality allows you to never get to the actual discussion of the point so but you know it's not just the left it's the right sure also it's the efficient rhetorical fortress so there something to be proud of on the right it's more efficient yeah so you don't have to listen to liberals and anyone could be labeled a liberal if if they have a wrong opinion i've seen liberal and left and leftist all used as a in the same kind of way yeah but that's leftist nonsense got it you don't have to listen to experts yep even conservative experts if they have the wrong opinion you don't have to listen to journalists even conservative journalists if they have the wrong opinion and among the maga wing there's a fourth proposition there's a fourth provision you don't need to listen to anyone who isn't pro trump yeah and we call it efficient because it it eliminates a lot of people you probably should listen to at least sometimes you know like we we we point out sometimes like how cancel culture can interfere with faith and expertise so we we get kind of being a little suspicious of experts but at the same time if you follow that and you follow it mechanically and i definitely you know i think everybody in the us probably has some older uncle who exercises some of these it is a really efficient way to sort of so your to wall yourself off from the rest of the world and dismiss you know at least some people you really should be listening to the way you laid it out it made me realize that we just take up so much of our brainpower with these so much time with these things it's it's literally time we could be solving things and you get like you kind of exhaust yourself through this process of being outraged i know based on these labels and you never get to actually there's almost not enough time for empathy for like looking at a person thinking well maybe they're right because you're so busy categorizing them and it's just that same the fun at empathy and i mean what's so interesting about this is that so much societal energy seems to be spent on these nasty primal desires where essentially a lot of it is like please tell me who i'm allowed to hate where can i legitimately be cruel where can i actually exercise some aggression against somebody and it seems to sometimes be just finding new justifications for that and it's an understandable you know human failing that sometimes can be used to defend justice but again it will never get you anywhere near the truth one interesting case that you cover about expertise is with covid yeah so how did cancel culture come into play on the topic of covid yeah i think that covid was a big blow to people's faith and expertise and cancel culture played a big role in that i think one of the best examples of this is jennifer sey at levi's she is a lovely woman she was a vice president at levi's she talked about actually potentially to be the president of levi's jeans and she was a big advocate for kids and when they started shutting down the schools she started saying this is going to be a disaster this is going to hurt the poor and disadvantaged kids the most we we have to figure out a way to open the schools back up and that was such a heretical point of view the and the typical kind of cancel culture wave took over because he had all sorts of you know petitions for her to be fired and that she needed to apologize and all this kind of stuff and you know she was offered i think like an a million dollar severance which she wouldn't take because she wanted to tell the world what she thought about this and that she wanted to continue saying that she hadn't changed her mind that this was a disaster for young people and now that's kind of the conventional wisdom and the research is pretty it it is quite clear that this was devastating to to particularly disadvantaged youth like people understand this as as being okay i mean she was probably right but one of the one of the really sad aspects of cancel culture is people forget why you were canceled and they just know they hate you there's this lingering kind of like well i don't have to take them seriously anymore by by the way did you notice they happen to be right on something very important now one funny thing about freedom of speech freedom of speech wouldn't exist if you didn't also have the the the right to say things that were wrong because if you can't you know engage in ideophoria if you can't actually speculate you'll never actually get to something that's right in the first place but it's especially galling when people who were right were censored and you and and never actually get the credit that they deserve well this might be a good place to ask a little bit more about the freedom of speech and so you said that included in the freedom of speech is to say things that are wrong yep what is your perspective on hate speech hate speech is the best marketing campaign for censorship and it came from academia of the of the twentieth century and that when i talked about the anti free speech movement that was one of their first inventions there there was a lot of talk about critical race theory and and being against critical race theory and fire will sue if you say that people can't advocate for it or teach it or research it because you do absolutely have the right to to pursue it academically however every time someone mentions crt they should also say the very first project of the people who founded crt richard delgado mary matsuda etcetera was to go was to create this new category of unprotected speech called hate speech and to get it banned the person who enabled this drift of course was herbert marcuse in nineteen sixty five you know basically questioning whether or not free speech should be a sacred value on the left and he was on the losing side for a really long time the liberals you know the way i grew up that was basically being pro free speech was synonymous with being a liberal but that started to be etched away on campus and the way it was was with with the idea of hate speech that that essentially oh but you should we can designate particularly bad speech as not protected and and who's gonna enforce it who's gonna decide what hate speech actually is well it's usually overwhelmingly can only happen in an environment of really low viewpoint diversity because you have to actually agree on on what the most hateful and and wrong things are and there's a a bedrock principle it it's referred to this in in a in a great case about flag burning in in the first amendment that i think all the world could benefit from you can't ban speech just because it's offensive it's too subjective it basically it's one of the reasons why the these kind of codes have been more happily adopted in places like europe where they have a sense that there's like a modal german or a modal englishman and i think this is offensive and therefore i can say that this is wrong in a more multicultural in a genuinely more diverse country that's never actually had an honest thought that there is a single kind of american there there's never been like we had we had the idea of uncle sam but that was always kind of a joke boston always knew it wasn't richmond always knew it wasn't georgia always knew it wasn't you know alaska like we've always been a hodgepodge and we get in a society that diverse that you can't ban things simply because they're offensive and that's that's one of the reasons why hate speech is not an unprotected category of speech and i and i go further my theory on freedom of speech is slightly different than most other constitutional lawyers and i think that's partially because some of the ways some of these theories although a lot of them are really good are inadequate they're not expansive enough and i sometimes call my theory the pure informational theory or freedom of speech or sometimes when i wanna be fancy the lab and the looking glass theory and its most important tenet is that there is that if the goal is the project of human knowledge which is to know the world as it is you cannot know the world as it is without knowing what people really think and what people really think is an incredibly important fact to know so every time you're actually saying you can't say that you're actually depriving yourself of the knowledge of what people really think you're causing what timur kuran who's who's on our board of advisers calls preference falsification you end up with an inaccurate picture of the world which by the way in a lot of cases because there are activists who want to restrict more speech they actually tend to think that people are more prejudiced than they than they might be and actually these kind of restrictions there was a book called racial paranoia that came out in about fifteen years ago that was making the point that the imposition of some of these codes can sometimes make people think that the only thing holding you back from being a raging racist are these codes so it must be really really bad it can actually make all of these things worse and one which we talk about in the book one very real practical way it makes things worse is when you censor people it doesn't change their opinion it just encourages them to not share it with people who will get them in trouble so it leads them to talk to people who they already agree with and group polarization takes off so we have some interesting data in the book about how driving people off of twitter for example you know in twenty seventeen and then again i think in twenty twenty driving people to gab led to you know greater radicalization among those people it's a very predictable force sensory doesn't actually change people's minds and it pushes them in directions that actually by very you know solid research will actually make them more radicalized so yeah i think that the attempt to ban hate speech it doesn't really protect us from it but it gives the government such a vast weapon to use against us that we will regret giving them is there a way to sort of to look at extreme cases to test this idea out a little bit so if you look on campus yeah what's your view about allowing say white supremacists on campus to do to do speeches so kkk i think you should be able to study what people think and i think it's important that we actually do so i think that you know let's take for example qanon yeah qanon's wrong but where did it come from why did they think that what's the motivation who taught them it who came up with these ideas this is important to understand history that's important to understand modern american politics and so if you put your act if you put your scholar hat on and which you should be curious about kind of everyone about where they're coming from darrell davis who i'm sure you're familiar with part of his goal was just simply to get to know where people were coming from and in the process he actually deradicalized a number of klan's members when they actually realized that this black man who had befriended them actually was compassionate was a decent person they realized all their preconceptions were wrong so it can have a deradicalizing factor by the way but even when it doesn't it's still really important to know what the bad people in your society think honestly in some ways it's for for your own safety it's probably more important to know what the bad people in your society actually think i personally don't know what you think about that but i personally think that freedom of speech in cases like that like kkk and campus can do more harm in the short term but much more benefit in the long term because you can sometimes argue for like this is going to hurt yeah in the short term but i mean harvey said this is like consider the alternative yeah because you've just kinda made the case for like this potentially would be a good thing even in the short term and it often is i think especially in a stable society like ours with a strong middle class all these kinds of things where people have like the comforts to reason through things yeah but you know to me it's like even if it hurts in the short term even if it does create more hate in the short term the freedom of speech has this really beneficial thing which is it helps you move towards the truth the entirety of society towards a deeper more accurate understanding of life on earth of society of how people function of ethics of metaphysics of everything yeah and that in the long term is a huge benefit it gets rid of the nazis in the long term even if it adds to the number of nazis in the short term yeah well and meanwhile just for for and the reality check part of this is people always bring up what about the klan on campus i'm like they're never invited the the the the i i haven't seen a case where where they've been invited usually this the the klan argument gets thrown out when people are trying to excuse and that's why we shouted down ben shapiro right and that's why you can't have bill maher on campus that's why you know and and it's like okay you know and it's a it's a little bit of that whataboutism again about being like well that thing over there is terrible and therefore this comedian shouldn't come so i do have a question maybe by way of advice sure you know interviewing folks and seeing this like a like a podcast as a platform and deciding who to talk to or not that's something i have to come face to face with yeah on occasion my natural inclination before i started the podcast was i would talk to anyone and including people which i'm still interested in who are you know the current members of the kkk and to me there's a responsibility to do that with skill yeah and that responsibility has been weighing heavier and heavier on me because you realize how much skill it actually takes because you have to know to understand so much because i've i've come to understand that the devil is always going to be charismatic yeah the devil's not gonna look like the devil and so you have to realize you have to you can't always come to the table with a deep compassion for another human being you have to have you know like ninety percent compassion and and another ninety percent deep historical knowledge about the context of the battles around this particular issue yeah and that takes just a huge amount of effort but i i don't know if there's thoughts you have about this how to handle speech in a way without censoring bringing it to the surface but in a way that creates more love in the world i remember steve bannon got disinvited from the new yorker festival and jim carrey freaked out and all sorts of other people freaked out and he got disinvited from from the and and i got invited to speak on smirkonish about this and i was saying like listen you don't have people to your conference because you agree with them like that's we have to get out of this idea that that's because they were trying to make it sound like that's an endorsement of steve bannon like that's nonsense like if you actually look at the opinions of all the people who are there you can't possibly endorse all the opinions that all these other people who are gonna be there actually have and in the in the process of making that argument i got and and also of course my the the very classic it's very valuable to know what someone steve bannon thinks you should be curious about that and i remember someone arguing back saying well what would you want someone to interview a jihadi and i'm like because we're at the moment like it was the time when when isis was really in in going going for it and i was like would you not want to go to a talk where someone was trying to figure out what what makes some of these people tick because and but but that changes your framing that essentially it's like no it's curiosity it it it is the is the cure for a lot of this stuff and we need a great deal more curiosity and a lot less unwarranted certainty and there's a question of like how do you conduct such conversations and i feel deeply underqualified who do you think are especially good at that i feel like documentary filmmakers yeah usually do a much better job and the best job is usually done by biographers yeah so the more time you give to a particular conversation like really deep thought and historical context and studying the people how they think looking at all different perspectives looking at the psychology of the person yeah upbringing their parents their grandparents all of this the more time you spend with that the better the better the quality of the conversation is because you get to understand the get to really empathize with the person with the people he or she represents yeah and you get to see the common humanity all of this interviewers are often don't do that work yeah so like the best stuff i've seen is interviews that are part of a documentary yeah but even now documentaries are like there's a huge incentive to do as quickly as possible yeah there's not an incentive to really spend time with the person there's a great new documentary about floyd abrams that i really recommend we did a documentary about ira glasser called mighty ira which was my video team and my protege nico perino and chris mulvey and aaron reiss put it together and it just follows the life and times of of ira glasser the former head of the aclu nikhisa if if you could just linger on that that's a fascinating story oh yeah who's who's ira amazing ira he wasn't a lawyer he started working at the n nyclu the new york civil liberties union back in i think the sixties he was i think robert kennedy recommended that he that he go in that direction and he became the president of the aclu right at the time that they were suffering from defending the nazis at skokie and niko and aaron and chris put together this and they'd never done a documentary before and it came out so so well and it tells the story of the nazis in skokie it tells the story of the case around it it tells the story of the aclu at the time and what leader ira glasser was and what's one of the things that's so great is like when you get to see the nazis at skokie they come off like the idiots that you would expect them to there's there's a moment when the when the rally is not going very well and and the the leader gets flustered and it almost seems like he's gonna like shout out kind of like you're you're you're you're making this nazi rally into a mockery and so it showed how actually allowing the nazis to speak at at skokie kinda took the wind out of their sails like if they had they the whole movement like everybody just kind of it all kinda dissolved after that because they looked like racist fools that they were they were you know even blues brothers made joke you know jokes about them and it and it didn't turn into the disaster that people thought it was going to be just by letting them speak and ira glasser okay so he has this wonderful story about how jackie robinson joined the brooklyn dodgers and how there was a moment when it was seeing someone an african american as on theirliterally on their team and how that really got them excited about the cause of of racial equality and that became a big part of what his life was and i just think of that as such a great metaphor is expanding your circle and seeing more people as being quite literally on your team is the solution to so many of these problems and i worry that one of the things that is absolutely just a fact of life in america is like we do see each other more as enemy camps as opposed to people on the same team and that was actually something in the early days like me and will creeley the legal director of fire wrote about the forthcoming free speech challenges of everyone being on facebook and one thing that i was hoping was that as more people were exposing more of their lives had realized a lot of these things we knew intellectually like kids go to the bar and get drunk and do stupid things that that when we started seeing evidence of them doing stupid things that we might be shocked at first but then eventually get more sophisticated and be like well come on people are like that that never actually really seemed to happen that that that i don't think i think that there are plenty of things we know about human nature and we know about dumb things people say and we've we've made it into an environment where there's just someone out there be waiting to be kind of like oh oh remember that dumb thing you said we were fourteen well i'm gonna make sure that you don't get into the to your dream school because of that that's offense archaeology where that's not my term though it oh okay it's a great term it's a great term we steal from the best digging through someone's past comments to find a speech that hasn't aged well and that one's tactical like that that one isn't just someone not being empathetic they're like i'm gonna punish you for this or and that's one of the reason why i got depressed writing this book because you know it's it's already there's already people who don't love me because of coddling and the american mind usually based on a misunderstanding of what we actually said in coddling and the american mind but nonetheless but on this one you know like i'm calling out people for being very cruel in a lot of cases but put but one thing that was really scary about studying a lot of these cases is that once you have that target on your back what they're gonna try to cancel you for could be anything you know they might go back into your old your your old boats find something that you said in nineteen ninety five you know do do something where essentially it looks like it's this entire other thing but really what they're what's going on is they didn't like your opinion they didn't like your point of view on something and they're gonna find a find a way that from now on anytime your name comes up it's like oh remember this this thing i didn't like about them and it's again it's cruel it doesn't get you anywhere closer to the truth and but it is a little scary to stick your neck out okay in terms of solutions yeah i'm gonna ask you a few things so one parenting yeah five and seven year old so i'm sure you've figured it all out then oh god no from a free speech perspective yeah from a free speech culture perspective how to be a good parent yeah i think the first quality you should be cultivating in your children if you want to have a free speech culture is curiosity and an awareness of the vastness that will always be unknown and getting my kids excited about the idea that's like we're gonna spend our whole lives learning about stuff mhmm and it's vast and exciting and endless and will never make a big dent in it but the journey will be amazing but only fools think they know everything and sometimes dangerous fools at that so giving the sense of intellectual humility early on being also you know saying things that actually do sound kind of old fashioned like but i i say things to my kids like listen if you enjoy study and work both things that i very much enjoy i do for fun your life is going to feel great and it's going to feel easy so some of some you know some of those old fashioned virtues of things i try to preach counterintuitive stuff like outdoor time playing having time that are not intermediated experiences is really is really important and little things like i talk about in the book about when my kids are watching something that's scary and i'm not talking about like zombie movies you know i'm talking about like you know a cartoon that has kind of a scary moment and saying that they wanted to turn the tv off and i and i talked to them and i say listen i'm gonna sit next to you and we're gonna finish this show and i want you to tell me what you think of of of this afterwards and i sat next to my sons and by the end of it every single time i you know when i asked them was that as scary as you thought it was gonna be and they were like no daddy that was fine and i'm like that's one of the great lessons in life the fear that you don't go through becomes much bigger in your head than actually simply facing it that's one of the reasons why i'm fighting back against this culture i'd i'd love you know for all of our kids to be able to grow up in an environment where people give you grace and you know accept the fact that sometimes people are gonna say things that piss you off mhmm take seriously the possibility it might be wrong and and be curious well i'm i have hope that the thing you mentioned which is because so much of young people's stuff is on the internet that they're going to give each other a break because then everybody's cancel worthy generation z hates cancel culture the most and that's another reason why it's like people still claiming this is even happening it's kinda like no you actually can ask you know kids what they think of cancel culture and they hate it yeah well i kinda think of them as like the immune system that's like that's the culture waking up to like no this is not a good thing i i am glad though i mean i i i am one of those kids who you know is really glad that i was a little kid in the eighties and a and a teenager in the nineties because having everything potentially online it it's it's not a an upbringing i envy well i because you can also do the absolutest free speech i like leaning into it yeah where i hope for a future where a lot of our insecurities flaws everything's out there yeah and to be raw honest with it i think that leads to a better world because the flaws are beautiful i mean that's the flaws as the the basic ingredients of human connection robert wright he wrote a book on on on buddhism and i talked about trying to use social media from a from a buddhist perspective and like as if you're as if it's the collective unconscious meditating and seeing those little like angry bits that are trying to cancel you or get you to shut up and just kind of like letting them go the same way you're supposed to watch your thoughts kind of trail off i would love to see that like visualized what whatever the whatever the drama going on going on just seeing the sea of it of the collective consciousness just processing this and having a little like panic attack and just kinda like yep breathing it in look looking at the little sort of hateful angry voices kinda pop up and be like okay there you are and i'm still focused on on that thing because that is that that is one of the things is okay yeah actually this is probably late in the game to be to giving my my grand theory on on this stuff but never too late so so what i was studying in law school when i ran out of first amendment classes i decided to study censorship during the tudor dynasty because that's where we get our ideas of prior restraint that that come from the licensing of the printing press which was something that henry the eighth was the first to do where basically the idea was that if you can't print anything in england unless it's with these your majesty approved printers it will prevent heretical work and anti henry the eight stuff from coming out pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty efficient idea if nothing else and i always and so he he started getting angry at the printing press around fifteen twenty one and then passed something that required prints prints to be along with parliament in in fifteen thirty eight and i always think of that as kinda like where we are now because we have this we had the back then we had the original disruptive technology you know writing was probably really bad but the the next one which which was the printing press which was absolutely calamitous and i mean and i and i and i say calamitous on purpose because in the short term the witch hunts went up like crazy because the printing press allowed you to behave to get that manual on how to find witches that the religious wars went crazy it led to all sorts of distress misinformation nastiness and henry the eighth was trying to put the genie back in the bottle you know he was kinda like i i i can i can i i wanna use this for good like like i feel like it could it could be used but he was in an unavoidable period of epistemic anarchy there's nothing you can do to make the period after the printing press come came out to be a nondisruptive non crazy period other than like absolute totalitarianism and destroy all the print presses which simply was not possible in europe so i feel like that's kinda like where we are now that disruption came from adding i think you know several million people to the european conversation and then eventually the global conversation but eventually it became the best tool for disconfirmation for getting rid of falsity for spotting bad ideas and it's the benefits the long term benefits of the printing press are incalculably great and that's what gives me some optimism for where we are now with social media because we are in that unavoidably in our political period and i do worry that that there that there are attempts in states to pass things to try to put the genie back in the bottle like if we ban tiktok or we say that nobody under eighteen can be on the on the internet unless they have parental permission we're going at something that no amount of sort of top down is going to be able to fix it we have to culturally adapt to the fact of it in ways that make us wiser that actually and allow it potentially to be that wonderful engine for disconfirmation that we're nowhere near yet by the way but think about it additional millions of eyes on problems thanks to the printing press helped create the scientific revolution the enlightenment the discovery of ignorance we now have added billions of eyes and voices to solving problems and we're just we're using them for cat videos and canceling but that those are just the early days of the printing press exactly it all starts with the cats and the canceling i is there something about x about twitter which is perhaps the most energetic source of cats and counseling it seems like the collective unconscious of the species i mean like get it's one of these things where the tendency to want to see patterns in history sometimes can limit the actual batshit crazy experience of what history actually is because yes we we we have these nice comforting ideas that it's gonna be like last time we don't know it it it it it it it hasn't happened yet and i think how unusual twitter is because i think of it as like the because because people talk about you know writing and mass communications and as being expanding the size of our collective brain mhmm but now we're kind of looking at our collective brain in real time and it's filled just like our own brains with all sorts of like little crazy things that pop up and and and and appear like virtual particles kind of all over the place of of people you know reacting in real time to things there's never been anything even vaguely like it and it can be at its worst awful to see mhmm at its best sometimes seeing people like just getting euphoric over something going on and cracking absolutely brilliant immediate jokes you know at the same time it can be it can even be a a joyful experience i i i feel like and i live in a neighborhood now on x where i i mostly deal with people that i think are actually thoughtful even if i disagree with them and and it's not such a bad experience i occasionally run into those other sort of what i call neighborhoods on x where it's just all canceling all nastiness and it's always kind of an unpleasant visit to those places i'm not saying the whole thing needs to be like like my experience but i do think that the reason why people keep on coming back to it is it reveals raw aspects of humanity that sometimes we prefer to pretend don't exist yeah but also it's totally new like you said yeah like just the virality the speed the news travels the opinions travel the the battle over ideas travels battle of information too yeah of what is true and not lies travel the the old mark twain thing pretty fast on the thing yeah and then it changes your understanding of how to interpret information it can also stress you out to no end i remember to get off it sometimes yeah the stats are pretty bad on on mental health with with with young people and i'm definitely in the camp of people who think that social media is part of that i understand you know the debate but i'm pretty persuaded that one of the things that is hasn't been great for mental health i mean of people is is just constantly being exposed yeah absolutely i i think it's possible to create social media that makes a huge amount of money makes people happy to me like it's possible to align yeah the the incentives yeah so in terms of yeah making teenagers making every stage of life giving you long term fulfillment and happiness with your physical existence outside of the social media and on social media helping you grow as a human being helping challenge you just in the right amount and just the right amount of cat videos whatever gives this full rich human experience i think it's just a machine learning problem yeah it's like it's not easy interesting to create a feed so the easiest feed you could do is like maximize engagement yeah but that's just like a really dumb algorithm yeah it's like for the for the algorithm to learn enough about you to understand what will make you truly happy as a human being to grow long term that's just a very difficult problem to solve you ever watch fleabag it's absolutely brilliant british show and it sets you up one of the reasons why like people love it so much is it sets you up that you're watching like a a raunchy british sex and the city except the main character is the the most promiscuous one mhmm it's like okay and you kind of roll your eyes a little bit it's kinda funny and it's kinda cute and what and kinda spicy and then you realize that the person is actually kinda suffering and having a hard time and it gets deeper and deeper as the show goes on and she will do these incredible speeches about tell me what to do like i just i know there's experts out there i know there's knowledge out there i know there's an optimal way to live my life so why can't someone just tell me what to do and it's this wonderfully like accurate i think aspect of human desire that what if something could actually tell me the optimal way to go because i think there is a desire to give up some amount of your own freedom and discretion in order to be told to do the optimally right thing but that path scares me to death yeah well see the way you phrased it that's it scares me too so there's several things like yeah one you could be constantly distracted in a tiktok way by things that keep you engaged yeah so removing that and giving you a bunch of options constantly and learning from long term what results in your actual long term happiness mhmm so like which amounts of challenging ideas are good for you mhmm that you know for for somebody like me that just four but there is a number like that for you yeah greg like that's a lot for me that number is pretty high i love debate i love i i love the feeling of like realizing holy shit i've been wrong yes but like you know and then i would love for the algorithm to know that about me and to help me but always giving me options if i want to descend into cat videos and so on well the educational aspect of it i do yes education yes like the the idea of kind of like both going the speed that you need to and running as fast as you can yeah you know i mean there's the you know the whole flow thing i just feel youtube recommendation for for better or worse if used correctly it feels like it does a pretty good job whenever i just refuse to click on stuff that's just dopamine based and click on only educational things yeah the recommendation it provides are really damn good so i feel like it's a solvable problem at least in this in the space of education of challenging yourself but also expanding your realm of knowledge and all this kind of stuff and and i'm definitely more in the we're in an inescapably in our field and it require big cultural adjustments and there's gonna there's no way that this isn't gonna be difficult transition is there any specific little or big things that you like to see x do twitter do i have lots of thoughts on that with the printing press an extra millions of eyes on any problem can tear down any institution any any person or any idea and that's good in some ways because a lot of medieval institutions needed to be torn down and some people did too and a lot of ideas needed to be torn down same thing is true now an extra billions of eyes on every problem can tear down any person idea or institution and some again some of those things needed to be torn down but it can't build yet we are not at the stage that it can build yet but it has shown us how thin our knowledge was it's one of the reasons why we're also aware of the replication crisis it's one of the reasons why we're also aware of how kind of shoddy our research is how much our expert class is arrogant in in many cases but people don't want to live in a world where they don't have people that they respect and they can look at and i think what's happening possibly now but will continue to happen is people are going to establish themselves as being high integrity that they will always be honest i think you are establishing yourself as someone who who is high integrity where the where they can trust that person a fire wants to be you know the institution that people can come to it's like if it's free speech we will defend it period and i think that people need new need to have authorities that they can actually trust and i think that if you actually had a stream that maybe people can watch in action but not flood with you know stupid cancel culture stuff or dumb cat memes where it is actually a serious discussion bounded around rules no perfect rhetorical fortress no efficient rhetorical fortress none of the bs ways we debate i think you could start to actually create something that could actually be a major improvement in the speed with which we come up with new better ideas and establish and and separate truth from falsity yeah if it's done well it can inspire a large number of people to become higher and higher integrity it it can create integrity as a value to strive for yeah and then like you know there's been projects throughout the internet that have done incredible job with that but have been also very flawed like wikipedia is an example of a big leap forward in doing that it's pretty damn impressive what what what's your overall take i i mean i i'm mostly impressed so there's a few really powerful ideas for the people who edit wikipedia one of which is each editor kind of for themselves declares you know i'm into politics and i really kinda am a left leaning guy so i really shouldn't be editing political articles because i have bias oh that's great they declare their biases and they often do a good job of actually declaring their biases but they'll still like they'll find a way to justify themselves like something will piss them off yeah and they wanna correct it because they they love correcting untruth into truth but the perspective of what is true or not is affected by their bias truth is hard to know and and and it it is true that there is a left leaning bias on the editors of wikipedia so for that what happens is on articles which i mostly appreciate that don't have a political aspect to them you know scientific articles or technical articles they're they can be really strong even history just describing the facts of history mhmm that don't have a subjective element strong also just using my own brain i can kinda filter out if it's you know if it's something about january sixth or something like this i know i'm going to be like i'm not whatever's going on here i'm gonna kinda read it but most i'm gonna look to other source i'm gonna look to a bunch of different perspectives on it it's going to be very tense there's probably going to be some kind of bias maybe some wording will be such which is one word this is where wikipedia does its thing the way they word stuff uh-huh will be biased the choice of words but the wikipedia editors themselves are so self reflective they literally have articles describing these very effects of how you can use words to inject bias yeah in in all the ways that you talk about it that's not healthier than most environments it's it's incredibly healthy but i think you could do better one of the big flaws of wikipedia to me that community notes on x does better is the accessibility of becoming an editor is it's difficult to become an editor mhmm and it's not as visible the process of editing so i would love like you said a stream yeah for everyone to be able to observe this debate between people with integrity yeah of when they discuss things like january sixth they're very controversial topics to just see how the process of the debate goes as opposed to being hidden in the shadows which it currently is in wikipedia you can access it it's just hard to access but and i've also seen how they will use certain articles like on certain people like articles about people i've learned to trust less and less yeah because they'll literally will use those to make personal attacks and this is something you write about they'll use descriptions of different controversies to paint a picture of a person that's that doesn't to me at least feel like an accurate representation of the person and it's like writing an article about einstein mentioning something about theory of relativity and then saying that he was a womanizer and abuser and a like controversy you know yeah he he is feynman also you know not you know was not you know they're not exactly the perfect human in terms of women but like there's other aspects to this human and to capture that human properly there's a certain way to do it i think wikipedia will often lean they really try to be self reflective and try to stop this but they will lean into the drama if it matches the bias yeah but again much better than the world i believe is much better because wikipedia exists but now that we're in these adolescent stages we're growing and trying to come up with different technologies the idea of a stream yeah is really really interesting as because you get more and more people into this discourse that where the value is let's try to get the truth yeah yeah and that basically you know you get the little cards for nope wrong nope wrong and the different the the different rhetorical techniques that are being used to avoid actually discussing yeah and i think actually you could make it a little bit fun by you get a limited number of them you you you know it's kinda like you you got three what aboutism cards so gamifying the whole thing absolutely yeah let me ask you about so you mentioned going through some difficult moments in your life sure what what has been your experience with with with depression what has been your experience getting out of it overcoming it yeah i mean the whole thing the whole journey through with the be with coddling the american mind began with me in the at the belmont psychiatric facility in philadelphia back in two thousand seven i had called nine one one in a moment of clarity because i'd gone to the the hardware store to to make sure that when i killed myself that i it stuck i wanted to make sure that i you know had my head wrapped and everything so like if all the drugs i was planning to take didn't work that i wouldn't be able to you know claw my way out it'd been a really rough year and i always had issues with depression but they were getting worse and frankly one of the reasons why this cancel culture stuff is so important to me is that the thing that i didn't emphasize as much in coddling the american mind which by the way that description that i give of trying to kill myself was the first time i'd ever written it down nobody in my family was aware of how of it being like that my wife had never seen it and basically the only way i was able to write that was by by doing you know how you can kinda trick yourself if and i was like i'm going to convince myself that this is just between me and my computer and nobody will see it mhmm it's probably not the most public thing i've ever written but what i didn't emphasize in that was how much the culture war played into how depressed i got because i was originally legal director of f i r e then then i became president of fire in two thousand five moved to philadelphia is where i get depressed and and just i don't have family there there's something about the town they don't seem to like me very much but the main thing was being in the culture world all the time there was a girl that i was dating i remember you know she didn't seem to really approve of what i did and a lot of people didn't really seem to and meanwhile like i was defending people on the left all the time and they'd be like oh that's good that you're defending someone on the left but they still would never forgive me for defending someone on the right and i remember saying at one point i'm like listen i'm like i'm a true believer in this stuff i'm willing to defend nazis i'm certainly willing to defend republicans and she actually said i think republicans might be worse and that didn't that really shouldn't go very well and then i nearly got in fist fights a couple times with people on the right because they found out i defended people who cracked jokes about nine eleven like this happened more than once i'm not you know by that time i'm i'm in my twenties i'm not fist fighting again but yeah it was always like that you you you see how hypocritical people can be you can see how friends can turn on you if they don't like your politics so i got a early preview of this of of of what the culture we were heading into by being the president of fire and it was exhausting and that was one of the main things that led me to be you know suicidally depressed at the belmont center if you told me that that would be the beginning of a new and better life for me i would have laughed if i could have but i would you know i don't i you can tell i'm okay if i'm still laughing and i wasn't laughing at that point so i got a doctor and i i started doing cognitive behavioral therapy i started having all these voices in my head that were catastrophizing and you know it gave an over overgeneralization and fortune telling you know mind reading all of these things that they teach you not to do and it and what they what you do in cbt is essentially you have something makes you upset and then you just write down what the thought was and you know something minor could happen and your response was you know like well the date didn't seem to go very well and that's because i'm broken and will die alone and you're like okay okay okay what what what are what are the following you know that's catastrophizing that's mind reading that's fortune telling that's all this stuff and you have to do this several times a day forever i actually need to brush up on it at the moment and it slowly over time voices in my head that have been saying horrible you know horrible internal talk it just didn't sound as convincing anymore which was a really kind of like subtle effect like it was just kind of like oh wait i don't buy that i'm broken you know like that doesn't sound true that doesn't sound like truth from god like like like it used to and nine months after i was planning to kill myself i was probably happier than i'd been in a decade and that was one of the things that you know that the cbt is what led me to notice this in my own work that it felt like administrators were kind of selling cognitive distortions but students weren't buying yet and then when i started noticing that they seemed to come in actually already believing in a lot of this stuff that it would be very dangerous and that led to codling the american mind and all that stuff but the thing that was rough about writing handling the american mind and i've mentioned this already a couple of times i got really depressed this past year because i was studying you know there there there's a friend in there that i talk about who killed himself after being canceled i talked to him a week before he killed himself and i hadn't actually i hadn't actually checked in with him because he seemed so confident i thought he would be totally fine because he he he had an insensitive tweet in june of twenty twenty and you know got got forced out in a way that didn't actually sound as bad as a lot of the other professors he actually at least got a severance package but they knew he'd sue and win because he had before and so i i waited to check-in on him because we were so overwhelmed with the request for help helps and he was saying people were coming to his house still and then he he shot himself the next week and i i definitely and because everyone know i'm so public about you know my struggles with this stuff everybody who fights this stuff comes to me when they're having a hard time and this is a very hard psychologically taxing business to be in and even admitting this right now like i think about like all the all the vultures out there they'll have fun with it just like the same way when when when my friend mike adams killed himself there were people like celebrating on twitter that that a man was dead because they didn't like his tweets and but somehow that made them compassionate for some abstract other person so i was getting a little depressed and anxious and the thing that really helped me more than anything else was confessing to my staff that i you know i i books take a lot of energy so i i knew they didn't wanna hear that not only was this taking a lot of the boss's time this was making him depressed and anxious but when i finally told my the leadership of my staff you know people that even though i try to maintain a lot of distance from i love very very much it made such a difference you know because i could be open about that and the other thing was have you heard this conference dialogue oh yes it's like an invite only thing mhmm it's orin hoffman runs it it intentionally tries to get people over the political spectrum to come together and have off the record conversations about big issues and it was nice to be in a room where liberal conservative none none of the above were all like oh thank god someone's taken on cancel culture mhmm and where it felt like it felt like maybe this won't be the the disaster for me and my family that i was that that i was starting to be afraid it would be that taking the stuff on might actually have a happy ending well one thing i just stands out from that is the the pain of cancellation can be really intense and that doesn't necessarily mean losing your job but just even you can call it bullying you can call it whatever name but just some number of people on the internet and that number can be small kind of saying bad things to you yeah that can be a pretty powerful force to the human psyche which is was very surprising and then the flip side also of that it really makes me sad how cruel people can be yeah it's an it's such a thinking that your cause is social justice in many cases can lead people to think i can be as cruel as i want in pursuit of this when a lot of times it's you know just a way to sort of vent some aggression on on a person that you think of only as an abstraction so i think it's important for people to realize that they're whatever like whatever whatever negative energy whatever negativity you want to put out there like there's real people that can get hurt yeah like you can really get people to one be the worst version of themselves or two possibly take their own life and it's not as real yeah well that that's one of the things that we do in the book to to really kind of address people who still try to claim this you know isn't real is we just quote you know we quote the pope we quote obama we quote james carville we quote taylor swift on cancel culture like and taylor swift's quote is is essentially about like how behind all of this there's when it gets particularly nasty there's this very clear you know kill yourself kind of undercurrent to it and it's it's cruel and the and the problem is that in an environment so wide open there's always going to be someone who wants to be so transgressive and say the most hurtful you know terrible thing but then you have to remember the misrepresentation getting back to the old idioms sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me has been reimagined in campus debates in the most asinine way people will literally say stuff like but now we know words can hurt and it's like now we know words can hurt guys you didn't have to come up with a special little thing that you teach children to make words hurt less if they never hurt in the first place it wouldn't even make sense the saying it's a saying that you repeat to yourself to give yourself strength when the bullies have noticed you're a little weird this might be a little personal the and it helps it really does help to be like listen okay assholes are gonna say asshole things and i can't let them have that kind of power over me yeah yeah it still is a learning experience because it does it does it does hurt but but for but for the good people out there who actually you know just sometimes think think that they're venting you know think think about it remember that there are people on the other side of it yeah for me it hurts my kind of faith in humanity i know it shouldn't but it does sometimes when i just see people being cruel to each other it kinda it's it floats a cloud over my perspective of the world that i don't i wish didn't have to be there yeah i that was always my sort of flippant but answer to the if if mankind is basically good or basically evil being like the biggest debate in in in in philosophy and being like well the problem with with the first is there's nothing basic about humanity yeah what gives you hope about this whole thing about about this dark state that we're in as you describe how can we get out what gives you hope that we will get out i think that people are sick of it i think people are sick of not being able to be authentic and that's really you know what censorship is it's basically telling you don't be yourself don't actually be say what you think don't show your personality don't dissent don't be weird don't be wrong and that's not sustainable i i think that people have kind of had enough of it but one thing i definitely wanna say to your audience is it can't just be up to us our viewers to try to fix this and i think that and this may sound like it's an unrelated problem i think if there were highly respected let's say extremely difficult ways to prove that you're extremely smart and hardworking that cost little or nothing that actually can give the harvards and the yales of the world a run for their money i think that might be the most positive thing we could do to to deal with a lot of these problems and why i think the fact that we have become a weird america with a great anti elitist tradition has become weirdly elitist in this in in the respect that we not only again are our leadership coming from these few fancy schools we actually have like great admiration for them we kind of look up to them but i think we'd have a lot healthier of a society if people could prove you know their excellence in ways that are coming from completely different streams and and that that are that are highly respected i sometimes talk about there should be a test that anyone who passes it gets like a you know a ba in the humanities that like a super ba like some something like someone not a ged that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about something that like you know one out of only a couple like a hundred people can pass some other way of actually of not going through these massive bloated expensive institutions that people can raise their hands and say i am smart and hardworking i think that could be an incredibly healthy way i think we need additional streams for creative people to be solving problems whether that's on x or someplace else i think that there's lots of things that technology could do to really help with this i think some of the stuff that sal khan is working on at khan academy could really help so i think there's a lot of ways but they exist largely around coming up with new ways of doing things not just expecting the old things that have say forty billion dollars in the bank that they're going to reform themselves and and here and here's my you know i've been picking on harvard a lot but i'm gonna pick on them a little bit more more the and one and and i talk a lot about class again and you know there's a great book called poison ivy by evan mandry which i recommend to everybody it's outrageous it sounds like me on a rant at stanford which was and i and i think the stat is you know elite higher education has more kids from the top one percent than they have from the bottom fifty or sixty percent depending on the school and when you look at how much they actually like replicate class privilege it's it's really distressing so everybody should read poison ivy and above all else if you're weird continue being weird yeah
