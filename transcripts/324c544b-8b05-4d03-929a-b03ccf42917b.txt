based editor they got multitrack sync to make sure everything is aligned and sync man that's a hellhole that you want technology to help you avoid and they do wonderfully the syncing of everything together it kinda makes me wanna do more remote podcast because for certain kinds of guests being there in person is not as essential as for certain others whenever there's chemistry and the dynamic kind of wit and banter and back and forth and the sort of the dance the music of conversation and so on that being in person is is really nice but when it's really intense and heated not necessarily in the argument there in the room but on the weight and the heaviness of the topic then sometimes being in the room is nice plus there's something that's difficult to describe that's not present with certain guests when it's remote but i think with others you can have a hell of a good conversation especially when you're doing like a debate or multiple people just getting them in the room together as i had to do for the israel palestine debate is really tough so i should probably do more remote conversations and i record my remote interviews with riverside give it a try at riverside dot f m and

friends here's talcy gabbert you've served in the us military for many years achieving rank of lieutenant colonel you were deployed in iraq in two thousand four and five kuwait in two thousand eight and nine what lessons about life and about country have you learned from that experience of war so many central to those lessons learned was having my eyes open to the very real cost of war you know of course i i served in a medical unit during that first deployment to iraq it was two thousand five during the height of that war and unfortunately we took a lot of casualties we across the entire us military my brigade that i deployed with was from the hawaii national guard we had approximately three thousand soldiers who were operating in in four different areas of iraq and my first task every day was to go through a list of every injury combat related injury that had occurred the day before in the country and i went through that list name by name looking to see if any one of our nearly three thousand soldiers from hawaii had been hurt in the line of duty and then if seeing them on the list tracking them down where were they were they getting the care they needed would they be able to get sufficient care to stay in country and then and return to duty did i need to get them evacuated usually it would be to military hospitals that at that time were in landstuhl and ramstein in germany and then from there getting them to either brook army medical center which is here in texas that specialized in burn related injuries or to walter reed and tracking them and their care until they were finally home with their families and it never became a routine task it never became like okay cool check the list you know kind of dot the i's cross the t's it it was that daily confrontation with the reality of the cost of war friends of mine were killed in combat experiencing firsthand that high human cost of war caused me you know twenty something year old from hawaii i'd had i'd left my seat in the state legislature to volunteer to deploy with my brothers and sisters in in my unit to iraq and so recognize the cost of war i think in two fundamental ways number one is the high human cost of war on our troops and on the people in the country where this war was being waged and also the cost on american taxpayers seeing then back as again two thousand five and recognizing kbr halliburton one of the biggest defense contracting companies then and i know that they are still very much in that business now dick cheney being connected with that company at one point or another but in our camp specifically which was one of the larger ones in iraq at that time there wasn't anything that happened in our camp that didn't have the kbr halliburton logo imprinted on it we had a big shack looking place where we ate our meals they call it a dining facility a dfac in the military and they served four meals a day they brought in and they being kbr kbr haliburton they imported workers in from places like nepal and sri lanka and the philippines to come in and cook food and work at this dining facility i got curious about how much how much it cost us as taxpayers and so i started asking around some of the people and i think at that time it was like well every time a soldier or a service member walks through the door if i were to go in for breakfast and grab a banana and walk out that's an automatic thirty five dollars per head per meal four times a day thousands and thousands of people and then we made friends you know there there's a lot there's a pretty large filipino community in hawaii a lot of filipino soldiers from hawaii we made friends with the filipino workers who were there they would often go in like the back of the tents and set up their own like rice cookers and cook their own meals which is where the real good food was but just started talking to them and and getting to know them and ask like hey how much do you get paid and on average it was like oh i get paid like five hundred bucks a month five hundred bucks a month to go and do this work of of either you know cleaning out porta potties picking up trash the dining facility doing laundry all of these different tasks because the military wanted soldiers to be out doing things that only soldiers could do mhmm understandable but when i started putting you know two and two together and knowing that this company one company alone was making trillions of dollars trillions of dollars and yet this filipino mom is making five hundred bucks a month maybe getting one day off a week maybe working twelve hours a day otherwise and so how you know how long how how often are you able to go home to your family well they let they let us go home a couple of weeks every other year it was it was an eye opening experience that growing up in hawaii i had i frankly hadn't given much thought to before but it's what led me ultimately coming back from that first deployment there was no way that i could go back to the life that i had left behind and i knew somehow someway i needed to find a way to use those experiences to try to make a positive impact to try to influence those i mean frankly the the politicians who were making decisions to go and launch these regime change wars and and send our men and women in uniform into war and and to what end ultimately if we can just go back to that list yeah so the list is just name and injury name and injury name unit potentially location if someone had documented that and and their injury and it's just pages and pages of that yeah yeah and and i knew you know i i didn't get to call home every day but when i called home and talked to my parents i felt the tension in their voice and you know they they didn't want me to worry about anything at home and so they were always like hey how are you what can we send you and this and that but you know it wasn't like i was calling them from down the street and saying hey how's it going let's let's go have lunch or whatever and so i knew that the reason for that tension was they were terrified of getting a phone call delivering the worst possible news and that was what i thought of as i went through that list of of how you know it is the reality of war behind every one of those names on that list was you know a husband or a wife parents you know sons and daughters family members who had no idea what we were dealing with really all they knew is what they saw on the news and what my dad told me later when i got home after that deployment was that every time they saw the news and they saw a helicopter shot down or crashed or some ied they they held their breath until they saw or heard the news of of who it was or or what it was what can you say about what the soldiers had to go through physically and psychologically when they get injured the physical you know i mean some some injuries appeared to be minor upfront at that time traumatic brain injury was not something that was talked about much if at all and so you know many had visible wounds others are now what we know were appeared like alright cool he checked out but had invisible wounds those who were injured in a way that did not allow them to get back to work found it emotionally very difficult to be put on a plane and evacuated out of there feeling guilty that they were leaving their friends behind and not thinking about themselves or not feeling bad for themselves but instead feeling bad for being forced to be in a position to leave you know for for soldiers it's not of course we all have our own political opinions on things but when it comes right down to it in a war zone it's about your friends it's about your brothers and sisters that you're serving alongside it's not about the politicians or whatever insanity is going on in washington it's about getting up and going out getting the job done and coming back home together i mean i i had friends of mine who were from hawaii who were from american samoa very culturally tight knit community who confided in me throughout that you know year that we were there some of the infantry soldiers who were going out on security patrols and and doing raids every day just some of the very traumatic experiences that they went through no physical injury but creating a kind of emotional stress and trauma that as human beings they were struggling in dealing with on a positive note you know i the polynesian culture especially but but also asian culture and other cultures around the world our guys found that as they were shortly after we got there the unit that we were replacing you know we're taking the guys out on patrol and saying hey here's this village here's where we found friendlies or here's where we know that there are insurgents operating and they've got allies and lookouts and you know showing them the lay of the land basically and what our guys found was that as they were doing these ride alongs they call it a left seat right seat when you're coming in and taking over that there was there was a bit of a a tense even adversarial type of relationship where on on the military side there was an assumption of suspicion or lack of trust just with the local local iraqi people who lived around the base that we were at and without anybody telling them to culturally our our guys began trying to build relationships and you know for hawaii and and samoa and we had soldiers from guam and saipan little things like you're riding down in a humvee you've got a gunner in the turret with a fifty cal or a machine gun of some sort little things like pointing the muzzle to the sky as you're riding through a town rather than pointing it directly at where people are walking down the street was a huge gesture of an assumption of hey let's let's let's actually talk and become friends we had our guys riding down the street and throwing chakras out to the to the local people there breaking bread sharing tea and building those relationships and and again i served in a medical unit and what we saw was a downward shift in in casualties from the unit that had been there before us simply because of that that basic human connection that our guys sought to make and then gradually finding like hey local you know people who lived in the in the town right next to us are saying hey you guys should really somebody was digging a big hole down this a mile down the road you might wanna bypass that or check that out and finding weapons caches and ieds improvised explosive devices and other things that helped save people's lives on the cost side of things how is it possible for a company like halliburton or others to get away with forty dollar bananas or however much it was with the overhead costs look what they will claim is that it's expensive to move logistics through a country at war but they get away with it ultimately these insane this insane war profiteering and they're not alone obviously there are other companies that this is their business model they get away with it because of their political connections and the lobbyists that they have the relationships they have with politicians and ultimately what president eisenhower warned against with that with regard to that cozy relationship between congress and even what he called then the military industrial complex it's been alive and well he warned us against it and i would say it's thriving more now than ever before how powerful is the military industrial comp complex is as a thing is it a is it a machine that can be slowed down can be stopped can be reversed it can be it's powerful i don't think you can overstate the powerful nature of it because it it extends so deeply within our government it it's not just those in these specific big defense contracting companies that benefit from it you look at the revolving door within the pentagon for example where you have both high ranking people who wear military uniforms as well as those who serve as high ranking department of defense civilians who are literally working their way into a big payout when they leave that job we see it with our own secretary of defense now he retired as a general officer went and served on one of the boards for one of the big defense contractors and then now back as the secretary of defense we see the same thing in congress with members of congress and senior professional staffers in congress same exact revolving door where you have people whether they're writing contracts for the department of defense for the company that then wins the bid for that contract and then going and working for that company or those in congress who are writing policies and doing exactly the same thing you have been both a war hawk and a war dove at times so what is your philosophy on when war is justified and when it is not war is justified when it is in the best interest of our national security and when it is the last resort when all diplomatic efforts have been completed and exhausted and war is the last possible route that must be taken to ensure the safety security and freedom of the american people so that's a high level beautiful ideal but there's messy details so terrorism for example yes the united states' involvement in the war in iraq and afghanistan was in part the big umbrella of the war on terrorism so you know when you decide whether something's justified or not and whether something could be defeated or not how hard is it is it even possible to what degree is it possible to defeat terrorism well first of all there's part part of the problem of our foreign policy has been how many conflicts wars military military actions have been waged in the name of this quote unquote war on terrorism in the name of national security legislation like the patriot act that violates civil liberties our civil liberties and freedoms in the name of the war on terrorism and national security when it's not justified and so i'll use afghanistan as an example i support the initial mission that lifted off shortly after the attack on nine eleven the islamist terrorist attack on nine eleven it was a relatively small group of us military launched to go after those al qaeda cells and osama bin laden in the wake of that attack that is the mission that should have been supported and focused on in its execution instead as you know it was attention was diverted very quickly to the regime change war in iraq that was waged on false pretenses and the resources and focus was taken away from that initial mission that went to afghanistan and the war in afghanistan blew up into something that became about regime change and governance and the taliban and less focus on al qaeda and osama bin laden and it became this thing that even general officers had a hard time articulating what is the objective here what are we trying to accomplish what does winning look like what at what point do we know it's time to exit and get out and if you as as you look at things like the you know the afghanistan files and others the answers to these simple and essential questions shifted and changed over time over a very long time similarly in in iraq you know the i i bought into a lot of what was being sold by the administration and time and very quickly even as i was on the ground there started to have my eyes opened up into how we had been how we had been lied to tremendously and how that protracted war went on for a very very long time with decisions being made that ultimately serve to strengthen terrorist groups like al qaeda the creation of isis and others really undermining our national security interest in the meantime understanding the enemy that you are trying to defeat is essential to being able to build a strategy the the declaration of president biden for example saying well the war on terror is over the war on terror is over what does that mean or the forever wars are over what does that actually mean i served i served on my last most recent deployment in twenty twenty one to east africa and somalia where al shabaab is one of those islamist terrorist groups that follows the same ideology as al qaeda isis hamas and others this group has been allowed to grow and be strengthened even though they are one of the main groups that provides funding to al qaeda in that entire region so any president or politician can declare a war to be over but when you have an enemy like these islamist terrorist groups who are still intent on their goal and their objective which is to ultimately establish their islamic caliphate and you know destroy israel and and exterminate the jewish people and and basically destroy kill or convert anyone who doesn't adhere to their ideology that continues on and it it they will only become stronger the longer our leaders put their heads in the sand and pretend like oh no this doesn't exist this kind of war this war specifically is one that has to be waged militarily and ideologically and the ideological component to this which is defeating their ideology with a superior one is one that i pointed out in congress during the obama administration we the collective we were failing at the obama administration was failing at because they were so afraid of being labeled islamophobes that they refused to accurately identify the ideology driving these terrorist groups and instead said oh we are countering violent extremism was the term that the obama administration started to use and was coined and and kind of mandated across the us government well you have to know again you have to know the enemy that threatens you and why they're doing what they're doing if you have any hope of actually preventing their attack both militarily and as we're seeing now with with hamas's actions not only directly in the assault on israel but how they hamas achieved their objectives in spreading their ideology around the world if you look at the lessons learned from the us involvement in afghanistan and and iraq how do you fight terrorism clearly understanding who they are and where they are and why they're doing what they're doing is essential first of all and obviously there are different groups different names they have morphed and changed based on their locale and how they operate building relationships with people in other countries both state leaders as well as religious leaders and others who share that same objective of defeating these islamist terrorists in on both fronts and and acting as a united front in taking that action what that what exactly that action looks like details on the ground dictate that details about these different groups will dictate that but we've seen examples of this before and i saw this in somalia we we saw it in some cases in iraq where for example you have imams who recognize the threat that these terrorist groups pose to their own people and their own communities and exerting their influence in defeating that the terrorist islamist ideology with their own teachings of islam and preaching peace amongst their people war is ugly and it is messy it is also an unfortunate reality of the world we live in so while i firmly believe that we must always pursue peace i'm not a pacifist i'm a realist and recognize that where there are these threats we must we must do what we can to work towards that that safety that security that freedom and peace that that we all want if we look at the perspective of israel in the israel gaza war going on now what do you do with the fact that the death of a civilian serves as a catalyst gives birth to hate potentially generational hate so in israel stated goal of destroying hamas they are creating immeasurable hate what do you do with that from a perspective of israel what is the correct action to take in response to october seventh it's a complex question with a complex answer i think israel's approach has to be in in recognizing that delineation as far as possible and i know it's tough when you have a terrorist group like hamas that is so interwoven within the community of people in gaza but to recognize that there there should be and there is a shared purpose there for the palestinian people to be able to live free and in peace and not under the oppression of this terrorist group just as the people of israel would like to live in peace and free from the threat of attack from a terrorist group that wants to exterminate them the complexities of what's going on in israeli politics is i think a different conversation but also one that is directly intertwined with the answer to this question when you have some people in the israeli government who don't want the palestinian people in gaza at all and want them to go and repatriate in other countries i think that's a big problem and that further exacerbates this hatred and resentment that continues to grow there this is a generations long challenge unfortunately of of the resentment and tension that exists between many israelis and many palestinians that can only be resolved when there's strong leadership representing both peoples who are are able and willing to come together and recognize that the only way forward is to let the past be in the past and find a way towards peace in the future how do you think how do you hope the war in ukraine will end the only way that this war ends is is to do exactly what we're talking about there has to be a brokered dialogue and conversation about peace that has to occur with representatives from from russia and ukraine it's it is really truly heartbreaking to see both how efforts that began just weeks after russia invaded ukraine to do exactly this were thwarted by the biden harris administration and other western powers has cost so many innocent people's lives and this is where i get i get i i have friends in ukraine i've been there more than a few times i've enjoyed and appreciated the time that i've i've spent there i i when i hear from my friends about how afraid they are of their husbands being conscript conscripted and you know feeling like they have to hide for fear of being yanked off the streets the the their friends and family members who've been killed in this war the only way this ends is when both sides come to the table and find an agreement that neither side is gonna be completely happy with both sides being forced to make some concessions but one where they will both walk away and and this war can end what's the role of the us president perhaps to bring everybody to the table do you think that the us president should sit down with zelensky and putin together yes yes in an ideal world yes this this should have happened long ago the question of whether or not president biden is the right person to do that at this time when all of the statements and comments that they have made the biden harris administration has made from the beginning of this war essentially point to their objective being to basically destroy russia and that's one of the reasons why they have supported both the continuation of this war for as long as it's lasted as well as why they have thwarted efforts towards peace whoever that most effective neutral broker is that that's the best person to do this the biden harris administration i think the the role that they have to take is actually encouraging zelensky to sit down and begin this process those kinds of engagements are the most to me the most powerful exercises of diplomacy that can't be matched especially when our our president's foremost role and responsibility is to serve as commander in chief and i wish that we had leaders who were more willing to engage because i think we'd we'd make a lot more progress more quickly and to to find areas both of mutual interest as well as to help deconflict and deescalate areas where there is tension or disagreement or adversarial interests so some of it is basic human camaraderie like people call me naive for this but sometimes just knowing that there's a human on the other side even like when it's in private if you look at zelensky and putin for example just humor both are very intelligent witty at times even funny people yes this is wartime yes a lot of civilians and soldiers are dying there's hate but if you can look above it all and think about the future of the countries the flourishing of a people and the stopping of the death of civilians and soldiers then in that place you can have that basic human connection i agree i don't think that's naive at all and i think there are so many examples through history that point to the power of that the real power in that in you know the cuban missile crisis how jfk had to literally find a secret way to communicate with khrushchev to try to go around the backs of the military commanders who were urging him to take military action and instead find hey we both ultimately want the same thing neither of us wants to launch a catastrophic nuclear war so let's figure this out of course there's examples throughout history you know leaders are complicated people they're manipulative people so you have like hitler and chamberlain meeting and yeah chamberlain kinda getting hoodwinked by hitler's charisma and being convinced that hitler doesn't have any interest in invading and destroying the rest of the world so you know you have to be smart don't be hoodwinked you've met you've been criticized for this you've met with syrian president bashar al assad and as part of the campaign you know running for president got criticized for not calling him a war criminal what's the right way to meet and communicate with these kinds of leaders we as as as i just stated we need leaders who have the courage to meet not just with allies but with adversaries in the pursuit of peace in the pursuit of increased understanding if policies are being made through the the lenses and the barriers of bureaucrats and the media and others who have or may have their own interests our president a leader can't make even members of congress can't make decisions with the kind of clarity that we the american people need them to make i think that these kinds of engagements are weaponized and politicized as they were against me by those who have their own interests whether it be the military industrial complex or in washington if you're not part of of the official narrative of the us government which was intent on a regime change war in syria then then you're an outcast and it it was it was it was unfortunate because you know people people levied all kinds of accusations and and you know smears against me for going and and having the audacity to go and and learn more try to seek the truth in the hopes of preventing more needless war and in the hopes of preventing yet another quagmire and disastrous war in the middle east and simply for going and yes meeting with assad also meeting with religious leaders in syria also meeting and talking with people on the streets in of of damascus talking with college students talking with people from the opposition party who who would like to see assad replaced you know talking with local law just a whole host of people over over the course of a few days you know the the accusation was of it like oh she's she loves dictators it's a sad state of affairs when our some of the most influential voices in our country will label someone a a lover or supporter of dictators simply because you're saying hey we shouldn't be going to war there is another way and and i'm not alone in this you know people who were against the war in iraq were late were were given similar labels until it became you know popular in our politics to have been against the iraq war we see the same thing now with people like tucker myself and others who are saying we should not be waging this proxy war against russia via ukraine and using the ukrainian people's lives in this war well now all of a sudden you're a putin lover a putin puppet or or whatever you know the traitor treason all all of these accusations that are used ultimately by people who are not interested in having a substantive conversation about the truth about looking at these these wars and conflicts you know with a comprehensive view on on exactly all the dynamics that are that are at play and then that's what i found when i came back i i went looking for went went to syria looking forward to coming back and shedding light on different perspectives experiences and stories that i found that would give people a a more broad understanding of of what was happening in that country and what i found was there was zero interest in the mainstream media or in congress in hearing any other perspective other than their own which was we need to launch this regime change war through the use of arming and equipping known terrorists within syria to overthrow the regime without any idea without them stating any realistic idea of who would take control once assad was overthrown but the reality actually being that no matter which opposition group they might try to prop up they would not have the power to withstand the terrorist groups whose stated goal it was to go and take over power from assad they had no interest in in trying to gain true understanding and it it was very disheartening it was very disheartening and and a a big lesson learned about where where their interests really were focused yeah it's a simplistic narrative template that's fit into every single situation a lot of stuff is not talked about in the russia ukraine war one of the things that's not talked about is okay so putin is overthrown then who do you think will come into power exactly the one of the things i talk about with aristoic is that putin and he gets criticized for this that putin out of all the people that might take power is the most liberal is the most dovish in fact every indication shows that he really hates this war and and so everybody that will step in if he steps down or if he is overthrown is just going to accelerate this this war and the expansionism and the the thirst for empire and all that kind of stuff that the the us military industrial complex will feed into so you have to think about what the future holds and what the different power players are and what the level of corruption there is and sort of the sort of the realistic view of the situation versus the idealistic view of the situation just on that note real quick i think that was exposed in broad daylight when it appeared that you know the the former head of the wagner group was about to try to to launch a coup and how that was so celebrated even on you know like msnbc and rachel maddow and others touting that this was somehow going to be a great thing without looking at you know who is this guy really what has he been doing in different countries around the world and what what would be his kind of ruling philosophy and how that would how that would differ or benefit american interests or the interest of security and peace but also the interest of ukraine or russia true humanity overall just the flourishing of nations which is great for everybody in collaborations with nations i agree friendly competition you know one of the things i love about the twentieth century is the friendly sometimes not so friendly competition between the soviet union and the united states in in space in the space race mhmm it's created some incredible engineering and scientific breakthroughs in all of this and also made people dream about like reaching out to the stars yeah war destroys all of that or damages it hopefully it just damages it hopefully it will the phoenix will rise again well let me ask you about the criticism you've mentioned of it's probably the most common criticism of you that you love putin so just to linger on it what's what do you think is the foundation of this criticism well i'll tell you when it began you know i had my first day in congress was january third twenty thirteen i believe it was the third fourth fifth somewhere around there and my last day was january third twenty twenty one i had been given my experience of of serving as a soldier in in the middle east and the motivation that that really drove me to run for congress in the first place i served on the foreign affairs committee and the armed services committee for almost eight years the eight years that i was there with my drive and motivation to to actually be in a position to challenge the influence of the military industrial complex to try to prevent us from needlessly going to war and so you know the likes of hillary clinton and the cabal of warmongers in washington they weren't fans of mine to say the least i can't say it was a total surprise but it was disheartening nonetheless that the very day that i announced my candidacy that i was running for president which was in february twenty nineteen as i the hour the the hour that i walked up onto that stage to announce my candidacy it was in hawaii and i gave my announcement speech nbc news published a hit piece that planted the seeds of suspicion in voters' minds that somehow i was a a darling of putin and russia and and whatever it was baseless all of it baseless and that that continued like a a steady drumbeat throughout my candidacy but that really was escalated when in a podcast with david axelrod hillary clinton said oh well the russians are grooming her and this is not i mean this this came from a very influential person yeah she was the former secretary of state former us senator former first lady someone who wielded and continues to wield a lot of power in the democratic party and amongst voters and that that took it to a whole new level what is the basis for this nothing it is it is a tired yet dependable playbook that is used not only by people like hillary clinton but also people like mitt romney and others to try to smear discredit and destroy the reputations of people who have the audacity to question their objectives as they call for one war or another or have the the audacity to say that this is not in the best interest of peace or in our country in our our national security they keep going back to this playbook as they do today because again they're not willing to debate the substance of one position versus another which is what we should have if people feel so strongly that we should be going and waging this war or that war okay great go make your case to the american people go stand on the floor of the united states house and actually have this debate allow those who are saying no this is not a good idea to also stand freely and make that argument instead they they resort to the kind of name calling that tells voters hey you can't trust this person or anything that they say we myself and some of my other colleagues got the same treatment when we tried to pass legislation in congress that would have taken out provisions from the patriot act that are most egregiously violating our fourth amendment rights and civil liberties authorities that have allowed our government to illegally surveil americans without a warrant and as we did so we're called traitors we were called we had other members of congress on the house floor saying that if you pass this legislation you will be responsible for another nine eleven style attack on our soil these are all distraction tactics to to try to divert our attention away from what's actually happening and instead just tell voters hey you can't you can't trust these people obviously this has happened to trump it's happened to bobby kennedy it's happened to people like rand paul and others there's a small group but a growing number at least among the republican side at this point people who are are actually willing to stand up and and challenge the military industrial complex challenge the warmongers in both parties well people on the left have challenged the the warmongers as well throughout the the the last few decades less so recently i agree with you but less so recently and this is one of the reasons why i left the democratic party one of the foremost reasons i i devote an entire chapter to this issue in my book for love of country leave the democrat party behind going into the the the detail of of some of the things we've talked about about my own experiences about what i have learned along the way but also how you know even in the last year two years certainly under this administration people who i worked with in congress who were democrats dependable voices for civil liberties dependable voices speaking out against the insanity of people who wanted to wage war for the sake of war they're largely silent now and unfortunately within the democratic party in washington there is no room for debate that if you challenge the biden administration's position on foreign policy you you're gonna get you're gonna hear about it and what we have seen is that that's exactly what's happened and people have retracted statements or just fallen silent or whatever the case may be this debate that should be existent within both parties on the democrat side unfortunately it just doesn't exist anymore there seems to be some kind of mass hysteria over the war in ukraine it was strange to to watch that the nuance aspect of the discussion was lost very quickly it was putin bad right it was a war between good and evil right and in that if you bring up any kind of nuanced discussion of like how do we actually achieve peace in this situation you're immediately put on the side of evil yeah which is pretty sick when you think about it i mean it's you know the cynical view is of course it's the the military industrial complex machine the the war profiteers just driving this kind of conversation much power i hope they just have incentives and they push people and they kinda use people's natural desire to divide the world into good and evil and fight for the side of good you know people just have a natural proclivity for that and that's a good thing that we wanna fight for the side of good but then that gets captured and manipulated yeah yes i admire your your hopefulness i am i am hopeful also because of the goodness in people and the naturally compassionate nature of people however i will tell you from firsthand experience that what we talk about is the national security state and the military industrial complex this cabal of warmongers that extends not only within government but outside of government extends to many powerful media outlets they are incredibly powerful and don't have any qualms at destroying those who try to get in the way of their power and they've got a lot of tools they've got a lot of tools to do that which i which i i think is why president eisenhower chose to include this in his farewell address as a warning because the only recourse the only real power that has the ability to destroy them and stand up against them is a free people living in a free society exercising the rights that we have enshrined in the constitution and bill of rights i just talked to annie jacobs and she wrote a book on nuclear war a scenario of how nuclear war will happen second by second minute by minute mhmm i apologize if it happens how it would happen is terrifying yeah it it's terrifying how easy it is to start that one person could start it first of all and then there's no way to stop it even potentially with tactical nuclear weapons that it would it just the the machinery of it how clueless everybody is combined with the machinery of it is just impossible to stop and it's just between rushing that the united states especially and then all of a sudden you have nuclear winter and five billion people are dead yeah and they they die through just essentially torture slowly how do we avoid that how do we avoid a nuclear war how do we that's something that you talk about and and think about how do we avoid this kind of escalation of a hot war i think the most essential thing first of all is understanding exactly what you have just detailed we are in this very strange and absurd time where we have talking heads and so called pundits on tv we have politicians we have people who are talking about a nuclear war as though it is a war that can be won period and a war that can be waged somehow without that risk of escalation to the point of destruction of human civilization and and so they talk about this as though it's just another war and especially as they talk about the use of tactical nuclear weapons oh well this is just this is small and we think it'll send a message without actually escalating to the point where we're dealing with with the kind of destruction that we witnessed in world war two that's a dangerous thing when it becomes like normalized as you know well we've got this new missile that'll go and it's targeted and it's strategic and it'll only harm this quote unquote military target ronald reagan was one hundred percent correct when he said you know a nuclear war cannot be won and should never be waged it was true then and it's true now no matter how much these guys who are producing these weapons or those who are benefiting from that industry try to tell us oh no it'll it'll never happen so to me that that's that's an important first first step to to continue to inform and educate and sound the alarms to people don't don't buy this crap because it's not true and i i look forward to listening to to your podcast but the psa that was put out by new york city's emergency management office about what to do in the event of a nuclear attack you would find it funny if it wasn't so deeply disturbing how they created this public service announcement they distributed it everywhere across the city on the internet i think it was on the radio where you had a woman who appeared to be an actor coming in and saying hey in the event of when the big one hits here's what you should do focus on doing these three things and i'm paraphrasing but i encourage you to to watch it i'm paraphrasing but she said get inside stay inside and stay tuned that that was it and you know get inside go away from the windows stay inside don't go outside until you get the all clear and stay tuned follow our account on instagram right and twitter and at the very end of of this this short psa she said her her closing words were we've got this mhmm and it was so disturbing in that it was so completely out of touch with reality it creates this kind of false sense of security that okay well it's kinda like here's what you do when a tornado hits or when a big storm hits and and categorizing the big one a nuclear attack within that same kind of preparedness that you would want people to have in the event of of a natural a natural disaster of some sort and and it is reflective of the carelessness with which people in our government that careless attitude that people in our government have towards nuclear war and a nuclear attack even as they set us up for failure in pushing us to the closer and closer to the brink of a nuclear war occurring whether it be an intentional attack or as we saw during the last cold war one that could be launched unintentionally you know how many near misses were there during during the last cold war i saw this documentary called the man who saved the world and it was some like mid level officer who happened to be on duty and who didn't do what he was told in in launching the the nuclear missiles because of what they thought was an incoming attack and i i it turned out to be a complete mistake or misread on the radar but that's what we're facing but by the way there's so many things to say there but one of the things that annie jacobson details is just how organized the machinery of all of this is where the humans involved don't have to think mhmm they just follow orders there's a very clear set of steps you take and that there's very few places where you can inject your humanity and be like wait a minute what's the big picture of this the only person that can think is the president of the united states the president of the united states gets six minutes after the warning the early warning system says whether it's false or not says that there we believe that there's been a nuclear weapon launched you have six minutes before you can make the decision of launch back initiate and to me that's what i'm voting based off right on the current situation you really have to see that as one of the most important aspects i agree of the united states president is who do you trust in those six minutes to sit there and i'm not really sure looking at biden and trump boy i don't know but i do know that i would like somebody who's thinking independently and not part of the machinery of warmongers that that's really i mean it's i don't wanna make it sound cynical or dramatic but sometimes in such scary situations in such dramatic situations you kinda follow the momentum yes when the right thing to do the right thing for a leader to do is to step back and look of all of human history yeah and and don't and ignore all the people in the room that are like saying stuff mhmm because most likely what they're going to be saying is warmongery type of things yes that's one of the the the the things why i also get criticized for i still think zelensky is a hero for staying in kyiv mhmm everybody was telling him to flee it was all the information was telling basically saying this the the the world's second biggest military is like coming at kyiv it's just dumb on all fronts to stay in kyiv but that's what a great leader does is ignores everybody and stays yeah screw it i'm gonna die for my country i'm gonna die as a leader and that's the right thing for leaders to do it's sad that i mean that to me that's what we should expect of our leaders yes is exactly that and it's sad that that having a leader in that position fulfill their responsibility and the oath that they take is seen as a heroic act when we should like that's the that's your job that's what we elect our leaders to do and yet so many so many have failed but to your to your point it's not cynical at all to to know that in those rooms especially in these moments of crisis unfortunately there are the predominant prevailing opinion of this warmongering establishment that's not specific to one party is the knee jerk reaction which is to go to war or to execute an act of war and and this is this is you know one of the biggest costs of this establishment destroying the reputations of and smearing and trying to cancel and censor those who are voices of peace or just those who take a contrarian position and say well hey why don't we just pause for a moment and actually think this through why don't we talk through what happens if we take this course of action what happens if we go down a different path let's actually be thoughtful about what our options are for a b and c and then make the decision in a thoughtful manner based on that even even advocating for that is seen as as a kind of heresy in in the warmongering establishment in washington and the cost of this the cost of of their retaliation against those who are reasonable voices who look at the world as it is not some fantasy that they wish existed is in those rooms during those critical moments people will even if they know in their heart or their mind that this could end really badly they their instinct is to self censor and not speak up because they don't want to experience the wrath and ire whether whether it be coming from four star generals or you know the secretaries of state or defense or these high ranking people in positions of power and influence they don't wanna be the one guy in the room who's just like hey guys let's just take a breath and actually think this through what will happen not just in the immediate response of this action that you're advocating for but what are all of the other people other actors stakeholders in the world how will they respond and then how will we respond to them how will they respond to us actually go through this exercise of in the military this this is commonly referred to as you know what are the second third fourth order of effects that will occur as a result of pursuing a specific course of action it's weird how difficult it is to be that that person in the room it requires courage yeah but it which is sad but it requires courage but why why why does it require like even just to ask okay we've been in in afghanistan and iraq for this number of years what's the exit plan right just bring that up like every day in a meeting yeah like what what's the exit plan it's it's strange that that gets criticized well the war in iraq and so on but i just remember there was this pressure you can't quite criticize or like ask dumb questions about wait what why are we going into iraq again like but they're not dumb questions right you in retrospect you're like oh they're not dumb questions at all yeah but actually it required a lot of courage yeah to ask them while still working within the institution it's easier if you're like an activist from the outside it's like sure no war this kind of stuff but within the institution in the position of power to ask the questions like maybe let's not yeah it's it seems really difficult and the same the same kind of thing in the war in ukraine and just any kind of military involvement again i guess the cynical interpretation is that it's the military industrial complex that permeates yes the just the halls of power it does and what is behind the military industrial complex and there are different examples of this you can look at the pharmaceutical industry as well there's a huge amount of money and a huge amount of power that that wields tremendous influence over members of congress you know there there are different examples of this you know across different sectors of our society but but i think the military industrial complex over time has proven itself to be the most the most powerful and influential and that's what is behind it is is this is why they try to destroy anyone who dares to ask the most obvious questions is because it is about power and wielding power well the cool thing about united states president is they have the power to say f u to the to everybody in the room i think it's just that they don't quite take that power like you really people will say like yeah the us president doesn't have that much power i don't know about that just like if you look at the law especially in military when when you're talking about war and the and the military they have a lot of power yes so they they can they can fire everybody again they have a lot of power they can stop wars they can start wars they have a lot of power the position of the presidency certainly does unfortunately we have people too often who assume the presidency from a position of weakness because they're afraid of losing power sure and so they make those calculated decisions not based on what is right or for the right reasons but instead driven by fear of loss of power and loss of of influence and that's where especially given all that we are facing we need leaders in the presidency and in congress who have courage to be that voice in the room to ask about to remain mindful of and rooted in the constitution to even as we are seeing this legislation being billed as the anti tiktok bill that's really not about tiktok it's about freedom of speech can you actually explain that bill yes this is another i guess the bottom line up front is this is another piece of legislation being expedited through congress with strong bipartisan support in the name of national security interests that is essentially a power grab and an assault on freedom and liberty and i'll i'll just say this in i think probably like the top three the top three things that they're not they're not actually telling us that's in the bill freedom of speech it's our ability to be able to express ourselves whether it be in person on a podcast on a social media platform in a newspaper whatever the platform may be this legislation gives the executive the power to decide which platforms are accept are acceptable for us to be able to use tiktok itself the words tiktok is not in actually in the bill but it gives the the power to the president to decide who is a foreign adversary single handedly no no consultation with or agreement from members of congress or anyone else it actually gives the power to a cabinet secretary to designate who is a foreign adversary and if a social media platform is has at least twenty percent ownership in a social media platform that platform may be banned from doing business in america essentially but it's not just a foreign state actor that could be named as a foreign adversary it also includes a line in the legislation that if let's say a person has at least twenty five percent financial interest or ownership in a social media platform they're an american citizen who may be working or living in some other country or working or living here but doing business with other countries if the executive branch of our government decides that this individual is under the influence of or controlled by someone that they deem a foreign adversary then that platform must not do business in america and that person obviously and even an american citizen is banned from conducting that business must they must divest essentially so when you look at and and this is where there's been a lot of chat around this when you look at elon musk for example well you already have people in the biden administration even president biden himself implying that elon musk's activities need to be investigated mhmm well he is someone with tesla who does business in a lot of countries including china and therefore he must be investigated it is not at all a stretch of imagination to say that x could be the next platform that the executive branch decides nope we've designated this person to be a foreign adversary and therefore his business interest cannot be allowed for the social media platform cannot be allowed to to exist we've seen this already with people accusing him and ex of interfering in our elections again it it's ironic that it's it's coming from the democratic party that they are claiming that a guy who has said himself he's committed to free speech and is allowing free speech on his platform and is not allowing the federal government to manipulate his platform by deeming which accounts are okay to to you know post their content and which accounts are not because of disinformation or whatever they claim it to be it's it's not an accident that the social media platforms that have been proven to take action at the behest of the federal government and the white house to censor certain voices they're not included with or being targeted at all in this legislation or or outside of it yet other platforms that are not cooperating or collaborating somehow are so the underlying issue here this is this is being sold as tiktok and national security but ultimately even as ron paul said this is this is legislation that's the greatest assault on liberty since the patriot act was passed yeah it's quite dark that this is just a graph of power it is i mean this doesn't it's not just with elon it's probably with zuck with with with facebook instagram whatsapp it puts pressure it's not just about banning but it puts pressure to for them to kinda moderate behavior yes which is a slippery slope of course it's a beautiful dance of power because you don't want tech companies to have too much power either or individuals at the top of those tech companies have too much power but then do you want that power in the hands of government no the the the history of this nation is is a fascinatingly effective journey towards the balance of power and it does seem like this this sneaky little thing as much as i hate tiktok on all fronts my brain rots every time i use tiktok i know there's also like the the the national security dangers of china and so on but it's just like tiktok man just i just i don't know it's it's so addicting it's so addicting so when i first saw this tiktok bill i was like yes no offense but then they got me the trojan horse got me no they all i mean they all you this is like the social dilemma documentary i think exposed a lot that this there there is so much there's so much that these algorithms do in these various social media platforms that that's problematic to say the least data security and privacy is a serious issue the these are serious things and so let's have a conversation about these serious things and and cease these attempts to try to have our government try to tell us what we are and aren't allowed to see you know where we are and aren't allowed to say what we wanna say that's really what it comes down to yeah more and more trust people to whenever social media companies do bullshitty things for the people to make documentaries about it to discover it for great journalists to do great journalism right and find the flaws and the hypocrisy and the like call for transparency all those kinds of things i don't trust in in most cases government regulation of technology companies because they seem to be really out of touch yeah they one they want power yeah they're really intimidated by the power that the tech companies have and two they don't seem to get it the technology at all so they're they're like hindering innovation and they're just greedy for power yeah and those are not bad combination it's a bad combination the the the thing here too though is i this extends far beyond social media companies you know the this is a very specific example but it's one example of many how those who are greedy for power are are continuing to try to find ways to tell us how to live our lives they are increasingly trying to tell us again what we're allowed to to see and hear whether it be social media companies or what shows up in our in in a google search engine for example and if they're not finding a willing and compliant social media company or big tech company then they're looking for ways to to reach their hand into those tech companies and force compliance but you know in the age of disinformation misinformation hate speech all of all of the the excuses that are given for government either directly or indirectly through big tech to try to censor certain voices it really undermines the truth which is the way to defeat bad speech is with better speech and more speech whether it's hate speech or or things that you might be offended by or things that you might disagree with the answer is not to have some entity with the power of censorship and being the quote unquote authority to decide what is good speech and acceptable and what is bad speech and unacceptable it's what you said let's let's encourage this debate and and you know encourage people who are inspired by like no man i saw this thing or this thing is happening and it's pissing me off so i'm gonna i'm going to i'm gonna bring a superior argument i'm gonna show what the right way is and and gosh what this is what our founders envisioned for us as a society in this country and we would be so much stronger with a more engaged people and a more informed people if if we had this and had it supported did you think what are the chances that the the tiktok ban bill passes the way that it passed through the house of representatives with such an overwhelming bipartisan support and so quickly and president biden saying that if it comes across his desk he'll sign it i thought it would pass through very quickly i'm i'm only slightly encouraged by the fact that the senate at least appears to be saying hey there are serious free speech concerns around this bill serious civil liberties concerns around this bill we need to do our due diligence i'm i'm i i won't say i'm cautiously optimistic because i understand how that place works but their pause at least gives people the opportunity to continue to kind of sound the alarm and for people to call their senators and express their their concerns with this that are that are very real valid concerns yeah this is really messed up just in case we didn't make it clear i think this is a really really big danger if this thing passes even if you hate elon musk or your whatever this is really really really dangerous if the government gets say over the platforms on which we communicate with each other it's a huge problem and and there's a section in there as well just just kind of the last piece on this is if you if you use a vpn mhmm and you try to use a vpn to access this you could have problems with the law and you take that a step further and say well how would they know there's a surveillance aspect mhmm to that so so once you start peeling back the layers of this really toxic onion it it it leads it really leads seriously to a pretty dark and dangerous and oppressive place you were a long time democrat you were the vice chair of the democratic national committee until you resigned in twenty sixteen to to endorse bernie i should say i love bernie i i loved him before he was cool alright anyway can you can you can you go through what happened in that situation yeah and with the democratic national committee and with bernie and why you resigned as a vice chair of the the democratic national committee one of the things that the rules of the dnc required was that officers of the dnc of which we were as i think there were five or six of us who were vice chairs at the time you have to remain neutral in a democratic primary so you're not as a party supposed to be tipping the scales in any direction for any candidate during a primary election and so i had no i had no plans to get involved in any and for any candidate or against any candidate during that primary in just the hopes of like alright we gotta make sure that this is a fair and balanced primary so that voters have the best opportunity to vote for the candidate of their choosing i saw a couple of things pretty quickly number one is that the chair of the dnc at the time was a woman named debbie wasserman schultz congresswoman out of florida and she she made very serious decisions unilaterally that many times we found out about via tweet or press release that that showed she was tilting the scales in the favor of hillary clinton in that twenty sixteen primary the other thing that i saw was how the mainstream media and those who are supposed to be in a position to be neutral arbiters to facilitate facilitate debates and forums and conversations so that voters can be best informed in who they wanna vote for we're calling hillary clinton the most qualified person ever to run for president in the history of our country because of the positions that she had held as secretary of state as a us senator as first lady and yet they glossed over those titles without ever holding her asking questions even or holding her to account for her record especially in the area of foreign policy the job she was running for was to be commander in chief to be the president of the united states that responsibility to serve as commander in chief is the foremost responsibility a president has it's it's it's essentially the one area where the president can unilaterally make decisions without without education health care immigration congress has to actually pass legislation president can come through and say hey here's the policies that i want here's legislation that i'll propose but that those changes can't be made without congress working with congress to pass them so she was she was essentially being led off the hook for her record as an american as a soldier as a veteran that was a big problem for me and so i made the decision to resign as vice chair of the dnc so that i could endorse bernie sanders who largely at heart i believe is a non interventionist he he hasn't focused a lot on foreign policy it's not it's not at the heart of what his focus has been for decades but but he was certainly far more of a non interventionist than hillary clinton who has shown through her record to be the queen of warmongers in washington i wanted to be in a position where i would have a platform to inform voters about her record so that they could make that decision for themselves so that they could see hey in this area on this issue which is incredibly important there is a clear contrast between these two candidates running in the democratic primary and that's what drove my decision to to resign and to endorse bernie sanders and that's what i went on to do throughout the rest of that primary election what do you like most about bernie the positive you know what i like most about him is is he is who he is yeah unapologetically so both in personality but also in in in what he advocates for and what he's advocated for for a long time so you know you can agree or disagree with his positions but he is who he is like i said you were a long time democrat you were for president in twenty twenty as a democrat now you're an independent and you're an excellent book describing your journey ideologically philosophically through that why did you choose to leave the democratic party in the book i go into a number of the central reasons why i made that choice but fundamental to them is that the democratic party has become a party that is opposed to freedom that is opposed to the central and foundational principles that exist within our founding documents and that serve as the identity of of who we are as americans and what this country is supposed to be about it has become a party that is controlled by this elitist cabal of warmongers who are driven who are driving forward this this quote unquote woke agenda and we see it through their racializing of everything we see this through their defund the police mission we see this through their open border policies we see this through how in their education policy they are failing our kids and how they are pushing this narrative that ultimately is a rejection of objective truth the fact that it's a question up for debate about whether or not well actually it's not a question up for debate for them they are they are actively pushing for you know boys who identify as girls to compete against girls in sports changing our language so that the word woman the identity of being a woman is is essentially being erased from our society and it is it is the height of hypocrisy and frankly an act of hatred towards women that they are so intent on doing this and ironic that it's coming from the party that for so long proclaim proclaim themselves to be the greatest feminist and the most pro woman party in the country i go into detail around each of these issues and more in in the book but you will see as we go through each of these issues fundamental and foundational to every one of them is that sadly the democratic party has become a party that is so consumed by their desire for power this insatiable hunger for power that they are willing to destroy they are willing to destroy our republic our democracy our freedom just so that they can try to hold on to power and gain more power so these are just different mechanisms for power the identity politics and the warmongering are related to each other in that their mechanisms to attain more power yes you know you may you're making it sound like only the the democratic party are full of power hungry people so to you you know the republican party i don't know if you've met those folks but some of them couple of them are are also in love with power and yes and are you know at times to some degree politicians in general are corrupt sometimes within the legal bounds sometimes slightly outside of the legal bounds and so do you to what degree is sort of the democratic party is worse than the republican party so i don't wanna paint a picture of like this kinda beautiful vision of the republican party no that there's somehow not power hungry yeah i'm i'm glad you i'm glad you brought this up you know the book the book details why after twenty or so years as a member of the democratic party i decided to leave but also and and it goes through my experiences and and things that i have seen and learned along the way but i also point out exactly that fact in the book but from the from the very beginning with the prologue is we should not be naive to think that this only exists within the democratic party there are very serious problems within both of our political parties specifically coming from politicians who are driven by this desire for power and who are so afraid of losing that power that they're willing to do whatever they feel they need to do which centers around taking away our freedom because the more free we are to make our own decisions even if they may end up being the wrong decisions but to learn from those things and know that we've gotta live with the consequences the the the beauty and messiness of what a free society looks like they're so afraid of us because they see us as the people and our freedom as the central threat to their ability to remain in power i think the difference that we're seeing today is that unfortunately we talked about this a little bit how the democratic party has become a party where you must walk in lockstep with the leadership of that party or risk or risk being faced with you know your reputation being destroyed and smeared and and all of these different attacks and the reason why they do that is to to put people like me and bobby kennedy and others up as an example of saying hey if you step out of line if you challenge us this is what we're gonna do to you the republican party has also done that and they also have politicians and leaders who are more interested in in feeding you know the thriving system in the washington establishment but we're also seeing that the republican party also has some voices and i would say increasing voices of people and i would put donald trump in this category who are challenging the quote unquote norms of the republican party that are represented by people like nikki haley or mike pence for example you know the republican party is is not a monolithic entity and you know it means different things to different people and that's where i think the real challenge in this next election is less it's really less about one political party over another and it's more about our opportunity as voters to select leaders first of all to fire those who are against freedom and who are warmongers who by their essence are willing to take away our freedom in the name of national security and vote for people nobody's perfect we shouldn't hold anybody up on a pedestal but vote for those who who are committed to the constitution and who hold those values that represent the interests of the people i'm not a fan of this choice but here we are biden versus trump so let me ask you sort of a challenging question of pros and cons can you can you give me pros and cons of each what's the biggest strength and biggest limitation of let's say biden this is a tough this is a tough question i i've known i've known president biden for a lot of years i knew his son beau who served at the in the national guard the same time that i did i i consider joe biden a friend he is someone over the years that i've talked to and shared laughs with and spent time with in different situations the positive characteristics that drew me to joe biden of the past they are not represented in how he has led as president and you know i'll let the pundits theorize as to how that is or why that is but the truth that i i know exists which points to his his weakness is that instead of listening to his better angels he has instead at every turn if if you go back and you you know i i look back to his inauguration speech where he promised to be a president for all americans and you know during his campaign promised to be the uniter in chief to bring a country together that was deeply divided that that's the joe biden that i've known for many years a guy who has you know worked with different people with different backgrounds and different political views but but tried to find at at different points in time a way to a way to work together at every turn he has done the exact opposite of what he spoke about during his inauguration speech and has left us as the american people today more divided less secure both from an economic standpoint as well as a a national security or a safety and security standpoint and less free as a society and as a people so the biggest criticism would be divide he divided us so continue the division that's been that's been there who who do you be the greatest uniter like to me over the past few decades to me obama you've been very critical of obama on the foreign policy side mhmm on many fronts but to me that guy did really good maybe some people say just rhetoric but i think rhetoric matters when you're president i think he was out of all the presidents we had is probably the most effective uniter of the people would that be fair to say during his two thousand eight campaign yes i think that his message resonated with so many people across generations and across you know different views different backgrounds to where you know people cried on the night that he was elected because they felt so hopeful i i talk to people and i know people who set aside their entire lives to work on his campaign to be a part of this this hope and change mission that he laid out that that would bring us together you know some of some of the people that i know personally they gave up their lives during the campaign and after he won they went to washington dc because they wanted to be able to do the work that they had that he had laid out and continue to be a part of this mission that they expected would extend beyond the campaign and they've expressed to me personally how heartbroken they were because so quickly after he was elected instead of bringing in a new generation of fresh leadership that was not a part of the washington establishment he instead immediately chose to surround himself with people who were more of the same old same old who were essentially part of part of the problem and many of his actions after that proved that fear and that broken heart that brokenheartedness that they felt to be true and and i'll mention one example related to civil liberties that we talked about he was someone as a us senator who gave some pretty powerful speeches on the senate floor about his concerns with the patriot act his concerns with surveillance from the nsa his concerns with a violation of our fourth amendment rights and civil liberties but when as president he was confronted with leaked information about this surveillance occurring under those authorities in his presidency he cited he took the side of the national security state and did not take action to right the wrongs that he correctly pointed out as senator and during his campaign for the presidency which is unfortunate because he really did build this unifying momentum throughout his campaign what do you think that is why is it so hard as a president to kinda act on the on the promises of the campaign but also just i mean his speech his basically anti war speech that really resonated to me the fact that he was against the war yeah in iraq i believe early yeah early on and that that was a huge point of distinction between him and hillary clinton mhmm probably one of the biggest why why is it so hard when you step into the office of president to sort of act on your ideals i think it goes back to what we talked about a little bit which is you know what are what are you driven by and what are you afraid of and if you are concerned for whether or not you can get reelected who's going to fund that reelection effort who's going to fund the presidential library and your legacy that will follow there there have been some documented examples around how he promised to crack down on big pharma but when push came to shove his department of justice campaign funding was threatened and they chose not to take action even when they had a very very strong case to make this was with regard to the opioid crisis in the country and and you know this this just goes back to the heart of why it's so essential that we have leaders who who have courage and who are focused on doing what we elect them to do and who are resistant to to the love of money and power yes it's hard and we are human we are fallible we are flawed by nature and i'll go into kind of the the next one you asked about trump mhmm the weakness side and the lessons that i hope have been learned from twenty sixteen for him and his team is you you have to be in a position where you are surrounding yourselves with other people of courage who aren't just thinking about their next political job or their next job getting a cable news contract or looking for fame themselves or looking at how they can monetize their position for their whatever their next financial interest might be but people of courage who know what they're up against to to really seriously clean house across the federal government and the corruption and rot that is so deeply entrenched in order to truly be effective and if he is reelected that that is that is my hope that he sees that he's learned from what went wrong in twenty sixteen that you know he went in you know with a largely non interventionist more focused on peace agenda and yet he surrounded himself with people who are at the heart of the warmongers in washington and who directly went against the the policies that he advocated for on the strength side i think it's it's it's easy to point out because it's also what has caused him to be so attacked in ways that we haven't seen before certainly not in my lifetime by by the democrats by the biden administration not only in now but you know something that started back in in twenty sixteen when he was a a candidate he's a guy who you know by all measures has been successful in his own life and because of that he's not coming in with this desire to please washington that many other politicians have and because he is so willing to challenge the quote unquote norms and these are not norms that serve the interests of the american people these are norms that serve the interests of the most powerful he is a he is a direct threat and so that attitude and that mindset of not coming in with the kind of caution that too many politicians come in with of wanting to be the popular one at the parties or whatever it is that they want that that is the strength that he brings yeah i i just had a conversation with dana white and he he's good friends with trump and he talks to the fact that he seems to be resistant to the attacks is some aspect to that is it's just the psychology of being able to withstand the attacks that that are there in in the political game and that can break people like you just don't want the headaches so to withstand the attacks is tough and something about his psychology allows for for that i mean i guess the question for you also in your own psychology you've been attacked quite a bit we've mentioned some of that sort of misrepresentations and how do you deal with that by yourself like how do you not become cynical or or overcompensate the other direction that kind of stuff it really stems from having a clear sense of purpose i never saw you know i've i've served in state government i've served on our city council in honolulu and served in congress but at no time have i have i seen this as a quote unquote political career i don't have that ladder climbing ambition that a lot of politicians have my sense of purpose is deeply rooted in my my dedication and and my desire in my life to be pleasing to god and to live a life of service and what better way to be pleasing to god than to try to do my best to work for the well-being of god's children being rooted in that has made it so that as the attacks are coming from different directions even as people who i was friends with former colleagues of mine others even family members even as they have turned away or become attackers against me themselves because of different reasons related to politics of course it's it's a sad thing especially when it's someone that you know you know personally and have had a a personal friendship or relationship with but i don't live my life trying to please politicians or please the people who show up on tv or or anyone else as long as i am doing my best to be pleasing to god that is where i draw my happiness from and my fulfillment and contentment and strength so you you spoken about the value of religious faith in your life of your hindu faith and seeing the bhagavad gita as a spiritual guide so what role does faith and god play in your life it's everything it is central to who i am what inspires me what motivates me where i find strength where i find peace where i find shelter and where i find happiness and this has been a constant throughout you know times of challenge times of darkness times of heartbreak times of happiness in in always feeling very secure in knowing that god's unconditional love is ever present and no matter what else is happening in my life that god is my best friend and remaining centered and grounded in always remembering that and meditating upon that truth is it's everything to me the interesting thing about the hindu god is how welcoming the religion is of other religions just it's true how accepting it is it's so in that way in many ways it's one of the most beautiful religions on earth so like who who do you think god is to you like in in the specifically the texts but also you you personally what does he represent so for for hinduism it's also god can be many there's also like a aspect where there's a it's like a part of all of us there's like a uniting thing not a singular figure outside of us i think one of the things that's most commonly misunderstood about hinduism that people don't know is that that hinduism is truly a monotheistic religion that there is one god and he goes by many names that describe his different qualities and characteristics and and as you pointed out hinduism is uniquely of a nonsectarian spiritual practice essentially it's not a religion that you convert into or you leave behind or whatever the case may be bhagavad gita a central scripture and text that comes from india literally means song of god and the principles that that are conveyed throughout the bhagavad gita are applicable to all of us they are timeless truths that whether you consider yourself christian or catholic or you know muslim or jewish or hindu these these truths are are eternal and and relevant through all time so for us as as kids growing up we we learned from and had bedtime stories that came from both the bhagavad gita and the new testament my dad was raised catholic my mom was raised episcopalian and both of them were attracted to the bhagavad gita as they were in their own lives searching for a more personal relationship with god than they had been able to find elsewhere in their own spiritual journeys and that's where the application of you know there there are teachings in the bhagavad gita for example that talk about bhakti yoga bhakti yoga essentially translates into dedicating your life striving to develop a loving relationship with god karma yoga there's a a chapter in the bhagavad gita that speaks about karma yoga karma is a word that has become a part of the you know both karma and yoga have become very common terms but what it really means is trying to dedicate your actions in life that have in a way that have a positive impact on others being of service to others and so for me growing up i never really understood as a kid the idea of sectarianism of one religion battling against another because i knew and understood and experienced that the the real meaning of religion was love for god no matter what name you worship him by or or how you worship that that is the real meaning of religion and the application of that in in your life is is you know you ask how do i see god in a personal way i see i i know that god is my best friend god is my confidant when i am struggling with with a problem in my life or you know during those quiet moments by myself where i am anxious or i'm sad i turn to god for that solace for that clarity for that strength to both know what the right thing to do is and the strength to act accordingly and and to constantly strive to further develop that very personal loving relationship with god chelsea this is an honor to finally meet you to talk to you this is amazing thank you thank you lex it's so wonderful to be here thank you for the opportunity thanks for listening to this conversation with tulsi gabbard to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from dwight d eisenhower in his nineteen sixty one farewell address a vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment our arms must be mighty ready for instant action so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction american makers of plowshares could with time and as required make swords as well but now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions this conjunction of immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the american experience yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
