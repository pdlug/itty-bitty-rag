description and now dear friends here's john donahue the adcc is the premier submission grappling tournament in the world we just had it a couple of weeks ago we saw many demonstrations of greatness from athletes you coached but a year ago the team and you were at a very low point take me through that journey what was the lowest point we had a very very tight team for many years which began in new york city during the peak of covid training in new york became very difficult to sustain so most of the team despised the city of new york i i was the only person in the group that liked living in new york i think part of the problem was that i was the only one who actually lived in manhattan the others had to commute to new york and there's a world of difference between living in new york and commuting to new york so most of them had a very negative view of new york city that was compounded by covid when even the basic act of training became very very difficult and so everyone decided they want to leave so there was a prospect of a complete breakup between myself and the team or i would have to leave new york i that was a difficult decision for me to make because i'd lived in new york for thirty years i had built my life there and had most of my friends and associates that i know here in america were new yorkers so i thought you know these guys have been insane incredibly loyal to me as students so i should also be loyal to them of course so i decided that if they wanted to leave i would go with them we decided to go to puerto rico because there was a a private gym where we could train through the covid period i personally wanted to go to texas i thought that texas was a a better place for the team to go but many of the students including senior students like gordon ryan craig jones had been to puerto rico and stayed with one of the head officials of adcc mojasm so they loved their experience in puerto rico and almost everyone wanted to go down there so i tried to explain to him there's a world of difference between going to a place for vacation versus living there but that didn't have any effect so the decision was made majority decision was made to go to puerto rico in puerto rico the conditions in which the team lived changed significantly when you're in new york new york is such a big city that if there's any tension between team members and inevitably there will be any competitive sport where everyone's fighting each other you can kind of bury them in the size of the city because there's so many distractions in new york you know you come in you do your workout you go outside and it's it's new york city in puerto rico we lived in a very small local town dorado and most of the athletes were living with each other and so unlike new york where there was always a break you train together but when training was over you went about your life in new york and new jersey with everyone living in very close proximity to each other any tensions got magnified because there was no relief from them you didn't get to get away from people if you had a problem with someone on the mat well now you had to to to live with them for the rest of the the day and the night and this goes on for long periods of time so i believe it had the effect of magnifying whatever tensions there were in particular there was a a family tension between two brothers which magnified over time and you know as as so often is the case you get two brothers growing up one older one younger and the younger one wants to grow and and feels somewhat like a a young tree underneath a bigger tree and sometimes people just need their space so there was there was some unhappiness and as a younger brother i can understand yeah yeah as a little tree that had to grow up under a bigger tree yeah so fuck the big tree my god there's a lot of aggression i have to work on i'm sorry unresolved family issues coming out here like that's for sure joking i love you he doesn't he's lying so as time went by these these tensions started increasing they came to a a point where it was difficult for them even to be in the training room together at that point you're starting to you know when once training takes a hit then you you gotta start to address these the attempts at reconciliation fell through and a decision was made to to move to texas i wanted everyone to move as a team what i wanted to do was keep the team together as long as the period leading up to adcc so that everyone could train together so i said okay there's problems but let's just tough it out one year we moved to texas let's just go there and keep unity if some people don't wanna train with other people that's fine but i believe that the team would be weakened by breaking apart i believe that they had an excellent rapport as training partners their technical level was increasing dramatically many of the younger athletes are really starting to come into their own and really develop well and so my take on it was okay if there's problems so be it but let's all just stay together until adcc twenty twenty two is a unified team go out prepare yourselves as best you can and and then after that we can make a decision as to whether we break up or not but that was rejected and the team split and they moved to austin we'd made prior arrangements to go to a local gym and they took that gym and we were left with no gym and more or less homeless in in austin so i year out from adcc yes this is one year out so roughly three quarters of the competitive athletes left in in one week so at that point that was probably the lowest point because at at that point not only did we not have a place to train we had very few training partners for the few that had remained and the main athlete in the team gordon ryan was going through a particularly bad spell with his unresolved stomach issues and there was doubt as to whether or not he could compete at all and was actively thinking about retiring from the sport so maybe not compete ever again potentially yeah yeah so that that was a time when it's like man this the whole program seems to be dead in the water at this point most of the competitive athletes were gone there were very few training partners for the few that remained and the main athlete around whom the the group had initially bonded was seemingly out of action possibly permanently where was your mind what were you mentally my my my thinking is everything bad passes in time i've had a lot of bad points in my life so my life experience is whenever things seem dark have patience time will ultimately cure most ills not all of them but most of them and i'm confident that if you give me a new crop of students i can i can produce magic but it's gonna take time so that confidence was though in part a source of strength yes it's just like i i wasn't confident that adcc twenty twenty two would go well because we only had one year without a gym and with a team that was completely broken up to to to even an attempt to get into adcc so things looked a little grim but i was confident you know given enough time i would get in a new group of students and and work as it turns out one of the demonstration partners that i used during filming for instructional videos he lives in boston giancarlo badoni was interested in the idea of coming down and training but he'd always felt like it would be difficult because there were people in his weight class who who were already there and he felt it would be awkward but now that they had left that opened up an area for him so he was the first one to come down he moved from boston to austin texas i began teaching at a local school it was rather like going back into my earliest days in jiu jitsu i went from teaching at the big hensel gracie academy to a tiny school in puerto rico and now an even smaller school in austin texas and locals would come in and train and i would watch every day teaching there twice a day seven days a week and i would see people come in and train and i would say this guy has some potential or this guy has some potential and i would recruit people and bring them to an another gym where they would train with the professionals and if they proved adept and hardworking and someone who can work well in a team they would stay and and build their skills as time went by more and more such people started coming in and we had some remarkable people like a young south african purple belt luke griffith came in he had lost in the european trials for adcc and he was down on his luck he came into austin he did a a show against a local purple belt and lost again so he was feeling bad about his performance and his future and he came in and i i thought he was a a lovely kid who worked hard and trained well so he became one of the main training partners he was similar size to gordon so i encouraged him to train with with gordon whenever he could and more and more people started coming in to train under that kind of basis one day i got a text from gordon who was filming an instructional video in boston he said hey you know nicholas miragali was training at this he was shooting video at the same time as me and we we just did some grappling he's a really nice guy and he's literally never trained with without a gi before he's for those of you who don't know nicholas miragale is one of the outstanding gi jiu jitsu competitors of his generation has an amazing game and is is a superstar with with the the gi side of the sport but had never even trained without a gi once in his life so his first ever no gi training session is with gordon ryan the best no gi competitor of all time and i remember gordon texting me saying hey he's really talented he's a nice guy and he wants to come down to texas and train so so yeah sounds great so over time just more and more people started coming in and i told everyone like you guys are at a severe disadvantage like you you're you've got very little time to get ready for adcc luke wasn't even in adcc he had to win trials same for dan matasoy he he'd failed at trials and needed to get a win to even get into adcc so around this time a doctor suggested by mo jazem who had himself had stomach issues earlier in his life began working with gordon ryan and and moe is the organizer of adtc yes yep he's the the head organizer he was able to get gordon ryan not cured but significantly better than he was before and to a level where gordon could could train up to five to six days a week and it was a big improvement on what was going on during the end of the time in puerto rico so things started moving we had a core group of athletes training at a local gym which was very very generously offered to us by the head manager of roka sunglasses a company here in austin texas they have a private corporate gym which we were able to to train in and these talented youngsters from around the globe essentially came together and said you guys are gonna have to train harder than you've ever trained in your lives because you've got less time to get ready for this than anyone and you're gonna be going up against people potentially who know exactly what i teach because i've been teaching them a lot longer than i've been teaching you in addition to the other best people in the world so it was an incredible challenge for them and i must say all of them gave literally everything they had everything i asked for they gave twice as much and we had a crazy training schedule as many as three classes per day i know that sounds easy you know three classes a day right but try doing it sometime these classes are not your average classes these are preparation for adcc so they're both mentally and physically trained very very hard and we had many people come in and try to train alongside us and they fell off by the side of the road within days forget about weeks months or a full year of this i gave a very abbreviated set of skills for the athletes i chopped everything down to what i believe were the the most essential skills anything that wasn't essential to adcc preparation was just pushed aside and they had to focus almost entirely on adcc with one exception i'll come to that soon over the the period of their training here in austin so it was compacted by time and also by the breadth of skill that i taught everything was just purely for adcc preparation in a very short period of time dan manasoyo and luke griffith and oliver taza all won european trials and got into adcc nicholas miragale was already a superstar so he was invited but he had to show himself so we enrolled him in local shows here in austin where he had his first three no gi matches and with each match you could see progress being made and so that convinced the adcc people okay he's good enough to to compete he ended up winning decisively a match against one of the greatest american of all time rafael lovato and this was like the a clear sign that his skill level and no gi was sufficient to to justify an invite and by the way lovato an incredible set of matches in this adcc yeah that was actually very impressive and retired yeah which is really impressive and heartbreaking as well but if you go out that's a good way to go out indeed so there was this long and and tough preparation and it was compounded by the fact that as gordon felt better he felt a need to build up his own competitive record prior to adcc because he'd been inactive for so long with his stomach issue so he proposed one of the most ambitious fight camps that i've ever heard of in grappling which was he would take on the current wno champion pedro marino who's number one is wno yeah and also i believe the current no no gi world champion in ibjjf as a tune up match as a warm up match then he would fight his old nemesis felipe pena the only man who submitted gordon at black belt and had defeated gordon in an adcc match in two thousand and seventeen and then adcc itself so there was gonna be three big high profile matches back to back and and very different rule sets so w and o was a fifteen minute match the fight with felipe pinna was no time limit which is a very different format to compete in and then adcc so we had to drag out a fourteen week camp covering three matches with three different rule sets which went in diametrically opposite directions and the entire team had to go through all of this over this fourteen week period in addition to the previous year that they had been working hard there was a further complication in the midst of all this nicolas miragali had to go to the ghee world championships and we had to throw an extra morning class for that to help him get ready nicolas went on to win the open weight gold medal in ziggy competition and then the next day he had to come back to texas and begin his adcc preparation it was a crazy crazy time but they all came through it so well i'm i'm immensely proud of what they did and shockingly in the space of less than twelve months we went from rock bottom to having a more successful adcc team performance than we did the previous adcc it was in fact the most successful team performance of the event and is testimony to how hard those those young men worked in in the course of less than a year to prepare themselves if it can just linger on the low point is it heartbreaking to you that the so called donahue death squad split or the team as it was originally called split you know we live a short life on this earth and you put so much of your love and work into this team and everybody put in the work does it break your heart it was a sad time yeah it was it was you know i'm not a particularly emotional person but it was a it was an emotional time for everyone it was it had an element of tragedy insofar as not only was it a team breakup it was also a family breakup which is much more serious i do believe that in time even the most intense family breakups can be reconciled and i also believe that once dialogue begins people will remember just how easy it was for us to get along and how tight we were for many many years it's so easy to let a minute of anger destroy ten years of of of friendship so but there's also the weight of those ten years like when i ran into the old squad members at adcc we got along like a house on fire it's like we never had a problem so a house on fire is a good thing yes yes sorry that's a new zealand expression yeah yeah that that definitely could have gone the other way right so only a new zealander would say that is a good thing yeah so there's this i i still believe you know in in time things will be fine but there was an element where you know youngsters need to grow and sometimes think think about it this way from the athlete's perspective there's a definitely a generational problem i'm much older than my students okay and the the the years and the the viewpoint that i have is a reflection of the time in which i grew up and they're from a completely different generation with a completely different world view it's it's gotta be hard from the athlete's perspective when you're training seven days a week and you you're getting very very good you're beating everyone that's getting getting put in front of you you're losing very very rarely and it's always a tough competitive match when you do everyone around you is calling you a superstar and you look phenomenal you check social media everyone's saying you're you're a god on the mat and then you come into the gym and there's some old guy telling you you're not good enough and every day it's like oh what does this guy want from me how how hard do i have to work like you're not good enough like i want you to be the best in the world i want you to be good i want you to be great and all of your friends are telling you hey man you're incredible you submit me so easily do this you and then this old guy is just saying no you gotta get better you gotta work more you're not working hard enough at some point you're gonna be like you know what fuck this old guy yep like it's it's tough you know i mean i i get why you know they they last when i was twenty years old i didn't get along with authority figures at all and to have someone telling you you you've always gotta work that little bit harder and know your skill set's not complete you still need this this and this when you're already doing very very well and far better than all what a tiny tiny percentage of people and then you've got this guy just constantly telling you no more has to be done you're not there yet i can you know of course i understand you just want let me let me just enjoy this more like it's always a choice in life you you can be the best you possibly can or you can go a route where you just get to enjoy life a little more you do other things you know like there's more to the to life than just the inside of a gym and learning how to do a better heel hook or a better double leg so of course you know years go by you wanna try other things and you have to make this choice in life between extreme excellence versus being incredibly good but maybe just enjoying my life a little more it's so interesting that incredibly good is a hard thing to deal with i saw like when kayla harrison won her first gold medal and at the olympics you know to go back to the gym and to trust again the maybe the old man you're you're being you're questioning yourself but to trust the old man so jimmy page or jimmy page or senior in that case to say okay we're gonna go back to this grind and there's still a path to improvement there's still a lot to grow and still have the humility even though you've just demonstrated greatness so really good is just a stepping stone to to to to true greatness that's really tough for athletes like winning is actually very difficult yeah gold medals are very difficult plus there's the personal stuff of depression that comes with that which is you give so much of yourself to trying to win that and once you do there's a lot of personal stuff you have to deal with which is like what what what do i want from life to understand what is exactly what am i chasing is it just winning or is it some bigger picture of excellence that's beyond just winning so that that's all all of that mixed up together and then when you have to be as a team really close together there's the personal relationships all of that gets exacerbated yeah do you think the team ever gets back together i think there's you know there's definitely a chance of that right now i think they have a an excellent team themselves and they're doing very well they had an excellent performance at adcc so there's not a need for them to to come to us it's not like they they lack anything they still remember everything i taught them they still coach and teach with the same methodology that i taught them so i don't think they have any need to do so if they did it would be because they wanted to i still think many of the same personality conflicts that originated the conflict would reemerge currently if if they started training together by the way to to pile on the compliments they have really nice merch too the t shirts are just excellent what have you learned from that process about how to have a team with personal conflicts do you have to deal with these giant egos as well yeah because ego is a is a in part a super power too so you don't wanna yeah you you don't wanna suppress egos like i i always laugh when people say leave your ego at the door like what what do you think drives competition like if you wanna be good at anything in life you gotta have an ego no i i don't believe it's good or even a healthy thing to suppress egos i'm i'm a realist and i understand that this is a sport where they make one gold medal per weight division this as guys get better they're gonna be looking at their training partners and thinking like i'm gonna have to fight this guy one day and they're training next to each other of course there's gonna be tension there's always gonna be disagreements about you know what's the right way to act around certain people certain issues and people are gonna come into conflict everyone's been programmed to be a a an alpha competitor and you get a room full of people like that there's gonna be conflict now your question was well is there a way to resolve this yeah there was and for eight to nine years i was very successful with this but there's also a tipping point where things can flare out of control and there will be periodic breakups you know you're not the first students i had that that left i've been coaching a lot longer than i've been coaching the squad and i'm sure in the future there'll be other students who leave me that's just the nature of the beast it's sad when it happens but life goes on like bukowski said love is a fog that fades with the first daylight of reality or something like that so even love is temporary let me ask you about leading up the the preparation for the athletes i mean this is such given the darkness from from a year ago from which you had to find glimmers of light and try to get greatness out of athletes what was the mental preparation like for gordon for nicholas for giancarlo for the other athletes what was the mental side of things like is there some key insights you can give to their mental preparation i really think that people when they talk about mental preparation need to take a step back and realize that almost every element of what people describe as mental preparation has physical underpinnings literally ninety five percent of what i teach the athletes is physical skills and it's my belief that every mental aspect of competition the most important of which will be confidence on stage is a direct result of the the accumulation of physical skills people tend to see things like confidence as a mental state it is but it comes out of the performance of physical skills all my life i've seen sports psychologists try to create confidence in athletes through nonphysical means and it always ends up being the same kind of cheesy motivational speeches highlight video reels where they try to pump artificial confidence into people and i've never been impressed by this nor have i seen it have any kind of positive effect on on athlete performance what i do see build confidence is the sense that athletes are developing skills and using them successfully under conditions that closely mirror the event they're preparing for once they get this down that's where true confidence comes from confidence doesn't come from words it comes from accumulated skills which experience shows you have been responsible for successful performances in the past and if you accumulate enough of these your confidence rises so when it comes to the mental aspects of competition i created a program where everyone had a was given a set of skills that they had to work on skills directly related to what i believe are most important elements of success in adcc competition in the gym they accumulated those skills over time i do it in two different ways depending on whether these are offensive skills or defensive skills for the accumulation of offensive skills i like to have my athletes work with athletes who are lesser than themselves in ability so that they start to gain confidence over time just as you would never send a beginner into a weightlifting gym and put five hundred pounds on the bar and tell him to lift it rather you would start with a wooden bar then the metal bar and then gradually accumulate weight over time so you get a progression in weightlifting so to induce you you don't take a brand new move and say okay do it on gordon ryan never gonna succeed i have the athletes practice their offense on blue belts and work their way up defense on the other hand you've got to start them in the deep end of the pool so that they start to see what are their vulnerabilities okay so i put them with highly competitive athletes at the start so they can see okay there is a problem here and then even in defense they start off with lower belts and build up their confidence over time so just as a weightlifter builds up his ability to build weight sorry to lift weight over time so to a jiu jitsu player does it by gradually increasing resistance now in jiu jitsu resistance is not done by weight it's done by skill level and so over time they started to accumulate this experience in time they we were able to switch off and have them go against very very tough athletes each other so you know luke griffith will do a full power match with gordon ryan now they're fully aware that there's no one better in the world than gordon ryan so if you have a competitive match with gordon ryan that's a very very healthy sign so they went from the start where they were being programmed going against relatively mild resistance and building up over time and then building up to the greatest resistance possible in the sport of jiu jitsu and their goal is not to win obviously but their goal is to provide a a competitive match now gordon doesn't have any confidence issues so for him it's just good hard competitive training against people that are in some ways better than those you'll be facing in competition for the other guys it's getting a clear assessment of what their current skill level is by going against the best there is then we add to this a competitive schedule where the athletes have to go out into competition so they get used to the idea of performing in front of strangers on stage getting used to the the the strange elements of going out being observed and judged by people you don't know in a performance atmosphere and so they were all given matches in wno competition leading up to the event adcc trials local grappling events here in austin and given a competitive schedule to fight and prepare them for adcc obviously as adcc got closer and closer this is pulled back because of the danger of injury so within about three weeks out was the last time we had a competition and by this method confidence starts to grow and and so the mental preparation came out of those physical underpains the idea of progressive resistance increasing over time for both offense and defense building up to a peak where they're going against the best athlete in the world so they can get an accurate assessment of where they stand once you're given a competitive match to the best guy in the world you know damn well that when you go out in adcc you're ready to fight anybody and defense is broadly defined so defense in in symmetrical positions like positions like guard and then defense also includes escaping from horrible positions yes we're big believers in the idea of depth of defense the idea that you should be able to mount defense all the way through from early stages based mostly around anticipation of identifying danger visually before it emerges and all the way through to the deepest levels of defense where you are one hundred percent defensive in terrible positions and you have to claw your way out and over time and and get back to a neutral position or even better back to an attacking position you have an instagram post on this topic when you get ready to step out for the biggest moment of your life ask yourself one question how different is this really from what i do every day if the answer is not very different at all then step forward with confidence and do what you do every day in the same manner and ignore the hype and distraction you're ready for action by the way for people who don't know you need to follow john donner donner john on instagram because you have nuggets or large buckets of nuggets of wisdom often which is quite profound even bigger than jiu jitsu but anyway so there is some aspect where you want to mimic the conditions of your daily training in intensity in in what force of physical to that of the actual yeah matches you asked the question about mental training for for me the central focus of whatever small amount of mental training i give my students comes down to a a very very simple concept to understand this is the idea of identifying competition in terms of its normalcy most people see training and competition as two different things training is normal activity that you do every day and competition is the exception okay it's different you're going out there's people watching you there's a big crowd they're making lots of noise in fact the promoters of shows go out of their way to reinforce this look at for example adcc when gordon ryan went to fight andre galvan okay do they just come out on the mat and fight each other absolutely not there's music there's pageantry there's fireballs they're literally shooting fireballs yeah some dude in a tie sitting with joe rogan the son of the meathead podcaster comedian whatever which one was the meathead well well played john donohoe well played but you see what they're trying to do they're trying to create theater and pageantry when in fact it's just a grappling match it's just two athletes a referee and a rule set that's the reality now what they try to sell you is something which is not reality which is this is somehow bigger and different and they reinforce this with pageantry and theater so that it becomes not just a grappling match but a grappling performance the same way you have a theater performance and my goal as a coach is to dispel that and say when you go out there there's only one reality you him and the referee reinforcing a rule set that's it everything else you see the smoke the fire the music is an illusion and it's put there intentionally to make you feel a certain kind of way and your whole goal is to see this as illusion and walk out and see only the reality which is that this is the same damn thing you do every day in the gym the only difference is you're going with a guy you've never grappled before so the actual act of removing the illusion or realizing that it is an illusion how do you practice that so when you step on the mat once you're aware of it i i i always have them to you it it it it's like when you yeah when you see a magician and you have his tricks explained to you you never see the magic again the first time you see a good card trick from a a good magician it's oh my god then when they explain it to you i i did this this and that step one step two then you look at it like it's not that special and when you explain to people this idea of the pageantry is an illusion then just as when you watch the magician and you learn the trick all the magic flies out the window so too with the the nervous response so that's for the pageantry but what about maybe the physical intensity of competition isn't there an extra no it's the same in every competition it's it's not like you know they're twice as strong in adcc as they are and and the ibgf world championships it's the physical intensity is always pretty much the same they experience it every day in the gym and like you know if you if you go out and you grapple gordon ryan it's not like the next guy you grapple is gonna be twice as strong as him or twice as fast it's it's be a little stronger a little faster but not so much so that it completely changes your approach of the game you know there's not that much difference between the human bodies out there on stage so if you if you've felt intensity before you're not gonna be shocked by adcc but in terms of in training do you have to try to match the intensity of competition no that would be false you'd be every athlete in the gym would be injured you can do it for short periods of time but the the training has to be carefully monitored in terms of intensity levels remember we're training seven days a week a minimum of twice a day you you've gotta keep things under wraps like you know every other workout you can have a like one of the five rounds can be full power but not seven days a week three times a day that's that's just gonna break bodies and the full power is just a reminder of it's more about skill development for us it's all it always comes back to skill development but what about matching the the feeling of the intensity of competition yeah periodically periodically can't be rarely single time not not really it's not rare like meaning like you know one day like like out of you know three hours of hard sparring per day like fifteen minutes might be like one hundred percent full power that way you you that's more than enough to get psychologically ready for the intensity of conflict but but won't break your body over time intensity of conflict that's well put there is competition does doesn't it have that extra level of animosity i guess it's a little bit more conflict than it is it can sometimes there's personality differences like for example like gordon ryan and felipe pinna they admire each other a lot they respect each other's skills but they they certainly don't like love each other that's for sure so so there there can be certain matchup where there's more intensity but then there's other matchups where the two athletes come out and it's it's no more intense than a hard sparring session so first of all because i would love to look at a couple of matches with you and before that let me say big thank you to flow grappling for first of all helping the sport of grappling

inexpensive if if you care about grappling it's definitely worth it you should sign up anyway my love goes out to flow grappling and also my love goes out to moe jasem as we said he's the organizer of adcc the next one is in twenty twenty four it should be twenty twenty four well you should follow adcc underscore official on instagram most prestigious it's like where the best grapplers in the world show up and the magic happens it's like some of the most historic matches in grappling in jiu jitsu ever happened on that stage anyway if i could talk about some of the interesting performances for the athletes you coach you post on instagram let's start with gordon ryan gordon ryan adcc twenty twenty two the greatest event in grappling history is over new stars emerged established stars shown bright again but one man stood above all like a colossus gordon ryan you have a way with words john donner i have seen many incredible feats of grappling but i've never saw a performance like this for many mister ryan is a polarizing figure in the sport for many others an inspiration to look up to but after this weekend there was no disagreement amongst haters and fans about his merit he is the best ever it was a long and difficult journey to adcc twenty twenty two just one year ago and so on as you told the story it was a virtuoso performance of unmatched technique preparation and confidence no one else can claim credit for this achievement this was his and his alone no one else today brings together technical depth tactical insight and confidence to use them on stage as he does i had many students but i only one gordon ryan and i think gordon responded all this is true besides the credit that sits with you thank you and a a heart emoji very nice so anyway that's a as a way of introduction to goran ryan can you take me through his set of performances and maybe any matches that stand out so he competed in his division which is the plus ninety nine kilos and in the super fight against andre gervais that's correct this was in fact the first time in in history that this was allowed for your listeners who don't follow grappling we may have been very rude in just throwing a lot of stuff at you without explaining ourselves first of all adcc is like the olympics of grappling it occurs every two years you can either qualify for the event through winning matches and a qualification process or you can be invited the only people who get invited are either former winners or people in the sport who are just widely recognized superstars who bring some kind of brand value who have proven in the past that they have what it takes to compete at that level in this format there are two kinds of matches there are weight division matches in which you compete against people your own roughly your own size and weight there is an open weight where anyone of any size can enter so you can have very small people fighting very large people and there is a second category called a super fight where established champions who have won previous open weight tournaments fight each other in one off battles one athlete against another so in most of the matches you will you will fight repetitively over time towards a gold medal but in one category you fight one fight the so called super fight which is usually the headline fight of the event traditionally if you were in the super fight you could not compete in the weight categories it was seen as too risky because you might get injured during the weight category or you might have to fight four very tough fights in a row and get exhausted so that you're ineffective during the main event of the of of the show the super fight so throughout its history adcc has always resisted the idea of an athlete being allowed to do both weight category and super fight it's never happened before gordon ryan requested to be able to do this because of his extraordinary stature in the sport the adcc organization granted his request that was the first time ever in addition gordon ryan would be fighting to be the first person to win three gold medals in three different weight categories this has never been done before so it was a huge event on gordon's part and bear in mind also that prior to this event he had fought just a month and a half earlier against a former adcc open weight champion felipe pena who had defeated him in the past in a completely different rule set and then previous to that against the current world champion so there had been a buildup to this so he'd been very active coming up to the event and then he went in to fight arguably the greatest adcc champion of all time andre galvan which would occur late on sunday and would have to fight the toughest people including the possibility of fighting his nemesis felipe pena in the weight division prior to getting to the super fight so there was genuine concern here that he may have completely overstepped himself the biggest concern i had as a coach and i'm sure the organizer's moe jazz and must have had the the same concern is that he would get injured or exhausted fighting in his weight division there were two athletes in particular felipe pena who had given gordon a very tough forty minute match in a no rules setting shortly before adcc and his former training partner nick rodriguez who were expected to give gordon very very tough matches if they came up against each other so there was a genuine concern that gordon may burn himself out before he even got to fight the guy who most people believe is the greatest adcc champion of all time so our concern was how do we manage this so what we looked for is extremely efficient methods of reducing the time of the matches making the matches as short as possible our favorite way to fight bigger stronger athletes and i think gordon was the lightest athlete in in his weight division everyone goes oh gordon's so big and strong he's actually quite light i think he was outweighed by almost all of his opponents it's nice to see gordon looking small relative to his opponents which is absurd to say but it is the open division plus ninety nine kilos yeah it was plus ninety nine kilos right that's what i mean sorry by open plus ninety nine kilos everyone looks like the incredible hulk yeah yeah so our big thing is when we fight bigger stronger opponents we always go in two directions you either go for the legs or you go for the back and so we constructed strategies based around those two methods so going for submissions and we should also mention that adcc rule set is for regular matches i think it's five minutes and five minutes total is ten minutes and then for finals matches it's twenty minutes and half the time is spent with no points so these can be very very long matches i mean to put this in a perspective a modern judo match is five minutes yeah a modern wrestling match i believe is six minutes in international freestyle so these matches can be forty minutes long now that's a long long grappling match yeah and depending on how you compete in it that can have a huge toll on your end you you can get to the finals and and just be absolutely spent so our whole thing is okay gordon's gotta not only get to the finals then he's gotta fight the toughest adcc grappler of all time after that so we were looking for quick and energy efficient matches and that meant going to the back or going to the legs and in the overwhelming majority of cases that's exactly what he did he was able to get some very very quick matches courtesy of leglock finishes and in the few cases where he didn't finish on legs then he would simply take his opponents back and that's a very low stress position to to occupy in one case his opponent deliberately kept his back on the ground to prevent the back take and they just chose mounted position instead and so he was able to go through his weight division with an extremely low energy expenditure which set him up well to go into the the finals no injuries very little energy expenditure now it sounds easy to say that you know oh okay the strategy worked but in order to get that strategy to work you have to have one hell of a set of skills and and we can see those now would you like to yeah i would love to go through them and i should also mention for people just listening to this we'll i'll try to commentate on different things we'll look at but the thing that was made clear is maybe you can speak to that maybe to you it looks like efficiency but to me it looked like gordon was not even trying there's a a relaxed aspect to the whole thing so maybe it had to do with saving energy but he made it look very easy yeah and he made the the path of submission look very easy so here the first match against an opponent that again looks bigger than him okay i'll just give an initial comment here first you you'll see that gordon elected to sit to the bottom position the hardest work in submission grappling is when two athletes take the standing position and joust for takedowns that's where most of the energy gets burned up so working on the idea of energy efficiency let's go out and we we chose to sit into guard position and then start looking to access our opponent's back because of our opponent's head position a far side arm drag makes a lot of sense gordon's able to beat the arm and quickly get behind his opponent now the question is gonna be getting into a scoring position it's too early to score at this point but we're just concerned at this stage of just energy expenditure make the other guy work harder than us so gordon did the arm drag to the back and now he's working on the hooks the hooks are not particularly important he he'll use it just to get stability on his opponent but interestingly his opponent here had an interesting strategy too which was to occupy bottom turtle position and and look to get to the critical five point demarcate sorry a five minute demarcation point where points began begin to get scored his his idea i believe i'm speculating here based on his actions was to keep gordon at bay in a defensive turtle position until a five minute mark occurred in which case he would shake gordon off walk away and force a takedown battle how many people are are comfortable in that and what do you think about the defensive turtle position versus always trying to come back to guard turtle position is the second bottom position of jiu jitsu many people only associate guard position with bottom position in jiu jitsu that's that's naive there's two there's guard position and turtle position now as a general rule guard position offers a much much greater variety of attacking options than turtle position does but that's not to say turtle position absolutely can be an effective bottom position you can work effectively from there so there's some case to be made that to wait out five minutes it would might be i mean i i personally think it it get against gordon ryan i mean i admire the fellow's courage i i it's not easy but there was a logic to what he was doing people think oh he just got his back taken so easily but the he did have a strategy now did he pick the right person to use that strategy against probably not and so gordon is able to break the turtle down get one hook in at which point are is is this becoming an extremely controlling position with gordon in the back at which point is there are you happy with where it is at this point it just started to dawn on me at this point that this guy actually had a strategy which was to maintain a a a prone position that he's in now and then shake gordon off after the five minute mark so once that became obvious then i was now i'm starting to look at the clock and how close we are if you can take it up to five minutes right now this guy's only intention is to stop gordon from strangling him and finish okay now the guy's trying to go up in vertical freeze it there now do you see how he's taking his elbows off the mat in turtle position in jiu jitsu there's only one reason you take your elbows off the mat from turtle position that's to stand up so now it's it's clear at this point what his actual strategy is it's to get up force a standing confrontation win a takedown battle and beat gordon by points so he did have a strategy now our counter strategy is always based around the power half nelson this is a common move in the sport of wrestling and it's a great way to break people down as they try to stand up gordon's so heavy yeah i mean gordon is a a master of it and so there's a power half nelson that gordon has on him as the as the elbows are off the ground and knees are off the ground he's going to return his opponent to the mat and as you can see he's successful in doing so and now it's clear what the man's strategy is so i'm calling to gordon to break him down to a hip you put a man on a hip he can't stand up gordon successfully does it traps the shoulder using that one on one grip with his right hand puts him down to a shoulder and a hip that means standing up is no longer an option for his opponent now gordon goes in he's already scoring because of the the total position that he's in his shoulders his opponent stays down on his shoulder now gordon's responsibility is start looking for the stranglehold his opponent has basic defensive structure he's disciplined with his chin keeps the chin down but gordon is a master of tying up defensive arms and penetrating under the chin to get to a strangle and you'll see that shortly there's the trapping of the arm notice that no advanced grips were required it was just a spontaneous trap there's the penetration of the neck so the arm was trapped with the leg yep so now he's he's only got one defensive arm and he's just taking that away with his left hand and he gets a one handed strangle for the finish and it looks like not much energy was expanded doing that very little yeah so that's a as the tournament got off to a very smooth start very little energy expenditure no injuries and a submission win does that there's a kind of certain look to gordon of that could be interpreted as nervousness that was an incorrect interpretation yes okay so there's a what do you interpret as nervous behavior well this is part of me is trolling but sometimes on the surface confident behavior can look like almost like anger and there's gordon's face had a like a vulnerability to it almost like when you go to judge confidence don't look at the face look at the extremities of the body yeah that's where the truth comes out you see it in body language and the further from the face and chest the more honest the body becomes look at the feet and the hands well there were i mean it was if people are nervous or not he was very relaxed in the extremities that's true see you look more confident in this this than anything what what are you thinking about what are you what what's going through your head here is this the same stuff are you are you intimidated by the the two meatheads one in a suit and tie or are you not thinking about that at all i know for me it's just about okay what's the most efficient pass to victory against this particular opponent it's just okay i've done my job i've taken them through a an extensive fight camp that prepared them for every conceivable situation that they're in i've run an efficient warm up their body temperature is perfect the elasticity in the muscles is perfect my main role when i corner is i avoid what most people do when they corner which is is to be a cheerleader most cornermen they're not cornermen they're cheerleaders they're there to express some kind of emotional support to their training partners or or their their student sometimes they're they're even worse than cheerleaders they express their own emotional fears as the match goes on i always believe that ninety nine point five percent of the job of the trainer is done the coach is done when the athlete steps their foot on the mat at that point you shouldn't need me at all everything i needed to tell you should have been not just told you but imprinted into you remember there's fifteen thousand people in that crowd for half of the match you're not gonna be hear a word that i can say there's too much noise but you'll hear my voice inside your head because you've heard it so many times over the last fourteen weeks you're sick of hearing it at that point mhmm and they're programmed know what to do so i'm i'm usually pretty confident i'm also very confident that even in worst case scenarios they're gonna have effective solutions because they train those worst case scenarios every single day in the gym and so in part you're there to have a front row seat to analyze what happened so that you can take that to the next match the biggest danger an athlete faces is tunnel vision sometimes they will hit upon a certain move or strategy and just say i'm gonna go with this when there's much easier alternatives but because they're so focused on the alternative they've chosen they get this tunnel vision and just focus only on that the most constructive thing the corner man can do is alert them to the presence of time which is very important in adcc match because they're all the scoring is structured by time and to alleviate problems associated with tunnel vision that okay you're doing this but if you just did this it'll be so much easier so that's the main goal so here this was one of several anticipated matches against the second one against victor hugo which is a very tough opponent and again this was a a situation where gordon was considerably outweighed by his opponent so the main thing here was efficiency his opponent elected to avoid the standing position by jumping into guard so close guard yeah yeah gordon would be in top position this time he has a very good close guard but unfortunately gordon has very good guard passing so he he he's an excellent guard player very talented but gordon is renowned as the imminent guard passer in the world today so it's a a tall order to hold gordon off for a ten minute match is there something you can say about this guard passing gordon is making it look very easy it's middle distance guard passing here and he eventually passes to mount i believe yes in a very again what what do you run through the sequence where he gets mounted there's there's a couple i believe he gets mounted twice there's some light just back just a little bit further yeah so he's trying one one arm under yeah this is a stacking position now normally we always insist on the idea of getting advantageous angle first controlling the feet and getting angle but there's a height advantage that victor hugo has here and the length of his legs means that he can play very very wide with his legs so getting an advantageous angle might be difficult in these circumstances it often makes sense to go right up the middle now gordon could just go back for legs because the legs victor hugo's legs are so far apart at this point that you could easily isolate a leg and attack that but gordon wanted to to show off his passing prowess very often he'll go into a match and just say okay i'm gonna i'm gonna show this skill and he'll often use it as a demonstration of techniques he teaches in in instructional videos so he wanted to show that he could pass the mount readily on a world champion like this part here this little step okay just freeze it right there go back one step okay you can clearly see that all of his opponent's defensive frames are built on his opponent's left hand side mhmm so everything is defense on the on the left but you can see this comes at a price and that price is back exposure on the right hand side you can literally see his opponent's back on that side so gordon's whole game is to to place sufficient pressure that you the opponent overcompensates on the side of pressure just to set up a quick switch across to the other side there's the vulnerability there's the back exposure his opponent has to put his back on the ground switch his back that's a world champion right there on bottom who does a good job of recovering from the first danger but unfortunately gordon has been here a thousand times and just switches his hips and kicks out little little step and so you see there's two changes in direction left right in a very short period of time that people find very very hard to keep up with now his opponent builds up to an elbow he's looking to to create more and more space from here but gordon counters by just stepping over the hips it's just when you you feel like every move he he's doing the right things the man on bottom is doing well he's doing the right things but the other guy's just been here too many times and is just a half second ahead of every decision that he made going up in the elbow man gordon makes it look so easy here with the it's it almost seems like victor's out but this turning of the hips with the arm over the opponent's back is able to bring him back down and get and gordon takes mount notice how gordon is never satisfied with the mounted position itself he's only satisfied with an extended mounted position where the elbow comes up over the shoulder line yeah only then does he show there's a there's a little bit of relief right there right right there's a little bit of relief no that's that's the look of a man who's just proved a point yeah this is very michael jordan like sticks his tongue out so yeah i mean there's no points at this stage he really is going for submission and then this this happens again is this the match that wasn't gordon was knit in the the only match where gordon didn't finish his opponent by submission was this very frustrating for him was there a it's actually interesting that when he came off the mat he was visibly frustrated he wanted to to to get a a finish and i think he was more upset about not finishing victor hugo than he was delighted by winning his two gold medals so i think that says a lot about the perfectionism of gordon ryan most people would be thrilled to beat one of the great grapplers of this generation decisively in this fashion but he was he was not happy and so this is gordon's third match against souza roosevelt souza now this is guy who's big different because now we're on to the second day your listeners should be aware that the event occurs over a two day period so the previous two matches occurred on saturday now we're into sunday now this puts a different context on things if we could just freeze it right there maybe go back one step now we're on sunday morning and the idea is that gordon will be fighting the biggest fight of his life late that afternoon so now we're into the idea of energy conservation okay it's okay to have two hard matches on on saturday because you get to rest on saturday night but now gordon has to beat two people back to back and save energy for the biggest fight of his life on sunday late sunday afternoon so now the emphasis is on a quick win and you can see gordon ryan certainly delivers on this now when you go to entangle your opponent's legs the basic choice you have is between straight ashi gurami and cross ashi gurami in the last five years cross ashigurami has proven to be statistically the more important of the two and as a result many people have forgotten the value of straight ashi gurami leg base leg locks and undervalued them gordon has outstanding heel hooks from both straight and cross positions and his opponent was probably more concerned about the danger of a cross ashigarami left the the the right leg undefended for far too long and as a result gordon goes into a very classical ashi garami you would normally expect to see from five or six years ago and gets a very very quick finish so lifts his opponent there's the ashigurami the entanglement of one of his opponent's legs with two of his now he's gotta turn and expose his opponent's heel so there's a an initial off balance to the left to get a defensive reaction the opponent overcompensates exposes his heel and then there's the submission there's a danger of a leg being broken here gordon has a absolutely ferocious outside heel hook until you felt it it's it's quite different so the the opponent probably before he even felt the heel hook felt the control and that it's yeah it's that he's screwed there he doesn't even want to yeah when someone has a someone who knows what they're doing gets a bite on your leg like that you feel it deep inside your knee and ankle tendons immediately and it's there's a sense in which you almost tap and got a a couple of taps almost almost like as if they're early because you pointed to those people came up to us obviously this guy tapped early it's like no he knew yeah yeah he knew that late would be a big problem got it so this is within within within like thirty seconds within ten seconds it was within ten seconds so this was a a excellent example of someone saying okay i'm gonna conserve energy with a short match i'm not just gonna go down into a neutral position i'm gonna directly pull into a a leglock attack from standing position you don't see that much in heavyweight divisions that's something you see more in the lightweight divisions so we gotta go to the final match of of of gordons within his division which i think as opposed to facing felipe pena who lost to nicky rod he's not rod had a a great match against felipe pena and passed felipe pena's guard i think only the second person in adcc competition to accomplish that i believe with a with a body lock it started as a body lock but he converted to half guard top head and arm and passed out of half guard top chest to chest i think i listened to craig jones' sort of interview summarizing what happened to adcc and he briefly mentioned that nicky rob might have the best body lock pass that he's ever felt so like the he's very very good with the body lock the way to face nicky rod is don't get him don't let him get the body lock but there's a problem if you if you stand up he's a good wrestler so he there's a there's a dilemma there like you have to sit down to guard but that goes into his body lock but then if you stand up now you go into his wrestling skills so it's a it's a great dilemma that he has and that that's what in in facing in facing nicky rod goran here chooses to yeah if if if you look at the limbs there's a relaxation there we should also explain some things here this is a finals match so instead of being ten minutes long it's twenty minutes long with the option of a a twenty minute overtime so this could potentially be a forty minute match so you can see why the adcc people were very concerned about gordon doing this match because what if what if this match had gone forty minutes and then an exhausted gordon ryan has to go out to fight andre galvan who's fresh and and ready to maul him and on top of that is former two former teammates who know each other's game very well well that's so there was a high likelihood in most people's minds that this would go the distance because you know when you train with each other for years every single day in the gym seven days a week you you get to know each other's tricks one big problem here for nicky rod is that his bodyguard passing game which is his main weapon on the ground was taught to him by us so it's not like we're gonna be taken by surprise by it so that that must have been figuring in his mind do you think psychologically for gordon and psychologically for nicky rod it's tough so for him with that body lock for example do you think it's tough for him to know what to do here it's tough because he would have remembered the outcome of the training sessions it's hard to go up against a guy who used to dominate you in training and then say okay i'm gonna beat him in competition can you shut all that off because it's tough man your memory is memory you you can't lie to yourself you know what do you think about competition sort of there there's been a lot of olympics bring this out there's been a lot of big upsets at the olympics there's something where people find something in in them i mean judo is a is a different sport than grappling in judo there's much more room for upset because a mistake in judo will have ramifications that will be felt within half a second like if you get if you take the wrong grip in judo you can be thrown in half a second and there's no recovery if your two shoulders hit the mat with momentum it's over it's done in jujitsu you could especially in adcc where there's no points in the first five minutes you could get taken down and mounted by your opponent and still win like you can recover from a bad start in judo boxing kickboxing mma you get hit there's no recovery time you just get swarmed on and jiu jitsu is a much more forgiving sport where you can make a series of blunders and you just recover from them you can make a series of blunders and boxing your unconscious so that that there's a blunder case but there's also been just people where it's their day i mean again maybe it's romanticizing the notion but there's been some epic performances in rest in olympic wrestling in olympic judo as an example satoshi ishii he had a two thousand eight performance we talked about all japan and all that kind of stuff but the olympics he destroyed everybody on this path to the olympic gold medal and that's when teddy rivera was also competing he got the bronze so i mean that and you could say he was at that time the best in the world also but he's some people have a say yeah but i i think it would be very fair to say he was the best in the world he think about the people he beat to win three all japan championships like he beat kosei inouye he beat keiji suzuki they were olympic champions like he was already so you don't believe humphrey will that they're no i i i don't believe that a a person can walk on stage and be better than what they are supposed to be you you have a skill level that's set in stone this is your skill level you don't just go on stage and suddenly your skill level gets here what you do have is a situation where you have a skill level okay another opponent has a higher skill level but he runs into confidence issues so that he only uses a small percentage of his actual skills and then he will fall below someone who is technically lower on the skill scale than he is that can happen but you can't just magically acquire skills yeah but by stepping on they're able to fall in confidence yes so the question becomes who manages that fall best and that can create upsets absolutely so you don't think gordon could have fallen in confidence against the former teammate when the pressure is so high there was just no basis for a fall to occur you said he doesn't have confidence issues is what do you attribute that to that's because he never loses in the gym there's there's nothing in the there's no experience that he's had that would make him say i shouldn't be this confident so it's the physical it's like like we talked about mental preparation and don't get me wrong if if gordon lost twenty matches in a row of course his confidence would drop because experience is now there's there's gonna be a psychological dissonance between his experience his recent experience and what he believes okay if you believe you're the best in the world you just lost twenty matches at some point reality is gonna break in but if you're just never losing in competition dominating people in the gym then there's nothing in your experience that would shake your confidence can i ask you this just in a small tangent why is gordon ryan so good so we're looking at you've trained a lot of special athletes you're a special human being yourself i could just look at human history there's a lot of not a lot there's some special humans it seems like gordon ryan is one of them i i totally agree with that can you try to like dissect that's what i meant when i said i had many students but only one gordon ryan like i've taught many many people but they don't all have his skill level so there's an obvious elephant in the room here okay what distinguishes him from from other athletes great question i'll try and give an answer more than anyone else that i've ever taught he has a memory for things that were taught to him he has an ability to recall information that is extraordinary compared with other people in the room so that's definitely a big part of it secondly he has a pride in technique and technical prowess that will not allow him to settle for anything less than perfection and he will hate himself when there is imperfection so there is a love of excellence and a hatred of anything less than than excellence he has an ability to pull the trigger when opportunity arises which is truly extraordinary many people know what to do but when the moment comes they back off and they'll doubt themselves if gordon sees the opportunity the trigger pulls every time so can i just just link on that quickly there's a few times where he gets a little bit of an advantage and he just chases it to get a big like with andre gavau you know you get it's like a there's a dance and you get one step ahead and he's able to chase that you know get a little glimmer of the back and he's able to chase that all the way to back control so that that is that kind of the trigger that you're referring to yes it runs deeper than that too it's the idea that good athletes are greedy athletes okay when they see a small opportunity they try and get a as big a bite of it as possible so that the mantra that we always have in training if you can see the bag you can take the bag and if gordon sees an inch of your back you know that's the direction he's gonna be going if your far shoulder is within an inch of the floor he's gonna be mounting you if your shoulder comes off the floor he'd be on your back on the other side he's a maximalist with opportunity he's not satisfied with oh let me get a good enough outcome it's like i want the maximal outcome so when you combine all these things together an ability to recall information which is just far superior to anyone else i've ever coached an ability to work in the training room towards not just good technique but excellent technique the confidence to pull the trigger whenever the opportunity arises a maximalist mindset where it's never enough to have a good enough outcome it's always gotta be the best possible outcome and the fifth element which i believe is very very important is extraordinary depth in his technical prowess in particular with regards his defensive acumen everyone looks at gordon and focuses on his offensive prowess because they see him dominate other athletes but what they don't see is what i see every day in the gym where he works from impossibly bad defensive position someone locked in on a full heel hook on his body and a full judigutami armbar in a complete pin mounted with gordon's two arms stretched out over his head in what looks like a hopeless position and gordon will work in these positions and of course because it's such a bad position sometimes he'll have to tap but he just works so relentlessly in these bad positions that when he steps on stage he's like if this guy got the worst possible position on me there's nothing he could do with it and within thirty seconds i could turn it around on him and win this match that gives his game an overall breadth and depth which is very very hard to deal with it means there's no obvious weak point where you can just say okay i'm gonna attack him here and use this strategy to to to beat him and that goes back to his confidence that the reason why most people lack confidence is because they fear bad bad outcomes okay if if you're a strong guard player you've got an excellent guard but you're terrified of leg locks and your opponent has strong leg locks you will shut down your own guard and won't play as freely and and well as you normally do because you're afraid of the leg lock danger you'll pull your feet and you'll play a very conservative guard game but if you had extremely adept leg lock defense then you just play with all the the confidence you normally do from from from guard position gordon puts himself in that situation he's so defensively sound that it translates into his offensive confidence when you talk about memory recall which is interesting i i can't help but see parallels between him and magnus carlsen who's a chess player who's the number one in the world the arguably the best ever certainly the best ever if you just look at absolute numbers the chess has the luxury of having a rating which you can't have it cannot have in jiu jitsu because it's a game of human chess chess is is just a board game so you can actually calculate the probability that you could win so he has the highest elo rating ever and he's maintained that rating he can without competing against the number two in the world he can just prove that he's the number one in the world for many years anyway there's a certain similarities one is ability to re recall so memory recall of information is fascinatingly good and the other one is not so much a love for perfection which is something you mentioned but the the flip side of that which is what you also mentioned is the hate of imperfection now in the case of magnus it almost creates a level of anxiety for him that's almost destructive so the thing he seems to hate the most is imperfection against people he knows are worse than him so the thing he loves is competing against people that are close to skill level or the favorite is people who are might actually be better than him especially in certain positions he loves competing against them he hates competing against people that are still from the perspective of everyone else what are called super grandmasters so top three in the world but he knows he's much better than them and the anxiety of being not perfect against those people that's why that's why he i don't know if you're paying attention but he stepped away he's not gonna defend his world championship because he hates the anxiety of playing people worse than him interesting he he figures they would somehow make him look bad or no he just for him the at least the language he uses it's just not fun and he likes having fun it's to him it was fun to win no matter the skill level the world championship the first time but then defending it is a very grueling process it's with classical chess you play these many hour it could be seven hour long games and on on top of that he really hates the fact that it's only i forget what it is but it's single digit number of games he says it's it's low sample so i can't i would i would like to play twenty thirty forty fifty games if we're gonna do it this way but then they're too long it's gonna take too long so he's really emphasizes the the the fun of it and the clear demonstration of who's the best now chess is an interesting game it's probably different than grappling because it's been played for centuries so there's this giant body of people that are playing it like there's other gordon ryans out there imagine a world where there's multiple gordon ryans or something like that to different dimensions but you have like sharks everywhere and so there there is fun to be had even at the very very very very top but the the memory recall is the thing that stands out and the hate of imperfection more intense than anybody else in the game fascinating that takes us back to the final ah yes so here gordon is facing nikki rod former training partner and again the intention here is this has to be put put in the context that gordon will be fighting the greatest acc grappler of all time in a few hours after this so what we're looking for is a a quick resolution still the shortest possible match now there there's a complicating factor here nicky rod was a wrestler before he was a jiu jitsu player on paper the way his route to win is via wrestling he's not gonna be able to submit gordon ryan and he's not gonna be able to pass his guard so he has to win by wrestling in the adcc finals you cannot sit to guard so the the approach that gordon used earlier that we saw on video cannot be used in the finals gordon must wrestle his opponent so on the way out gordon and i were talking and we'd had discussions obviously during the camp what's the appropriate thing to do here and there had been some matches earlier in the event where it was becoming obvious that stalling was being heavily punished by referees so i said to gordon on the way out just give him your leg let him take you down because in the first ten minutes of the finals takedowns don't score anything well there are no there are no means of scoring the first ten minutes but you can't say to god that will be that will award you a negative point so i said just let nicky rod take you down and he's like nicky rod's not gonna take the bait and i said if he doesn't they'll call him for stalling and so and and then craig jones also commented after the fact is i don't know why nicky rourke took the bait so if we see the start of the match you see gordon comes out and offers a leg now it's not that you know nicky rod is smart he knows what's happening here and what's he gonna do stall for ten minutes and get like five stalling calls put against him so gordon gives them the takedown that way they go to the ground immediately with no effort and the match now favors gordon because gordon is significantly more skilled on the ground the question is how can we make this match as short as possible and as is so often the case the answer comes back to legs so for people just listening to this gordon's in an open guard and nicky rod appears to be trying to keep his hips away from gordon's legs yes the big nicky rod knows there's a danger here so he's elected to go to his knees that will set up his favorite body lock passes and it will in some ways mitigate some of the dangers associated with leg locks so gordon's whole thing is how am i gonna get my body weight underneath him he has a choice between linear entries where he enters between his opponent's knees and circular entries where he inverts and spins underneath his opponent to get under a center of gravity is is there a way for somebody to try to get a body lock without giving gordon an opportunity to get under under them well the body lock is an excellent way to shut down leg lock injuries if you can get to the body lock but you can see gordon's very very disciplined with his elbow and knee position elbows and knees are working in a position where it's very very hard for his opponent to access his waist that shoulder's always either across the hip or in front of the shoulder sorry his knee is either in front of the shoulder or in front of the hip and we're one minute into the match and just if i were to look at the video player here it appears that the match is over soon so so i guess nikki is facing this i need to get close in order to do the the body lock and the closer you get the more danger there is to let gordon get under you and get the leg control now they're starting to get close here gordon's gonna try and get his head underneath his opponent make a circular entry into the legs he's clearing his opponent's head out of the way by faking the arm drag on the far side the first move that he used against his first opponent earlier in the tournament and there's the leg spins underneath it goes circular rotates through gets his body weight underneath his opponent getting down is gonna trip him down to the mat now i believe nick kyrat tries to pull out his foot here and craig also said that nicky rod has gotten used to be able to pull that foot out from anybody and that he was very surprised at the grip that that gordon was able to actually hold on so i just wanna comment i'm i'm just i'm just parroting commentary if you if you if you look at what's happening here from the internet just if you just freeze it you'll see that gordon like any good leg locker will always treat his opponent's foot like a knot at the end of the rope yeah just as you slide down a rope if there's a knot at the end your hand will catch yeah so too with the human leg when they go to extract by pulling you just keep your fist as close to your shoulder shoulder as possible and narrow the gap the foot will always catch the failure that many people have is they let their hand drift away from their own shoulder and so there's room for the foot to extract but you'll see gordon's extremely disciplined with thumb close to his own shoulder which creates a situation that's very very hard just to simply pull your foot out you're you're focusing on the knot of the foot yeah also it's very early in the match there's very little sweat both athletes are still pretty dry now gordon has to climb the leg and now he's already captured his opponent's shoelace there's the heel exposure coming up nicky rod already knows things are getting bad and there's the win actually the comment i made i guess was from a little bit earlier there's a earlier time where nicky raul was trying to pull out the foot and the gordon is able to hold on to the knot which which is interesting now that was a brilliant day's work by gordon ryan he said two matches against opponents considerably bigger and stronger than himself and the time of the two matches can be measured in i think less than two minutes so he's he's done what he set out to do no injuries no exhaustion he's beaten four guys back to back all of whom are excellent athletes with minimal energy expenditure and he's ready to go on to his super fight so and that's against one of the greatest arguably for a long time you know really really up there jiu jitsu practitioners competitors grappling no gi competitors of all time which is andre gevon yes andre gevon is almost certainly at this point the the greatest adcc competitor of all time he won more super fights than anyone else by a landslide so if i may just read a few words you've written on instagram about this match about andre gervau on greatness how great you become in any given endeavor will always be assessed by the degree of difficulty of the barriers you had to overcome to get to the top just as the lion became king of the jungle not by living among sheep but by dominating a world of elephants hyenas buffalo leopards crocodiles so too the greatness of an athlete will be determined not just by his own ability but by the greatness of the athletes he faces thus in his quest for greatness gordon ryan owes a debt to the greatness of his toughest opponent andre galvao and you go on to sing him praises so and that introduces this match you know there there was a interesting moment i didn't even listen to the words exchanged but because i had the great fortune of sitting next to there was this fascinating moment before the match and i can't believe goran is sufficiently relaxed to do this but he walked up to haja gracie and had a discussion what do you think you've faced haja gala before what are your suggestions and they've talked to him back and forth they brainstormed ideas like minutes before the match and it was just a beautiful moment of like i don't know like the the like tiger woods and michael jordan talking to each other something like that i mean i i wonder how much brainstorming there really was or and how much was it just kind of like spiritual inspiration or something like that yeah the i think it's more spiritual inspiration he looks after hodra as a as a hodra is a very close friend and mentor of mine so i always tell my athletes look to hojo as your example this is a guy who always fought for the finish he tried to express the the highest ideal of jiu jitsu which is control leading to submission in every match he was ever in he even lost matches on tactics against people that he could easily have defeated if he adopted a different tactic but he always insisted on victory by submission it defined his career and made him who who he was and i always try to have my athletes emulate him so what was the strategy going into this match what were you thinking what were you thinking okay for andre galvan he had there's a sense in which andre galvan had to fight literally the perfect match to win this okay this this is a match that's gonna be twenty minutes long and potentially forty minutes long andre gervont cannot win by submission gordon's submission dominance here is is just too great it would be exceedingly difficult for him to win on the ground gordon's ground positional game is just too advanced and so for andre galvan he had to win if he was going to win it was going to be in a standing wrestling exchange where most people assessed him as having a a measure of superiority over gordon ryan the problem is that it's hard to just keep a potentially forty minute match on the ground sorry off the ground that whole time it's it's very very difficult indeed so he would have had to fight literally the perfect tactical match to make it happen and he would have to do it without getting called for stalling points gordon has the luxury that if at any point they go to the ground he has complete dominance but gordon too has a problem that he can't pull guard without being penalized and if andre galvan can play this tactical game of forcing gordon to pull guard and then staying at a distance where he doesn't he's doing enough action not to get called for stalling but not so much to engage with the dangerous gordon ryan on the ground then it's feasible he could have won but it would have been as i said it it would have required the most perfect application and integration of technique and tactics that that he's capable of how much intimidation was there was there or are these assets already beyond that when you say intimidation be more precise do you think there is some degree if you're just to empathize with andre gaval do you think there's some degree in which gordon was in his head because of the trash talk leading up to certain events because of the level of dominance that gordon has shown in this competition in in months and years leading up to it also the fact that andre gevao is also a coach of a of a large team so there is some pressure to demonstrate to the team that the old line still got it yeah i can't speak for andre but i know for gordon it's hard to be intimidated when you know the other guy has no method of finishing you it's it just takes so much pressure off when you just go in there saying there's there's literally no way this guy can finish me and there's no way this guy can pin and control me i can't be finished i can't be pinned and controlled the only way i can lose this is if this guy plays a tactical game so in his best case scenario i lose by tactical by a tactical game but from andre's perspective it's like if i make one screw up this kid could finish me like it's you can see which way the intimidation game goes now for the start things get interesting here we've already said if you could just freeze it right there andre's only real realistic path to victory is standing grappling okay that would require him to take gordon down presumably multiple times after the first ten minutes and not be taken down at all by gordon so it's a tall order it's possible but difficult and here's where things get interesting i told gordon before the match just go out and offer him the leg same way you do with nicky rod and that's where things get interesting i must say that i loved what andre galvan did at the start of this match he's a little crazy here he's this is there was just so much energy in the room at this point that his hand finding got for people just listening there's there's a bit of hard slapping yeah that that that could be considered a strike it's fine it's there was just a lot of electric atmosphere in the room so now things settle down a little bit but here's where things get interesting andre throws the whole tactical game out the window right from the start he goes for the takedown gordon doesn't try to fight the takedown because it's in his interests to go to the ground but this i love this about andre he's he's literally like fuck you kid like let's see how good your ground game is yeah so he shoots the takedown and gordon accepts it obviously because it's to his advantage to accept it but i love the fact that andre was like i'm not even gonna try and stall this out i'm just gonna bang there it is so he's like okay let's see what you got kid they say you're good on the ground let's see what you fucking got and i love that about andre unfortunately he's entered the the hornet's nest now what happened there real quick because i was very gordon immediately went into ashigurami not just any ashigarami but ashigarami was holding both legs so he's in an open guard and he scooted forward oh wow that's really nice so he's against the legs now he dominates the space between the knees so there's a a guaranteed straight out shigarama here he split the knees against andre galvao like effortlessly right there wow so already gordon's in his preferred domain now so he's starting to off balance his opponent he's looking for a reaction to get heel exposure he does get heel exposure andres does a good job of monitoring the feet to try and reduce the breaking pressure but the the brute fact is it's in gordon's realm now this is this is where he has all the advantage so and the match is gonna be twenty minutes of in gordon's realm that's gonna be a very very tall order was there a moment here again going on the legs are you impressed that andre was able to get out from this i know i i would expect this andre's been preparing for this for two years and remember andre has gone against some of the greatest leglockers and grappling before and and prevailed so he's he's not naive you know he he knows how to defend himself the big problem is that he's gonna create defensive reactions which lead into other aspects of gordon's game in particular back exposure so here ashigarami goes to like a single leg type of position where gordon runs to andre's back now he has to return him to the mat the most efficient way to do so is always courtesy of foot sweeping so he pulls out a from the back to sweep him down to the mat and now gordon's on top and this is a serious problem for any grappler in the world once gordon gets top position he's just relentless but just getting andre gervais good just getting the guard back all of that is is great there's also a scene here in which gordon is pacing it too just to physically fatigue an opponent so it was passing the guard but not rushing it now what gordon's looking for here is complete chest to chest contact he's getting very close to it now and once he gets chest to chest on an opponent in top position past one of his opponent's knees it's gonna be awfully awfully difficult for an opponent to recover what is he waiting for here is the there's pressure here the the over time he just wears you out yeah it's part of a campaign of attrition of pressure over time now he's creating a situation where he's he's either gonna get back exposure or mount exposure and either way is pretty much fatal when you're dealing with gordon andre elected to to go the the route of back exposure now gordon got the body triangle he's on his back and now it's now there's one physical problem here that's that andre galvan has a a neck like a ball and he has a very short and very thick neck so penetrating under the chin for a strangle can be a a real problem he also has extremely well developed shoulders and upper arms so when the head comes down and the shoulders go up there's very little real estate to work with with regards to your strangleholds so gordon in time will trap one of his opponent's arms with his legs in order to take away one of those strong defensive arms there you can see the arm has been trapped and now he can start riding towards the strangle and now here is still difficult it's still difficult but things are looking good there's still considerable amount of time left on the clock gordon is well ahead on points so all the pressure all the tactical pressure now is on andre you'll see the critical penetration of the jaw with the right now wrist yeah wow yeah now go on the legs for a one handed strangle wow andre fought very bravely but the strangle it doesn't matter how brave you are and where where does the strangle actually happen in terms of it felt like the strangle was at the blade of the it wasn't even yeah fully sunk in yeah where so where does is that like a a full calmness like one handed there's there's a sense in which once you get underneath you know the inevitable yeah follow-up is coming again the inevitable you're feeling the inevitable it's like a to go back to your chess analogy it's like resigning in chess yeah and chess is considered almost like impolite to let let it run out when you understand yeah when you understand that death is on the horizon and there's a lot of there's a lot of respect that was the beautiful thing with all the trash talk and everything like that gordon always shows respect i i love that about the drama of combat it's trash talk in the beginning and respect at the end i think it's you know when you when you feel someone andre has great skills and when you when you grapple someone you feel just how skilled they are and it whatever issues you had prior to the match evaporate when you when you feel that okay they're just like you they do the same moves and same kind of concepts and and you see that there's more that bonds you together and separates you and that's the feeling that the end of most grappling matches so if we could talk about giancarlo who had an incredible performance and i mean there's a lot of things we can say we can probably go through his matches but if we could just talk without that about some of the most impressive things that you saw about him one of the things i think you mentioned elsewhere in here is about confidence so one of the things you saw that could really benefit him as an athlete and competitor is to build up his confidence is there can you speak to that first of all i should give you some background giancarlo badoni was a a strong local black belt in boston teaching at bernardo faria school when i would film instructional videos i would often talk to him and talk to him about his competitions and training and he would do local competitions he was trying to go from gi training which was the majority of his competitive background into no gi and he was struggling in local competitions especially with things like leg locking where he had no background in leg locking and would often get submitted so as we work together in instructional videos we we would talk and discuss how it he would periodically come to the gym in new york city and come in to work out with the guys and he often struggled in the training room he had no experience with things like body lock guard passing and this used to mean that he was many of the training sessions didn't go well for him so he was always like a a very polite well spoken young man and worked hard when we went to puerto rico and the team ended up drifting apart when we moved into austin he he said you know now that many of your athletes have left could could i come down and train with you guys full time and i was like yeah i'd love to i thought it'd be a great training partner for gordon and gary we didn't really have any training partners at that point and sure enough he'd you know he just picked up everything he had and moved down to austin now anyone who just moves halfway across the country to begin training that already gets my respect right there that's a big commitment and he began training we put him on a a training schedule where first he had to cover up his big weaknesses he had limited attacks from bottom position he had poor leglock defense and he was very very vulnerable to certain kinds of guard passing which weren't part of his experience this is all a year out from adcc yes and we should also maybe give the the spoiler which is he wins his division in a dominant fashion he also does incredibly well at the absolute anyway it it was an amazing thing to give you an idea when he first moved to austin he competed in a w a wno event and i don't think he scored a single point lost a couple of matches and and including matches to people who were in this adcc so he came out of that looking very depressed and he lost to kenan duarte he lost to mason fowler so giancarlo always struck me as someone who was positionally sound he he had like good guard retention things like this but he he had no offense he had no leglock defense and he just wasn't able to assert authority on matches he was he was a guy who was always gonna be tough to beat because it was hard to pass his guard that kind of thing but he wasn't dangerous can i ask you a question on that yeah because my interaction with him early on when he came to austin i remember he interacted with me a bunch on the mat showing me stuff but i wonder if that kindness is a detriment to the confidence is there some connection you say again confidence killers can be nice too absolutely confidence comes from skill level and confidence is a much more rational thing than most people describe it people think of confidence as like this esoteric ethereal element that you either have or you don't when in fact confidence is much more a reflection a rational reflection on your past experience and if you're successful with your past experience and you're expecting to compete in a situation which is similar to your past experience and that past experience has mostly been successful you'll be confident are you pretty confident that the sun will rise tomorrow of course you are because it's done so every time in the past now there's no as people like hume pointed out there's no supreme rational reason for for believing this but nonetheless your confidence is high and it's the same thing in jiu jitsu if if you're performing well and skills are are the reason for that your confidence will be high in the future regardless of what your mindset is so it's not a question of you know this personality does better in competition or that personality ultimately it's gonna come down to your skills and and your confidence will be a reflection of your accumulation of skills so what was this journey like to a person who lost to a person who dominated the competition yeah first things first we had to say okay you've got an obvious weakness leglock defense so every day in the gym he would be taught okay this is where you put your feet this is where you position your knees you point your knee this way not this way then he would have to start sparring situations in leg locks and have to work his way out initially these were like heartbreaking set sessions for him where i mean i've gotta give that kid full credit like he just worked his way through it patiently dealt with frustration initial failures and just said i'm going to get better can we just look around that so what's the experience of those early training sessions like from an athlete perspective it's taunting is it are you basically dealing with the rational thought that you're not going to ever be good yeah you you're wondering have i even got what it takes yeah like you you know think about it he's he's an established player who's been in ibf competition i believe he's a brown belt world champion in the ghee and suddenly a group of kids that he's never even seen before repeatedly submitting them with leg longs yeah in the gym and he's like man this this is terrible like a year from now i'm supposed to fight adcc against people like craig jones like some of the best leg lockers in the world like it it must have been hard you know but he just stayed in there and no one worked harder than him he just was in the gym three times a day studying every day and unlike so many other people every time he was shown something he consciously and deliberately tried to enact it even at the price of initial failure do you advise that that's a good way to go it's the only way to go like if you if you can't wrap your head around the idea that trying to acquire new skills will create a temporary time where your effectiveness diminishes as you're trying to bring on new skills you're never gonna make it because you'll always stay at whatever skill set you are the whole mental trick is to is to imbue this idea of delayed gratification mhmm that you have to accept that when i bring on new moves my overall effectiveness will diminish but there's the belief that in time as my skill performance increases it will increase over time but it will come at the price of initial frustration and failure and john carlo made that mental switch early on in his time in austin and to his credit just stuck through within a very short period of time it came very hard to leg lock and even the best leg lockers in the room had a hard time with them and that's that was the first step in confidence he said okay i'm not getting finished quickly anymore then he had to bring in a whole new set of upper body submissions he neglected upper body submissions when you say upper body submissions do you mean all the arm locks holds arm locks things like this and in particular he put very very hard work on his strangleholds he had always been someone who was positionally strong he could get to the back but he could never finish from the back and then suddenly in the gym he started finishing from the back and then as gym performance against the lesser students increased then you bump them up against better students and then this goes on all the way up to the best guys in the room and in time in a relatively short period of time there were significant increases in performance and success begets success and this kept going we started to get a hint of his developing confidence in local competitions i remember putting seeing giancarlo compete in a local fight to win competition against a tough brazilian kid john carlos just came out dominated and finished with a leglock now that was that was interesting he said okay you're the guy that used to get finished by leg locks and now you're beating tough opponents with leg locks and that was an important psychological step for giancarlo badoni and with each little step as we went further and further then he got to adcc trials and had one of the great performances i believe he submitted all of his opponents in adcc trials and put on a fantastic display of of grappling shockingly no one paid attention to it they were just like oh yeah he won and the john carlo flew into adcc completely under the radar they just saw him as oh he's the guy that won american trials and no one really paid much attention in his first match he took on a great brazilian champion isak and won in dominant fashion he was about to strangle with just a few seconds left on the clock and i remember john carlo being furious at the end of the match thinking like i was so close to finishing he wanted a perfect finish and up on point six to nothing yeah and still chasing still chasing yeah i mean he could've just coasted at this point but he wanted to finish every one of his opponents and he got very very close but not quite there and then in his next match he had to take on the defending gold medalist from the previous adcc yeah mateusz and yvesz this was the guy who was the favorite to win so you have a relatively unknown giancarlo fighting the man who defeated craig jones in the previous adcc what do you remember what stood out to you about this match so tedesinos is good wrestling he's good everything yes good all around grappler he's got by jiu jitsu standards he's a very strong wrestler so our intention was to match his wrestling with john carter's judo skills so you will see if we could perhaps go back you'll see the first takedown on drag and took him down with a simple dragon pick so that was john carlos first takedown that was more wrestling oriented and good for his confidence to see that he could score a nice takedown but mateusz denise is very very good at standing up from bottom position if we just go back to the stem okay now here we have something interesting mateusz comes up from bottom seizes a leg and giancarlo defends the wrestling move and then goes immediately into with the foot with a it's kind of a mix of sasai and and yashirai that was beautiful i didn't even notice that that's really nice look at that from from defending a single threatening a guillotine one of the big themes of our adcc camp was that most of our opponents now are getting very strong in hand fighting look at that but they are not strong in foot fighting and so we put a very heavy emphasis on on foot sweeping attacks you remember gordon ryan took down andre galvan with a foot sweep and here you have giancarlo using the same technique not from the back but from the front and an overhook probably in post catches the foot mid air okay and it's just a beautiful beautiful takedown that's beautiful judo and then and then later in the match you'll use a kusaragake another classical judo takedown to get top position now at one point giancarlo was in trouble he got his back exposed with this situation good double leg to to a knee pick knee pick so he has to expose his back in order to avoid giving uptake down points mhmm but here's a defensive training that we work on is is coming through he's defensively sound shuts out the hook prevents the score keeps his body at the right angle to prevent a power half nelson staying calm now he's gotta turn this around it's one of the hardest things to do in grappling how how dangerous is it to put your in this position to put your hands on the ground it's ordinarily it could be dangerous because your opponent could switch to an arm bar oops and there's the body lock now there's some controversy here but you can clearly see it the hands were locked so it shouldn't really be as controversial as people are saying now watch for the right leg here pulls in the hips exposes the leg boom and down beautiful also probably a lesson that complaining to a ref does not protect you from a good takedown yeah that's why they say in combat sports defend yourself at all times but now the the great advantage of of judo takedowns over wrestling leg tackles is they confer upper body connection after the takedown which is very very important for adcc that's why we put such a heavy emphasis on them and now john carlos is absolutely in the driver's seat he just scored four points for that takedown so he's well ahead at this point against the established favorite for the entire weight division so now mathias denise has to start taking some risks he's staring down the barrel of defeat there's not that much time left and that's what's gonna set up the the pressure now it's tactical pressure it's not physical pressure it's tactical mateus has to turn away and that's gonna create back exposure the most dangerous kind of exposure in adcc oh there it is mount quebec and giancarlo capitalizes mateusz is smart he's keeping on his side so that less than seventy five percent of his back is on the floor to deny the the mount points but that comes at a price and that price is back exposure so the thing we talked about with gordon the the circumstance of fate which is he has a lot of grueling tough matches and still chooses to do absolute so what's and he seems to just power through all of it what how much of it how much of the calculation is how to survive the cardio the grueling cardio aspect of all of this that's it's a great question and the truth of the matter is you can't afford to pace yourself because if you say i'm gonna hold myself back for this match in expectation of the others you could end up losing your first match so he didn't pace himself at all for any of the matches you have to just be in good shape and that's what they they someone at the dentist or no no it's mostly physical you've that's what the camp is for like he's felt more pressure in the training room than he felt in any of his matches but still sort of attacking look at this that was a beautiful transition with him from back or from whatever the heck that position was you're right from from looking for the back transitioning here what the heck is this transition so so mateus is engaging in a a very good tactic which is to get most of his back off the ground to deny them the mount points so as back exposure starts okay he turns in threatening an arm lock yeah but you can see what's happening here as the left foot goes under it's gonna create a beautiful triangle entry right foot penetrates through underneath the neck and now he's locking a a triangle a senkaku but not just any triangle a triangle with the the figure four locked on the back of the opponent's head which makes any kind of stacking defense very very difficult it makes it very very hard for an opponent to pull away and creates a much tighter strangle than average and as a result it's a quick submission beautifully done still chasing the submission yes with a minute left up on points against the former champion against the former champion that's match number two now that's the first day that's saturday so john carlo goes to sleep that night thinking okay i just beat a world champion in my first match and almost submitted him and i just submitted the defending champion so of course he wakes up on sunday morning feeling pretty damn good now there's an interesting twist here his opponent is a talented young irishman who won european trials i believe almost entirely with leg locks and almost all of his major attacks in the tournament so far have been leg locks now bear in mind that a year ago giancarlo was losing to local blue belt competitors via leg lock yeah so in my mind i'm thinking okay how's he gonna handle this is will the will the leg lock training kick in and you'll see the result giancarlo is is is on top passing an open guard so you can see his legs away from any attacks yes his opponent owen from ireland is employing the same tactics that we made famous years ago the idea of sitting in the butterfly garden looking to entangle the legs he's kind of playing that game so so john carter's obviously used to this from training in the gym so he's doing a good job of preventing entanglement like controlling his opponent's shoelaces and moving out to an angle which limits his opponent's entry options so hands on the shoelaces and angles is a good defense here it's an initial defense now his opponent wants to get underneath the center of gravity so giancarlo wants to get outside the the line of his legs at some point your opponent's going to entangle if he's determined to entangle at some point it's going to happen so giancarlo decides okay let's let it happen and let's see where his feet go and let's see how disciplined he is with his feet and the opponent is inverted here he does a good job getting behind giancarlo's knee so now they're fully logged in so giancarlo moves away to protect the heel rotates out controls his shoelace now at this point the irishman's starting to lose discipline with his own foot position okay he's so focused on his own attack that he's starting to get a little sloppy with his own foot position you see he's assuming oh i'm the guy who's attacking so my opponent will be afraid of my leg locks and is starting to make some small tactical errors that giancarlo will be able to take advantage of so he's threatening the sort of the north south passer like so yeah he's he's not putting too much pressure on the pass because we're still pretty early in the match and he's not ready to score yet so here again he turns away his heel now his opponent's starting to get more and more cavalier with his foot positioning to a point where now it's just downright sloppy so giancarlo sees it identifies it locks up a wrist to wrist toe hold and breaks his foot how how where's the dumb question where's the control here how is he the control comes from his opponent the entanglement is his is his opponent's ah his opponent is holding his own body in place with his own legs so he's the root of his own problem here so he got sloppy well done well done and a little smile from john carlos very nice the reason for that smile you can probably guess is because a year ago this would have been a disaster and now instead it's a guaranteed ticket to the finals in either a gold or a silver medal and so you can see in that compressed moment that's the look of a man who's made was just recognized as how much progress he's made and what was once a weakness in roughly ten months was the time it took and so he faces lucas hulk barbosa in the in the final here now these two have a history hulk has beaten giancarlo many times and so for giancarlo it's a a question of okay here i'm i'm matched up against a guy who's repeatedly beaten me how am i how am i gonna turn this around now and in terms of we talked earlier about confidence if confidence was just a mental thing giancarlo never would have won this fight when you've lost all those times to to an athlete words aren't gonna change anything but you can see right from the start when they get into the hand fight giancarlo is much more tactically adept with his hand fighting he's doing a good job of controlling his opponent's hands preventing any kind of prolonged pressure on the head and hulk gets a sense here in which he's he realized he's fighting a very different person and this goes this goes a long time again another super grueling match wrestling that eventually leads to a back take care of back triangle body triangle i apologize yeah you can see the same tactics utilized by gordon ryan back control based around the body trial many attempts to try and entrap his opponent's arm and take away those defensive arms the main difference here is again you have an athlete with a very powerful compact neck so neck penetration is difficult and so giancarlo will switch to a a palm to palm strangle instead of the conventional figure four and now there's eight minutes left so all the time in the world is it only just a matter of time at this point in in situations like this yeah giancarlo has a massive tactical lead in in points there's literally no way he could lose this match at this point even if his opponent did get out of here and take him down giancarlo would still be ahead on points so this question the the question now is not whether john carlo will get the gold medal but whether john carlo will will get it by submission and there it is there's the penetration of the neck and he can't get the figure four so he asked for palm to palm instead and there's the submission now what a journey what is john carlos is a relatively unemotional man but you can see there's there's emotion that that's not fake that's genuine and that's the emotions of a man who ten months ago couldn't have done that and then ten months later by dent of his own hard work and and dedication and his ability to to actively attack his weaknesses and turn them into strengths and then develop an ability to to to finish that that was a truly truly remarkable achievement let me ask you about gary tonin so he is one of the at least in my opinion greatest submission grapplers of all time there's a lot of components to that but he lost in his first match not only did gary lose he lost to the bottom seed of his division and that in itself says something pretty remarkable about what's happening in adcc how there's a sense in which the days of the invited athletes being far superior to the trials winners are over it was a clear signal that anyone who makes it to adcc can beat the best people sam mcnally is a very talented submission grappler from ireland he specializes mostly in armbars but he has a good positional game as well he has a very modern look to his to his jiu jitsu and he did a a fantastic job against gary tonon i think tactically gary perhaps got a little far away from his true nature in grappling which is relentless submission attack and perhaps i should be given blame for this because they put such a heavy emphasis on the in the training camp overall on positional pressure and i feel that worked very well for all of the athletes except gary tynan and interesting neigh you have to acknowledge the nature of the athlete part and i think it i was coaching so hard to the to the new people in the room on positional pressure that i neglected gary's innate ability to the fact that he does best when he attacks exclusively by submission so i think if if anyone should get blamed for the failure here it should be me there's another comment as maybe i'm over overvaluing the sort of just the physical aspect of this but it seemed like gary was looks skinny is is the weight cut difficult he this is the first time he ever went down to the sixty six kilos so you know it wasn't critical these other guys who are bigger than him who made the weight but the weight cut if you can just comment on is that does that ever play a part in the athletes the the physical and the mental aspect of the weight cut it is it is a thing like in wrestling that could break even some of the toughest minds yeah but no it it wasn't a weight cut that would break someone like gary tarnon it was it it's more physical you you you train lighter and weaker you tend to get injured more in camp because you're lighter we have a team now after the breakout that's mostly comprised of people over two hundred and fifteen pounds so there's very few small people left in the gym most of the smaller athletes went to b team so gary's been struggling a little bit with with training partners and but here i think the chief problem was that gary focused perhaps a a little too much on the positional tactical game and got away from his his true gift which is relentless hunting for submissions and and as i said i think the person to blame for that is me because i put i had to put so much emphasis on the positional game for the for the developing athletes that i didn't pay enough attention to gary's unique attributes so this i mentioned i posted some stuff on reddit so there's a relevant question here somebody on reddit asked gordon has said and perhaps you have said as well that there are two types of jiu jitsu practitioners ones who who move themselves around like marcel garcia and ones that control the motion of their opponents like gordon what are the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and how do those different approaches apply depending on which weight class you're in that's a great set of questions yes i i'm the person who promulgates this idea that there's two broad ways you can go in judo so you can either focus on promoting your own movement to create opportunity or by restricting the other person's movement if you're a slower less athletic opponent then you should definitely focus on the idea of restricting the other fellow's movement that's how slow unathletic people win in jiu jitsu if you're quick with the ability to change direction stand up quickly go down quickly and and move like a leopard then you're almost always better off generating movement in order to create opportunity so one is based more on movement as the the source of opportunity one is based more upon pressure as the source of opportunity so you'll get someone like gary toner or the ruatolla brothers their game is based around the idea of promoting their own movement to create opportunity whereas someone like gordon ryan or hodge gracie is about restricting movement and using that pressure to create reactive opportunity those are the two paths you can take in jiu jitsu because our team now has become mostly associated with people over two hundred pounds and because most of them will begin as i took the more high percentage approach of okay let's let's focus primarily on controlling the other fellow's movement and but gary is a unique individual and i feel like i let him down by not giving him special attention in in regards to to what he does the fact that you've mentioned this now like four times in the in the span of a few minutes just i love that that that all of this stuff weighs so heavy on you and he is a truly special person and it is truly interesting to see what is the nature of a particular athlete that if you highlight makes them shine let's go to the part where gary actually loses the match okay so the match is pretty innocuous at this point the guy does a good job of turning into the arm and gary gets caught reaching from the knees okay that's always a mistake and the guy does a i think does a great job capitalizing on it now there's there's limited time left on the clock this guy realizes oh this is my opportunity he's got good flexibility and he gets the hook so he just freeze it right then so there's a minute and a half left and typically in adcc if you get the the bag you you score three points so this is a huge score for gary to win here it's gotta be by submission okay so gary's made one mistake now this talented young fellow from ireland does a great job not only of getting the back but he really attacks well from the back and let's look at the depth of garitona's defensive acumen here and we should say leading up to this his defense is incredible yes keep escaping every position our nickname for gary is the slippery salmon because he's like trying to hold a goddamn salmon on the riverbank trying to hold on to this kid he's so he gets into a position which looks absolutely hopeless here it gets worse this is already bad but it's one of the most fun things about to watch about gary is the skill in the escapes it's it's incredible it's it's it's beautiful to watch so the guy has a excellent opportunity to transition off here into a rare triangle which is one of the hardest things in the world to get out of and from here if this was anyone but gary toner i think it would have been curtains but you see gary just extends keeps his arm at the just the right angle to pop out and gets out so now gary's like oh crap i'm gonna lose to this fucking guy so he's got a minute left to do something so he goes back into his submission mode he goes back to who gary tone is and immediately goes into leg lock action now the the the young man from ireland realizes hey i'm i'm gonna win this match against the number one seed so gary goes into the legs gets to one of his favorite techniques the the heel hook now gary has a brutal heel hook attack and gets real pressure on the kid's leg oh fuck it oh that's hard to watch yeah but to his credit the kid is smart he's like you know what let me he just let me take some let let me take some pain weakness to that like well he turned his hips yeah it's unclear from the video whether gary's arm slipped up there's considerable breaking pressure there oh it slipped i see yeah it's unclear even before but sometimes the heel can slip because it's because something's popped so it's unclear what happened there there seems to be a reaction from the part of the opponent like it it definitely did some damage so gary goes back for a second one oh no and again you get that same kind of pressure oh no oh right but i i i like i i like the irish kid's reaction though he's just like you know what let me eat this because i'm gonna win this match and i'm gonna be a legend for beating gary tone so i admire internal fortitude and but now gary knows he's he's lost it so it it there's a sense there in which you you see how close it gets in these situate how little there is between winner and loser and sometimes you you just get these heartbreaking situations where someone who ordinarily you would probably do very well against and you make one mistake and it's an it's an unrewarding uncompromising sport one mistake can be fatal in class you talked about escapes for arm locks and it applies here as well so you were teaching arm lock escapes and i think choke escapes and and the question came up well when should an athlete not tap and risk their arm being broken and you quoted george patton as of course you would that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country he won it by making some other bastard die for his country so what's your view on when to tap and when not not to tap in competition first off in in training you should be tapping very early because you're not getting paid to fight in the gym you're getting paid to fight on stage so be a professional in the gym tap early tap fast that way you'll you'll last a lot longer in competition things are a little different we also have to specify what is the situation okay if you're in the first round of adcc your first match you get caught i would always expect my students to tap because if you get your leg broken or your arm broken in the first round you still got three more matches before you get to the final there's a escape clause there as if you're a guy from ireland and you're fighting the number one seed there is there's always an escape clause yeah like let it snap yeah let it go but your students yes yeah i i i would expect them to tap i also think that if you're in a stranglehold it doesn't make a lot of sense in not tapping because you you're gonna pass out i i it's like you said in in chess it's kind of impolite to make the guy take it through to its conclusion so i don't see any heroism in in just letting yourself pass out now things change when you get into a final if you're in a final and you're ahead on points and you're willing to most people at that point are gonna be willing to let something break in order to win a gold medal at that point i leave it up to the student it's a deeply personal decision i would never say to a student i expect you to let your body break in order to to win a gold medal i think my students are more than mature enough to make up their own minds i would be angry if they let their bodies break in a meaningless fashion in some random tournament or in a first round match where there's no way you could go on to to the second third and fourth matches with a with a broken limb but in a final in a gold medal match in adcc i would leave the decision to them a spontaneous decision in the moment i would be confident that i had prepared them to do their very best to defend themselves but what ultimately they do is their decision and winning adcc is for a grab or at least life changing you're a world champion forever and no one can ever take that moment away from you so i would i would understand if they took a decision to take damage hopefully it will never come to that because they do a good job of preparing people to get out of situations as you saw with gary turner who was in a dreadful situation and got out within five seconds i saw him gary's been in arm locks that looked like even i was in the corner going like oh my god what is happening here and still got out so it comes down to training preparation but if they did make that decision i would understand provided it was a situation that would make their lives better and they made a calculation it's not an emotional thing now sometimes you get emotional you fight a guy you just don't like and you just don't wanna tap to him then things get a little more interesting like then again it's a personal decision if you hate someone so much that you literally can't even conceive of yourself submitting to them probably best you don't get into matches with them in the first place but if it should happen again it comes down to the student i i teach technique not morals so i i let people make their own decisions on that my thing is look don't get injured because if you're injured you can't train you can't train you can't get better so stay away from injury as much as you can so one of the other incredible stories here is as you mentioned nicholas maragali one of the incredible gi athletes in jiu jitsu world not ever having done no gi training or competition and so on in in a period of a year actually it's significantly less than a year nicholas only came about six months i believe before adcc the phone call came from gordon he was just like okay nicholas wants to come down and train he wants to move to austin yeah so he came down it was it was funny i remember the first day nicholas came in nicolas birgale as you can see he's like this tall handsome brazilian guy with a great personality and a a wonderful smile yeah also a super nice guy so he comes in he sits down on the mat and we're we're all kind of looking at the new guy and introducing ourselves and i look at him and i go buddy what the fuck are you doing here and he's like what do you mean and i go like look at you you're you're like tall and good looking you should be a fucking model not a jiu jitsu guy look at us we're all fucked up with horrible bodies and bad personalities you're like a you're like a happy good looking guy you should be surrounded by supermodels yeah what are you doing jiu jitsu for and he just laughed and he started training with us so he came in now historically he has been an athlete who always pulled guard this in in jiu jitsu parlance for your viewers in in jiu jitsu you have the option of sitting down to the ground judas was mostly performed on the on the ground you can and many athletes take advantage of this they just come out and sit to the the the ground position and completely forego takedowns nicholas did this his entire career jyutsu also has practiced both gi and no gi nicholas was a a shining light in the gi side of jiu jitsu he's one of the great champions of his era but he had not only never competed without a gi he'd never even trained without a gi so there's significant differences between the two there's a lot of overlap but there's also some very significant differences we're talking about a sport where even small differences can make a difference between a guy who gets the gold medal versus a guy who loses his first match it doesn't take a lot so this was a very very tall order yeah a lot of his attacks involve the gi from yeah absolutely guard absolutely he's in a very dangerous attack i mean he doesn't just wear the gi he really uses the gi like his ninety percent of what he's based around is based around a combination of cross and straight collar controls with with the control of the sleeve cuff and so he really actively uses the gi so when it came off his first training decisions were like oh this he looked like a fish out of water in addition he had no experience of leg locking so one of the most significant parts of the modern game he just had nothing yeah plus the wrestling he had literally zero wrestling which is half of adcc is is is based around this so adcc is like six months away and he has to get ready for the gi world championships nicholas had won many accolades in ghee judicious but he had never won the openweight division of ghee worlds so he's like the first day he's there he's like john i wanna be the first guy to win ghee open weight and adcc open weight in the same year yeah i'm like i'm like yeah now in my mind i'm thinking yeah that's it's never gonna fucking happen you fucking weirdo do you think there was a degree to which he actually believed that yes a degree he he thought it was like a certainty oh geez so he's looking at me like yeah i'm gonna do this so i'm i'm like you know well nicholas this is this is very laudable and and i i approve of your confidence and but this is a difficult goal you've set yourself yeah but perhaps maybe like two thousand and twenty four would be a more realistic way he's like no no i'm gonna do it in all seriousness it is incredible that nicholas miragali had the guts to set such a nearly impossible goal so what do you learn from this experience of setting a goal that most people would say is just unachievable and him actually almost doing it it's on the surface just absolutely crazy like when he's mentioned the goal to me i i was as i said just looking at him in almost like disbelief i didn't wanna show it on my face and yet he came within inches of actually doing it he won his first ever gold in the open weight with a gi and got to the finals and lost a tight decision in in the finals and to take a silver medal he wanted two golds he got a gold and a silver and there's a sense in which the sheer audaciousness of of of the goal set seemed ludicrous when it first happened it's it's a this is this is insanity and yet he came at it with a plan he came at it with his characteristic passion and hard work and came within inches of doing so and there's a sense in which you could look at it as oh he had a plan and it failed and yet of course no one in their right mind would look at it that that was he set an audacious goal so high that it seemed impossible and it pulled his entire performance up to a level where even failure creates something truly memorable do you encourage athletes or do you not get in their way when they set such a goal maybe even just forget athletes human nature yeah that that's a great question there's a sense in which you know you don't wanna make people delusional that that's sad but i do believe that if people are sufficiently embedded in a given project if they're committed to it to a certain degree then you can skimp on many things in life but don't skimp on your goals okay because the the bigger your goals the bigger your achievements will be and even failure as we saw in the case of nicholas muragalli you i i i almost frowned to use the word failure because if this is failure give give me more of it you know falling slightly short of full falling short of of of what would otherwise be a perfect year even that still creates such a massive uptick in your performance that it's absolutely the right way to go but there is a danger to this where people aren't committed and simply aren't working from a a framework where they can realistically achieve these things then it descends into delusion and that that that direction goes towards madness you can't have that so there has to be some kind of reality check here where you have to be physically and mentally capable to some degree of of moving towards these goals you can't just you know a random blue belt can't make audacious goals like that it's just ludicrous but with with that in mind if if you're committed and and and and you there's a sense in which this is a a definite possibility set your goals high okay make big demands yes there'll be times of frustration there'll be more failure in your lives than otherwise but even your failures will be something great something memorable see but in the near term you would be hard pressed to find any data that justifies that goal because in his case he he probably wasn't very good at no gee in the even in the training room so it's it's like where do you look for even inklings of hope we saw it in incremental progress with each successive competition that he was in his first competition he looked good but not great second competition a little better third competition took on one of the legends of american grappling and won decisively so there was a sense in which it was becoming more realistic with each outing so now now putting that inspiring philosophy aside what was the actual plan on how to make it happen so so the leg locks firstly with same thing with giancarlo first you gotta learn how to defend a leg lock so initially just like as giancarlo struggled he he struggled then he had to learn not just takedowns but just how to set up a take he had to learn basics like stance and motion and how to fight with the hands etcetera etcetera so so he had to learn from the ground up and then he had to improve he always had a very good triangle always had a very good armbar those were his two strengths coming into the the no gi training and those translate pretty well between gi and no gi but he had no guillotine he he had no strangles from the back where he has great collar strangles from the back but he really really struggled with finishing people from the back so he's he's learning all this and then he's like well now i gotta get ready for the gi so we had to switch his training to to gi training and that took out a couple of months then he got he went back briefly to brazil and got a terrible rib injury right before the world championships and came back like more or less unable to move so the world championships is a week away and he he's like john i can't move so i'm like what are you gonna do he said i'm gonna compete so i'm like are you sure so we fly to california he goes out competes his first opponent is literally the biggest man who competes in jiu jitsu he's this man is almost like four hundred pounds nicholas has got completely broken ribs we're taping up his ribs backstage before he goes out to compete he beats everyone by submission and wins for the first time the openweight a title he'd never won before he steps off the mat looks at me he goes well i got the first of them he won it key open weight and now adcc and now he can barely move he's still gone through two days of brutal competition and his ribs are completely screwed up takes a week off to try and get his ribs somewhere back in order and then begins light training building up to adcc we start putting him in no gi competition he he fights two opponents of good quality but not like world beating quality and then as his game starts improving we're getting closer and closer he's starting to develop a sense where he can wrestle confidently on his feet he's no longer easy to leg lock at all and is starting to leg lock people and he's starting to get his very strong guard passing which was based mostly around pant grips and the gi to adapt to leg no gi grips in addition he's starting to develop strong chest to chest positioning which was never really part of his game a pressure top game and so things are looking good he's matched against rafael lovato one of the great competitors of of adcc and wins a convincing victory featuring a lot of takedowns and a lot of pressure passing and people were just absolutely shocked i remember the staff of flo grappling coming and going like who is this guy he's like he's literally transformed he's like a different person so he goes into the world championships his in in his weight division he was matched with a a fellow brazilian in the first match and they had an absolute barn burning battle where at one point nicholas was picked up and slammed and then ended up winning by kimura beautiful kimura then he took on the man who ultimately wins adcc open weight division and defeats him yuri sigmoid matches yeah tough tough match now yuri sigmoid at that stage was two time gold medalist in adcc nicholas wins a very very close match against him and then fights craig jones who's one of the best leglockers in in the in the world so i think most people were expecting nicholas to get leg locked very easily by craig nicholas showed the degree to which he had improved his leg lock defense in a six month period craig never really got close to the legs and ended up becoming a takedown battle could have gone either way craig i thought did a really good job of of pacing himself he both athletes were very tired but nicholas was ahead on points and then craig hit one last takedown which set nicholas down to a hip didn't score but it was the most aggressive takedown of that last period and so nicholas got the nod and won a narrow victory yeah craig commented afterwards he said that i i really wanted the submission and he said nicholas seemed to have really wanted the submission but it ended up being a grueling match it took everything yeah like exhaustion wise everything he had it was a it was a tough tough match and they were very well matched once they figured out they couldn't submit each other it came down to their their wrestling ability neither one of them is a wrestling specialist but they're both competent in in in in wrestling and it became physically very very tough then nicholas went on to win the bronze medal in his weight division so the next day when we get called for the open weight obviously giancarlo won a gold medal the everyone agreed that he should go into open wait and did giancarlo agree of course he was he was i mean like because he didn't have an easy format you you don't order people until you you ask them no no i don't know use it as a lighter i guess the question i'm asking is how do you find the strength to then go on to absolute after because you've done a fourteen week training camp where every day was just as intense as any adcc day so you're used to it at that point no but he had very very long tough matches but he's he's used to it he's a good athlete so nicholas and giancarlo went out and giancarlo had a spectacular submission victory against his first opponent nicholas had some some firework matches and one of the toughest opponents he came up against was the brilliant tai ruatolo they had an absolute barnburner it was a very very close match and tai had had an incredible first two matches he'd beaten pedro mourinho by submission and he'd beaten the great felipe pena in a very narrow match very very tight felipe lost on a guard pole but felipe is considerably bigger and stronger than tai so for tai to to win that match even by guard polls deeply impressive it was a it was an action packed match that went back and forth very very impressive can i just get us on a small tangent yeah both of our toll brothers had an incredible performance what do you think makes them so good if you were to analyse their game sort of outside of you and use this specific match absolutely there's there's a range of factors one is that they they started the sport very very young they're probably the first example in american grappling of american students who started at age four or five most people when i began jiu jitsu started jiu jitsu as adults i was twenty eight years old when i've had my first lesson as a white belt so in time people got a little younger for example nicky ryan started when i think when he was twelve but the ruatollos started when they were literally children they had excellent coaching going all the way up through into their teenage years so they had the advantage of of starting the way so many successful athletes do as as children and going up through adulthood and with strong coaching all along the way excellent parental support so they had like a a great history where their their youth didn't show off just how long they'd been in the sport right so you're dealing with a kid who's who's nineteen years old but he's been grappling for fifteen years yeah and what counts is not your age but your met age yeah quality met yeah now they were very young in years but they were very old in met age and but there's a lot of athletes that have now as you correctly said have spent from a very early age on the mat but still these particular ones stand out it's interesting yeah no there's a lot more to it than that this is just the the first setting the scene but what really makes them stand out is that they've mastered this idea of of covering up and improving initial weaknesses while building upon strengths when the rurutolos first encountered my students they were relatively easy to leg lock because none of their training experience had prepared them for that now they were they were young at that time i believe like sixteen or seventeen and it was an obvious problem for them they both got heel hooked by my youngsters also nikki ryan and ethan crownston and you could clearly see that they identified their current weakness and made prodigious steps to improve upon it to a point now where they're winning championships with their own leg locks like i i love the fact that even as teenagers they had the maturity to say okay here's an obvious weakness let's get around this let's turn it into a strength i love the way they did that and focusing on the weakness and let that guide you to the thing you're working on but they also they they they covered up their weaknesses but they also understood what are our actual strengths now physically both of the brothers have extraordinary reach for their height they both have extraordinarily long arms for their height that means that variations of karigatama in particular dasa's anacondas are gonna be much easier for them in their weight division than for most people these are all chokes yes strangleholds so they specialize in those they adapted a game based around movement which forces opponents not with physical pressure but with tactical pressure into positions which expose them to those specialized strangleholds that they use traditionally when we when we looked at the realtors when they were young we saw that there was a disparity between their top game and their bottom game they were generally much better in top position than they were in bottom position again they saw that as a as a potential weakness and they turned it around using again their unique long limbs relative to their height and they make use of a buggy strangle i'm not sure why it's referred to as a buggy strangle but it's in it but basically it's a variation of karigatama using the legs done from disadvantageous positions on bottom mhmm and they both make brilliant use of that to not so much as a strangle weapon occasionally they'll strangle some of it but they mostly use it to create pressure to make people back off mhmm and as a result they're able to they overcame the disparity between their top game and their bottom game now their bottom game is part of their offense and they're very very successful from there and so again you had that that really impressive sense in which they identified their weaknesses and leg locks and bottom position turned it around and made it into strengths and at the same time they identified okay what what are our physical gifts and how can we maximize their use and they created a program of initiating movement that created tactical rather than physical pressure to set up their best strangleholds i deeply admire what they've done that's two two young men have a huge future ahead of them and so here one of the brothers faces in the in the absolute nicholas murgalli and bear in mind tai tai has just fought two very tough matches against guys bigger and stronger than himself so he's coming into a third match against a third guy who's also bigger than he is so hats off to tai fighting open weight against three monsters in a row now tai and cade one of their best attributes is they are two of the best scramblers in the sport of jujitsu so whenever you go to shoot on the legs with them there's a danger of running straight into a dash stranglehold they're very competent at counterattacking single legs with dash strangles it's also very hard to control them after a takedown they do a very good job of springing back up to the feet so i told nicholas to favor upper body judo based takedowns rather than wrestling takedowns and you see here a fine example of nicholas's gathering skill in uchimata one of the great throes of of judah set up with a there's a bit of a foot on a foot sweep like good the nice thing is he starts off with what it looks like it says actually a two directional uchimaru he threatens uchigari to the back that's a throw that throws your opponent to the back his opponent pushes into him then he changes direction with a support foot and takes him over with uchimata now as we said earlier the great advantage of judo over wrestling is that because there's upper body connection during the throw and after the throw it's much harder for an opponent to scramble away from you and even tai ruto is one of the best scramblers in the sport has to stop scrambling here and just go back to guard position and and enable nicholas to to hold top position i mean some of it is also the surprise there is something less understandable about judo techniques because there's less data it feels like the the rules holders also have a good intramada they i think they're very familiar with it it's just do you how often do you think are are they on the receiving end of intramada that's a good point yeah yeah so i just feel like they have more data in terms of defending would i mean of course there is fundamentals to the hijamada that make it difficult to scramble around but this is a good example of someone who literally didn't have a single takedown six months ago now he's throwing one of the toughest guys in the sport with one of the more difficult throws of judo now you're a judo man yeah you'll back me up and say uchimaru is not an easy throw to learn yeah it takes some time you're hopping on one foot with both of your body weight supported on one foot yeah it's one of the really it's one of the more difficult throws let go of your understanding of takedowns of maybe wrestling style takedowns or more intuitive kind of takedowns to understand it there's many throws like this uchigari is like this uchigari is like this uchimada is like this it's weird what i'm on one foot i'm hopping around this makes no sense yeah but it works foot sweeps are also weird in that way they're a little bit more intuitive but like to get very good at foot sweeps you have to understand timing weight distribution there it's a it's a dynamic thing that's weird you have to i always laugh when i talk to nicholas i say you know i i try to teach him a a single leg which is traditionally most you know like a high single leg is one of the easier takedowns to perform in terms of mechanical difficulty and nicholas always struggles with it and then i teach him one of the more difficult takedowns huachimata and he does it flawless yeah you you never know certain things get attached i mean you see this in judo it's kinda interesting to see there's classes of takedowns and certain people just gravitate in their philosophical intuitive understanding of body mechanics or something like this it's like seinagi versus ichimada you very clearly see there's some people that understand they like to have both their feet planted on the ground and there's some people that are okay with this one foot on the ground and the other one is doing something else and i think that i don't know what that what is that i don't know it's what makes you fall in love with one field versus another so what can you speak to that that you you know you've released a new instructional takedowns and standing skills for jiu jitsu just at a high level using nicholas as an example what are some key ideas about takedowns okay first whenever people talk about standing position as you do they will say oh i need to learn some takedowns but it's never a question of just learning the takedowns it's learning the prerequisites to the takedowns the takedowns are more or less like an afterthought you've got to begin with stance motion the ability to engage in grip and contact get your opponent out of balance and then comes the the takedowns the takedowns in jiu jitsu are mostly divided into lower body takedowns tackles to the legs single legs double legs to a lesser degree high crotch in jiu jitsu and then upper body takedowns which are mostly judo derived nicholas had to start more or less at the ground i mean he didn't even know how to come out and make grips or hold a stance so he had to learn every element of it and the fact he was able to do so in six months is just incredible can you comment on the upward posture mhmm that seems to work for jiu jitsu the matches in jiu jitsu are much longer than the matches in wrestling in addition there are many kinds of submission threat which are not there in wrestling so the stance has to be significantly changed in wrestling they favor generally a very low crouch because the vast majority of attacks are tackles to the legs so anyone who stands upright in wrestling tends to get heavily punished by being taken down immediately with a leg tackle in jiu jitsu the matches are so much longer it would be difficult in a forty minute match for example to maintain a a bento or a crouch you'd be exhausted there's also problems associated with submission holds there are many forms of submission hold guillotines dashes etcetera or if your head comes down too low you become a little vulnerable to this and so the the stances in jiu jitsu competition tend to be much more upright more like judo and greco so right off the bat you see the stance is different the motion tends to be much slower and more evenly paced because you gotta be able to do this for long periods of time so the the number of fakes per minute the number of shots attempted to per minute is is usually much lower so these are obvious differences the biggest difference however has nothing to do with that it has to do with tactics in jiu jitsu the scores will be judged by what happens after the takedown in the case of adcc you can take someone down in ways that would score in both wrestling and judo and possibly even win the match in the case of judo and it would score zero in adcc because of the the nature of the rules the whole idea of adcc scoring is to demonstrate control after the takedown it's what happens in the critical three seconds after the takedown that creates the score in judo and in wrestling the emphasis is placed on the takedown itself in jujitsu the emphasis is placed on the aftermath of the takedown that's where the score is allocated and that can be a period of up to three seconds now three seconds doesn't sound like much but in a scramble after a takedown three seconds is a fucking eternity it goes on forever and so you will see many examples of takedowns that as i said would score very well in in judo and and wrestling but don't score at all on adcc and so the whole skill becomes packaging the standing position in terms of the takedowns themselves but in particular preparing the athletes for that critical three seconds after the takedown that's why many people who are very fine wrestlers struggle in adcc they take people down by wrestling metric all the time but don't score under adcc rules what makes gsb so good at takedowns i've gotten just to even recently watch him do takedowns is it within this framework that you you're teaching what stands out to you about him that you draw lessons from yeah that's another example of someone who's performing takedowns in a rule set radically different from wrestling just as the adcc rule set is so different from conventional wrestling rule sets that the whole manner in which you approach takedowns and even your understanding of takedowns has to be quite strongly modified so to an mma it's even more extreme people always think oh this guy's a good wrestler he should be able to get takedowns in mma easily what you find is that the wrestling skills in mma enable you to finish takedowns if you get in on your opponent and get through the legs or the waist or what have you your wrestling skill will enable you to finish the takedown but getting to the takedown is massively different in the context of mma than it is in wrestling the entire stance is different the entire set of distancing is different there's the idea of positioning within a cage like how close you are to the the the perimeter of the of the cage changes radically how you approach the takedown the setups are literally night and day different it's the setups are almost entirely composed of striking setups rather than grappling setups and so the act of getting to the takedown is like a completely different sport now george studied wrestling and used to go to wrestling practice twice a week in canada they do freestyle wrestling they don't use the american college style of wrestling now george's main emphasis in wrestling training was takedowns obviously the whole ground element of of freestyle wrestling was of no interest to him like learning how to put people's back on the ground and turn them with leg laces and gut wrenches was of no value in mma so he devoted almost all of his study to just the act of taking someone down so as in pure wrestling george is is not bad i think he would be a very competitive match even for a highly ranked american freestyle wrestler obviously he would lose easily on the ground because he's not used to the partier he'd probably be leg laced or or gut wrench quite easily by a skilled opponent but in just a pure takedown battle he'd be a competitive training partner for even a good wrestler but in actual mma competition he could take down even the most highly credentialed wrestlers and in some cases it'll make it look almost effortless and that came from his unification of striking skill with wrestling so he used wrestling skills to finish the takedown and his karate and and boxing kickboxing pedigree to enter into the takedown now when he initiated the study of this this is at a time when mma was pretty much in its infancy and he was one of the most impressive people i've ever seen in this regard he was a true innovator he innovated this specialized area of striking to a takedown to a greater degree than anyone else i'm aware of well let me ask you about this innovation because you're one of the most innovative people in in martial arts there's several major categories of innovation that that you have led obviously leg locks body lock now wrestling what's your process of innovation so seeing the problems in a particular system the the gaps how do you identify them and how do you figure out systems of how to fill those gaps first thing i look for is what are the current weaknesses in a given combat sport so in the case of jiu jitsu it was very obvious that historically jiu jitsu had always been weak in leg locking judas had always been weak in standing position overall and these were things that needed to be sorted out immediately in its infancy mixed martial arts was divided between grapplers and strikers strikers and most of the emphasis in early mixed martial arts was on the idea of specialists in a given domain forcing the fight into their domain and that my early work with george saint pierre convinced me that the right approach wasn't increased specialization and learning to force your athlete into that area of specialization at the expense of the opponent but rather the the real battles of the future would be won and lost not with techniques per se specialized techniques but rather the integration of techniques and the overlap between the various grappling and striking skills so that someone who was an inferior grappler would have just enough grappling skills to be able to hold a grappler off and then defeat them with striking and a striker who was if you went to fight someone who's superior to you in striking you would have just enough striking skill to be able to hold them at bay and then enter into grappling this went further and further until it got clear that there were whole areas of the sport that needed you need to change your entire mindset about them so that people went into early mma thinking in terms of grappler and striker what i started to think is in terms of okay there there are four fundamental skill areas of mixed martial arts there is shoot boxing which is the integration of takedowns and and and striking there is clinch boxing which is the integration of upper body clinch skills combined with striking there is fence boxing which the two athletes are locked up with each other on the fence and they have to integrate take down take down defense and striking skills and there was grapple boxing which is the merging of ground grappling with striking and when you broke mma down into those four categories you saw that each one of those four domains transcends the specialized martial arts that form their components so for example in in clinch boxing you would incorporate things from judo greco roman freestyle jiu jitsu submissions muay thai punching techniques but even if you took all five of those the rule set that you're operating in required such extensive modification that the final product of clinch boxing transcended all five of its component martial arts and became its own autonomous skill needed to be worked autonomously and when we broke george's training down into those four areas that's when real progress started to be made that's when you started to see the integration of those four phases and the striking and grappling within each of them was where victory was being won and and and lost so once you reframe how you see a particular combat sport then you could start doing these detailed development of ideas that actually like they they fit there's a sense in which that it had to start with a paradigm shift yeah and then a research program began after that you don't start with research you started with a paradigm shift and then went to research well let me ask you i got a chance to hang out with you and henzo gracie at adcc he keeps messaging me saying he's gonna call me and not call on me i think aside from being hilarious charismatic and handsome he is also and wise for his young age he's also one of the greatest coaches and athletes of all time in martial arts so let me ask what have you learned about life from hensel gracie the degree of difficulty that henzo must have encountered he never talked to us to us about it because but i figured this out as the years went by the degree of difficulty that he must have experienced when he first came to manhattan and started teaching it must have just been incredible you gotta remember henzo came from brazil training with the best people in the world at that time you know hixson all the machados all of them were located around gracie baja and that rio de rio de janeiro set they all knew each other and they all trained together they had internal problems of course and but they all knew each other well and knew each other's games so they all of them had beautiful and highly developed jiu jitsu so all henzo knew from childhood on was perfect beautiful jiu jitsu and communicating with other people who also knew perfect beautiful jiu jitsu then he comes to new york yeah where he has to teach in a language that he at that stage barely spoke yeah to a bunch of fucking morons yeah who didn't even on my first day in jiu jitsu they had to explain to me the difference between the mount and the guard mhmm because as far as i was concerned hey you're on top it's the same thing yeah and they're like no no no mounted is different from god and i'm like no it's not like you're on top of the guy you just hit him so he has to argue with you about and imagine going from training with with hicks and gracie to having to tell some moron that god is different from mount and we was we were so primitive back then it he went from the best training culture in the world to literally the worst just a bunch of guys in their mid twenties who knew nothing about the ground just well luckily he's the first patient but but but but out of that he molded one of the greatest gyms ever in new york yes he had he did a fantastic job and most of it was based around the idea that he gave us complete freedom we came in we trained all day and i started teaching beginners classes and then some of his senior students ricardo omeda rodrigo gracie and matt serra opened their own schools around the tristate area so they left there was a vacuum of teachers and he asked me to start teaching i taught for for many many years there and he always gave us complete freedom his only thing was to say okay do whatever you want just make sure it's effective prove to me it's effective yeah and that's the best research program you can ever get you know show me proof and you know so many times especially in those days in jiu jitsu there were so many things that were just off limits like you couldn't study legos you couldn't do this you couldn't do that like this kind of game was for cowards this kinda this is the only kind of game we accept and henzo was never like that he was just like okay just do what you want prove to me it works and if you give people that simple structure you give them some time some ingenuity a lot of things can happen i gotta ask you and by the way he'll come on this podcast and i do feel like it's a little bit like riding a dragon or a bull some kind it'll be it'll be a fun journey there's i can't at least from my perspective having interacted and having met him it's hard not to smile from his stories one of the most charismatic people in jiu jitsu it's kinda fun to watch that humans can be like this too it's it's just the the the love that radiates from him is is incredible i gotta ask you this is from reddit there's there's a there's a few legends that come from that gym but people on reddit kept asking me about some guy named boris apparently you coached him at henzo's and he was a legend and he was terrifyingly good what made him a legend who's this boris character boris is one of my early students one i think he was either my first or second black belt boris came from long island he was a wrestler he was of russian jewish descent and highly intelligent and now he was short of stature but very powerfully built in compact very nice polite young man but also slightly eccentric which i i always liked about him he he would always come dressed with glasses on and he would leave the gym dressed like to use the american phrase a complete nerd mhmm with like his pocket protector and and he now he was heavily muscled but he would dress in such a way that he didn't appear so when he left and we always used to laugh like you imagine some guy tried to mug boris they would see him with his with his nerdy glasses on his pocket protector and they would literally run into like one of the most formidable human beings in the entire new york area boris started training jiu jitsu i believe in long island and then when he got a tech job in manhattan started training with us in a morning class now these were relatively early days in manhattan and in my teaching career and he and a group of others a very small group used to train early in the morning around six am before work and boris was a legend in those days now a very young georges saint pierre came to train with with us at that time and he would come in at six am to his morning class and he was one of the main training partners for for boris and boris being a wrestler i used to generally prefer top position mhmm and i would always encourage george to play bottom position i said you gotta get good in bottom position you never know i know you're good at takedowns but one day someone's gonna put you down so you gotta work bottom position and boris had very strong guard passing i remember one of george's happiest days is finally after like two years one day he swept boris got on top and finished them and i remember he was that was one of his biggest thrills in all of his his his training career that was the last time that ever happened boris no boris was he was a very formal man for that time the funny thing about boris is every time we would have a conversation he would say i'm only gonna do this sport until i'm forty years old and then i'm gonna stop and i was like why like why not be like a lifelong martial artist you know you got so good you're you're good at jiu jitsu you've got great skills you've worked hard why not just keep going he's like it's ridiculous for a man to train after forty there's no need and you could never give any reason for this it was just ridiculous so one day he now this is a guy who came in literally every day six am every day one day he comes in he comes up to me at the end of training he goes hey john i just turned forty so i won't be seeing you again and i thought that he's he's joking so i'm like i'll see you tomorrow boris he's like no you won't and walks off how gangster is that and then he never came back i've never seen boris since he came in was one of the best crappers i ever saw and just said that's it buddy i'm out and to this day when to walk away yeah i also got to hang out got to meet hang out with ali abdulaziz he's a hensel gracie black belt fourth degree judo black belt and friend and manager of of khabib nurmagomedov who's coming down to austin soon we'll do a podcast hopefully you get on the mat and have have a bit of brainstorm also he's a manager and friend of many other amazing fighters i really love the guy the loyalty the the fact that he he he looks for loyalty and has that inner close inner circle and integrity and character and people i really like them i connect them really quickly but any any fun stories about ali did you train together yes he trained for many years in the in the basement of my classes he's his his story is one of the most unlikely stories like if if someone wrote a movie plot about his life they'd be like this is absurd it'd be thrown out the door in a in a second and yet it all happened you're absolutely correct he he's from the unlikeliest possible starts created a situation where he's i think it's incontestable now to say he's the most successful manager in mixed martial arts history he has more champions under his care than than anyone else i've i'm aware of and respected and yeah influential so on all on all dimensions yes now many people aren't aware of the fact that he was actually a very good judo player he had judoka first yeah yes yeah he had very good nogi judo he had an excellent harai goshi very good tani etoshi and he threw many people who were highly credentialed wrestler wrestlers in back in the basement back in the glory days of mma training he was a good example of a guy who had very very good judo hips and often used it to to counter wrestling and was a fine demonstrator of the idea that when judo is adapted to no gi gripping it can provide a very effective foil to many of the standard forms of wrestling attack and he would often use uchimara to counter leg tackles and do so in very very spectacular fashion well what do you think about khabib is there something from just watching him or is there something you can imagine if he comes down to the gym that you might learn from the way he moves the way he approaches wrestling oh oh absolutely he's one of the greatest combat athletes of all time if you can't learn from someone like that there's something wrong with you so he emphasizes control mhmm yes he does and he's absolutely a master of exerting control the amount of grappling control he was able to put over some of the most difficult people in the world to control was truly astounding he he beat people from every style he beat wrestlers he beat jiu jitsu players he beat kickboxers and he controlled them all in more or less the same way he has a very underrated bottom game people think oh he's just about stifling top control but people forget he was taken down on several occasions and ended up in bottom position and he showed excellent guard work from bottom he was able to get into submission holds readily on opponents from bottom position he's got an excellent bottom game he people say oh he's just a positional guy no he's not he's got great submissions okay the application of his triangle from both top and bottom was top class he had a sharp arm lock from bottom position excellent kimura if you look at his kimura finishes in mma they were technically very very well set excellent breaking mechanics he's a very very fine grappler in both submission grappling and mma grappling i think we'd probably learn a ton from from moving around with him is it possible to learn something about him or about haja gracie or about gordon by watching them or rolling around them for a little bit so maybe hager and and khabib is are good examples because they're able to do seemingly very basic things on everybody and dominate them with that i think gordon is as well but gordon seems to have more preference and range of what he's able to do it's just it's almost miraculous how much hodger can do by just like the same exact thing and everybody is that like is it possible to understand why hajar or khabib were so good at very basic positions or do you have to feel it or do you have to or is it just something that's developed over years or years or years for most people for the vast majority of people it would have to be explained to them for a smaller group of people if they felt it they could try to replicate it yeah and there are a few people who could look at it and have enough knowledge and say okay i can see what he's doing like for example hodger could probably look at video footage it could be grappling and say okay i understand what he's doing but the average person it would probably go over their heads you sometimes think of like these great athletes like maybe they're too narrow like you you you might imagine they're kinda so focused on a particular thing they don't develop in interesting ways he's he's just a sweetheart yeah no he's a he's a wonderful person to be around yeah he'll he'll he's also visit visiting austin but just i was so i mean first of all i'm honored just drinking a little bit too much in vegas with hadra gracie and just and talking about love and relationships and life and and death and all those philosophical topics as one does in vegas i have a little bit too much to drink anyway after adcc it was beautiful and on top of that hanging out with rogan many days for ufc and then the adcc you know one thing i don't know if you got any chance to hang out with with joe when he plays pool i so i spent a lot of time with him when he was playing pool like recently on that trip to vegas and there's something zen like about first of all just watching him but i've never seen the focus the guys got on the game for hours just deep focus unshakable focus that was so interesting to watch that this human being he's a celebrity he does all kinds of stuff that he's able to to allocate as close to a hundred percent of his mind as i can imagine to a particular task and nothing can distract him that was really inspiring that you could still do that on any task well paul is a game of physics that should be your domain oh it is but that that wasn't just physics yeah i would think you understand the game you understand the physics of it you also understand the the fun of it because there's friends and laughter and so on i would be distracted by that a little bit i wouldn't be as not a joke he at the he literally as the closer you get to the table the more it's everything zooms in the jokes there's funny things you can't get his attention on anything it's that focus i don't know that stays that really stuck with stayed with me that like you know those memes like i i wanna find somebody that looks at me the way x looks at y i wanna find somebody that looks at me the way joe looks at a pool cue or whatever it it the focus there i wanna find something in my life rather i want to attain the level of focus he has for pool on a task that i care about and that that focus like fuck everything else this is now it's time to do work i don't know that was really inspiring i haven't seen that kind of focus for prolonged periods of times on a task mhmm you you just need some time the guy the guy is i mean part of it is just being competitive with himself it's the hatred of imperfection all those kinds of elements but embodied in a singular focus which no idea he even played paul it's interesting you he should we should watch him he he won't i think it it could be one of his greatest obsessions like there was deep see i thought pool is for like degenerates like gamblers and like hustlers right like the same way i see poker but like i saw like a wolf slash like elite athlete in joe i said i didn't know this i don't know much about pool i didn't know that you could have that level of focus while still drunk out your ass but extremely focused it was beautiful to see i don't know inspiring inspiring for me as a person who highly values singular focus on a task let me ask you from a perspective of a hobbyist what major practical changes can a hobbyist who works regular nine to five job do to improve their jiu jitsu so they're in a gym there's a lot of excellent gyms throughout the united states what can they do to improve their jiu jitsu about their about the way they think about jiu jitsu about the way they approach their actual schedule those kinds of things that's a great question okay the less training time you've got the more you wanna maximize its effect so a question becomes okay if i'm training say twice a week and sometimes even once a week what can i do to make sure that that two hour period is used maximally the less training time you've got the more the onus is on you to have a plan before you walk in the door if you go in to saying i'm gonna roll around and see what happens or i'll just follow what the instructor says you'll get a certain amount out of each class but it will never be what it could have been go in with a plan and enact it many people go in with a plan and don't follow it let's say for example we start with a program that goes like this first try to create the most honest assessment of yourself as a jiu jitsu player it's tough to make an honest assessment of yourself because you never actually get to see your game so what i would recommend is to start by videotaping yourself inspiring with your peers that's fascinating because we don't even have that level of introspection ability to reflect of what we actually look like in grappling start with an assessment of yourself and the most honest one comes not from you comes from the camera have a look at what you see and start to say okay many of the weaknesses in your game are made much more apparent by looking from the outside in rather than feeling them during the heat of a match identify four or five of the biggest weaknesses that you see and start actively attacking those weaknesses ask yourself let's say for example in the course of watching the video tip of yourself you observe yourself losing three triangles you attempted three triangle strangleholds you failed all three you could start by saying okay let me ask myself who are the people i look up to the most with regards a triangle strangle who's the guys who have the best triangle strangles out there then ask yourselves of those people who are the ones whose body type and personality most closely mirrors my own and that would be a good example of of taking a problem in your game contrasting it with elite level performance of in people whose body type roughly matches your own and then try to take lessons you learn by observing the best people and bringing them into your own game in one specific area as time goes by you do this with more and more elements of your game you will undoubtedly improve you will also have to make sure that you take time during class to actively work on these things now sometimes in class you don't get a choice the instructor sometimes says okay today we're working this this and this but there's always time after and before class where you can do your own drilling where you can make your own inquiries and during sparring there's no rigorous control over what you do you can try to work the game into the areas of of focus so for example if you want to work on front triangles it would be wise for you to do most of your sparring from bottom guard positions it'll give you the most opportunity and in this sense it always begins with an accurate assessment of your current skill level you've got to start there then i i always encourage people to use a video camera to make the most honest honest appraisal you can yeah because your own mind is not dishonest but it's understandably inaccurate you tend to feel things rather than see them when you're performing jiu jitsu then make a program for yourself based around what you see as excellence look at the people in the sport whose in in the area you wanna work on people who are renowned for skill in that area if possible narrow it down to people who have excellence in that area and their body type corresponds with your own and then try to take lessons learned from observing the excellence in these elite athletes and bring elements of them into your game never try to bring an elite athlete's entire game to your game that will create an inauthentic game on your part which will always be a poor copy of what you're trying to watch rather bring very specific areas and skills that you see and import them from different people until eventually you find something for yourself experiment a lot okay everyone's different and so you will don't see the video research as the final word see video research the way a writer will see a muse as some someone who initiates discussion opens inquiries for your own research the most powerful moments you will have on the mat come from making discoveries for yourself not being told what to do not observing someone else doing something but self discoveries those are the ones that will last inside you so use video research not as the definitive answer to your problems but as initiating research for yourself on the mat and as time goes by and you do this more and more often in more and more areas of the sport i promise you you'll improve yeah and i i guess when you have the plan have a plan that carries across many training sessions so i just remember i i know this is perhaps dumb but i i saw in my own game early on a lot of growth it's by self identifying a problem and coming up by myself with a solution by watching in that case marcel garcia i just thought my butterfly guard was very weak and so i thought okay what's the solution here i i thought maybe this x guard thing double x guard okay so i watched a bunch of video let me try to work on this and then all i did just this is self but when i could get time by myself meaning like not instructor guided classes but in training i would just every everything i would put myself into butterfly in asgard that's good and then just let go like don't progress sweep and figure out a way to get swept to get right back to it back to and everything it it was annoying probably to train with me because that's all i did and it's all i thought about i bet you learned quickly yeah i learned it's the most progress i've ever made now you could say that xguard wasn't the right solution for me that maybe that wasn't the weakest point for me to work on if i were to look back now it's still to this day sadly the the weak the obvious weakest point of for me is escapes from much worse positions that that should be worked on that should have been worked on from the very beginning that's still today if i were to say what's the weakest thing that i should work on absolutely is even even with one day a week is escapes but yeah the a lot of that has to do with just carrying like focusing on the one thing over and over and over and over across training sessions now it also i would write down on a sheet of paper the number of times i would get a x card sweep and yeah i would set a rule that i have to get whatever it was like five hundred sweeps a week so i have to and then like the closer you get to the end of the week the more you like just pick up a small wipe up hundred in a week yeah sometimes your training partner is my suck bro yeah no well no you start with with good ones and then you get more and more desperate you start like finding the the kid right that you could just sweep over and over but like that number for me the numbers for some reason were like it set a goal to pull off a technique it it enforced like we're staying with this for a while this is a journey we're doing and then for some reason for me that helped me focus the study to understand the deep complexities of this thing that at least for me other people like nobody at the gym was doing xguard or any of that so you had to kinda figure everything out yourself i'm sure there's there's better ways to do that but at least that focus helps from a hobbyist perspective what's the day what's the perfect day in the life of john donner if we're talking about a basic non adcc now you're i'm really grateful that you sit down with me on a sunday late at night but it all starts again for you tomorrow so three training sessions a day what what time do you wake up do you do like a mantra in the morning do do you listen to like some zen music what do you eat in the morning what what what's the perfect day look like when you sacrifice a small animal yeah to the gods i i usually when you say a perfect day what i think you really mean is an average day perfectly productive average day yeah so is is let let's take monday morning we're for you watching this video we're we're filming this late on a sunday night so after this i'll drive home we just had adcc it was two weeks ago it was one of the longest training camps it was the longest training camp i've ever run because of the fact that we had to go through three different matches for gordon ryan leading up to it so immediately after adcc i cut the training down for the competitive athletes to one session per day for the first week after adcc to give their bodies a bit of a break i still have to teach two classes in addition to that two recreational classes so my teaching schedule went down to three classes per day after one week of relative break we go back to two competition classes per day plus two recreational classes plus an mma class for gary toner and his friends the first class requires me to get up around six am to drive i'm still a student driver so i'm i'm not very good at destination on time just just for the record john pull pulled in in a in a red lamborghini with a no you're the worst liar i ever met my day typically starts pretty early i don't eat in the morning i just get up and go to work and i teach through the day my last class finishes usually around eight pm during that time i coached jiu jitsu i try to find time for one instagram post per day which usually describes some basic theme of jiu jitsu in most cases unless we've just had a competition in which case i'll talk about upcoming competitions or what happens after a competition but most of them just express a a simple jiu jitsu theme i try to do a a short workout for myself and then i go home at the end of the day i always start by asking myself what do my students need from me tomorrow based on what i've seen today what do the recreational students need and what do the competitive students need this is always done in the light of what are the upcoming competitions but throughout the day you're doing a lot of really in-depth classes so how do you either prepare for them or think through them as they're happening think through the material that you're teaching i can look at a class i've been doing this a long time so i can just look at a class and be like okay these guys need this this and this and then i make reflections at the end of the day then i'll take care of things that we all do talk to family occasionally go out on for dinner with friends dates things like that yeah hensel had to really harass you to drag you out and to hang out and he was very convincing and food wise i eat once a day eat once a day yeah at the end of the day i usually stop off at a place like a a supermarket like whole foods or some equivalent to that and buy something simple and eat the internet wants to know the details did you end up getting wi fi for your apartment no i was i'm still thinking about it it's still yeah yeah so what are the pros and cons there's no cons lots of pros but i just don't put much importance to it things that are unimportant i just ignore yeah there's a lot of things in life that have a lot of pros but like they're lower on the priority list why why because the five g already five g's got it covered do you watch much video do you watch video do you watch footage video footage quite often yeah i i especially things from freestyle wrestling rego roman wrestling judo and mixed martial arts also subsidiary sports to mixed martial arts like boxing muay thai and european kickboxing just for long term idea generation yes like it plants a seed what could yeah this is an interesting thing how could this be incorporated in the context in which we use it mma or jiu jitsu as maybe it's immediately obvious or it might become obvious in in a in a few weeks or months is there some aspect to the way you approach life and training and martial arts that amends itself to minimalism it it seems like you live a pretty stoic life uh-huh or is that just a symptom of focus existing you know my my life wasn't always like this i've gone through different phases in my life i was a a university student and teacher at university i was a nightclub bouncer for more than a decade i've been through different areas of life i've seen most things i've experienced a lot i've traveled the world at this point in my life people think i live some kind of like monk like existence but you know i have a private life i like to go out and have fun like everyone else i i'm not like some kind of like monk who just you know sits under a waterfall and meditates or anything crazy like that well that's that's what i'm i'm currently going through that stage of my life the monk like existence so i would be amiss not to ask you one of the most important questions one can possibly ask john donahue which is on the topic of animal combat who wins in a fight to the death or maybe a a in a sport competition setting but let's go with the fight to the death a grizzly bear a silverback gorilla and maybe a lion or tiger an african lion or one of the flavors of tiger i don't know who you think is more ferocious what are the parameters to consider here maybe i can throw a few out and may maybe you can give me some thoughts about how much of these parameters matter so first of all intelligence i do believe the gorilla is the most intelligent i've did research for this as you can imagine the the or with joe rogan the the expert adviser to this very podcast and this very topic is indeed joe rogan yes so in captivity gorillas have been documented to show complex emotions form family bonds the ability to use tools and to be able to reason about the past and the future that's impressive so that that's something that at least in captivity the other animals have not been able to do they already sound much more advanced than i am yeah so that's intelligence then there is weight i think that's something that you think of it first the lion let's go with the big ones i i took notes here five hundred fifty pounds for big lion that's exceptionally large like most male lions are around four hundred and fifty pounds that's an exceptional beast then thank you the the tiger can be larger than that yeah much much larger so we got the grizzly bear which is probably the biggest of the bunch at at the large ones get to fifteen hundred pounds correct me some of these numbers believe most grizzlies around a thousand pound mark it's a big big beast i was looking up the biggest but i didn't wanna do the biggest ever just what are the big like the top of the range because there's always a range you can put it in roughly double that of even a very big lion of course how that weight is used is very important so there's also things which i find as interesting as anaconda which is let me throw that in there because there it's two hundred pounds what i really like about that is it's not just the weight it's the form factor and i think out of all of these the ancon is the most nonstandard form factor i totally agree with that yeah so that that can be used it's like the the the knight on the chessboard it comes in from a completely different angle so we got that we got also strength in which could be measured in ability to carry stuff so this was surprising to me i did look into this carefully the grizzly bear at a thousand or fifteen hundred pounds can only carry at most its body weight which is a lot but a gorilla can carry ten times its body weight a gorilla can lift over two thousand kilograms that's over four thousand pounds and and gorillas themselves an adult male weighs in around three hundred fifty to four hundred or four hundred yes yes so i like how in this particular place where i found this two two thousand kilograms is as heavy as thirty average humans so gorilla can carry thirty humans so that's carrying strength and then of course bite force because that's one of the weapons mhmm in question here so a now this is really surprising to me i the gorilla has won me over through this by the way intelligence i'm a sucker for intelligence but the gorilla bite force is the highest of all these with thirteen hundred psi bear is second with twelve hundred psi tiger is third i think tiger and lion is third with a thousand psi that's comparable and a bear is anywhere from nine hundred to a thousand psi they're close but gorilla i would not have expect now that's gorilla is not a carnivore but apparently it chews it's mostly it's grassy stuff right but it like it's difficult to explain why it has such a powerful bite and it also of course has very large incisor teeth as well as chewing teeth so also no neck yeah so its neck begins at the top of his head and just goes down to the shoulders yeah well a lot of the way they use their teeth all of these animals they the the ultimate kill is to go for the neck the bite on the neck i don't know exactly why that is probably has to do why is that because it's a very strong controlled position not just that it's a is it the same as jujitsu you think because they get to also choke them out it's very much in line with jiu jitsu like lions are famous for using strangulation as their primary method of killing they they get a hold of the neck and hold until the animal drops plus claws i believe the tiger and the bear use their claws and the lion too the lion right the and the lion this is something that the gorilla doesn't do and and it kinda obviously doesn't yeah different different so what what what do you think how do we think about this also there is i'm just not letting you talk apparently there's levels of aggression in terms of these are also very important considerations yeah what what is important to you all the considerations you've raised are are very important and we we would have to address them if we're gonna go through this topic first things first whenever you go into a discussion of this kind there's a kind of natural impression that we all have as to which one would be the most formidable and it's important that you become rather skeptical of your first intuitions because they're often very misleading just as every boy thinks his father is the strongest man in the world and then when he grows up into adulthood he realizes his father was not even close to being the strongest man in the world it's not because of anything other than inexperience to a boy his father seems overwhelmingly strong he literally can't even imagine anyone else being stronger than that so naively he thinks his father is the strongest man in the world so too in our relationship with animals when we look at a silverback gorilla it just looks overwhelmingly strong to us to a degree we just almost absorb it like you picture the greatest combat athletes that humanity has ever produced they pry mike tyson gordon ryan for grappling they would literally be torn limb from limb by an angry gorilla it wouldn't even be remotely competitive and so there's a sense in which we look at them in awe because of what they could do to us but that can be very misleading and just as a boy looks at his father as like the pinnacle of strength you can't necessarily from a position of inexperience and weakness look at a given animal and say oh that must be the toughest animal in the animal kingdom there's levels to this game and i think we can point out that the gorilla ultimately would be pretty low on those levels despite the fierce appearance pushback to this analysis because the data we don't have much data on this we don't have we actually have slightly more than you think i believe oh boy well it's anecdotal i feel like it's out of context so these species don't use this is not mma they don't do interspecies fighting often yeah but there are some ways of looking at this which can take this already interesting question and make it a lot more interesting first we've seen that intuitions aren't to be trusted so if intuitions aren't to be trusted well what is to be trusted here well i've always believed that there are three general elements that determine what level of success or failure anyone will experience in combat and this is true both for individuals and for groups and even all the way up to nations the first is what are your skills the second is what are your physical and mental attributes so it's skills attributes those are the two primary ones and there is a third which is your experience in using those skills and attributes and real world scenarios okay so whenever two we'll we'll start with two humans when two humans get into a fight ask yourself what is their skill set what are their physical and mental attributes and what is their experience in using those in real world applications and that will give you your first look at okay who's gonna be the more successful then in addition to those three general elements there's also four more specific elements what is the ability of the combatants to initiate combat because initiation is a big deal in fighting the one who sees the enemy first and can create ambush conditions or initiate compact combat in an area or terrain which is favorable to them this is huge in determining the the outcome of battles second not only is initiation important but disengagement is important a lot of battles don't go according to plan and so your ability to disengage at will and break off and away from a battle is key to success so initiation and disengagement are big the third big element what is your ability to end a fight okay do you have an efficient method of ending conflict without that the conflict could go on to a point where you no longer have the ability to to to continue it if you have some succinct method of finishing this is huge in combat in determining winner or loser so both from a winning and a losing position yes if you don't have one there's a high much higher chance you'll lose but if you have an ability to finish an opponent in the conflict reliably this is very very important in determining success or failure and third is your ability to endure a conflict longer than the person you're you're engaged in okay engaged with sorry and so you get these four more specific elements now do you have the ability to initiate contact at will do you have the ability to break contact and disengage at will do you have the ability to finish your opponent efficiently and do you have the ability to endure longer than your opponent does if you have all four of those that's huge for for combat that probably applies to human on human everything military conflict everything even all the way up to nations yeah also ask yourself what are the most efficient methods of combat across the globe across all species all times etcetera etcetera and you will see that ultimately they always come down to three things the first is concentration of force okay one of the most successful combat strategies of all time is the ability to take concentrated force against the zone of weakness in your opponent and if you can do this you will often break through to a point of vulnerability attack that vulnerability in a way where your opponent cannot respond and cannot recover from that vulnerable point being broken do a high amount of damage with precision yes so this is one of the great combat strategies in across the animal kingdom across human history etcetera the second would be ambush tactics if you can ambush an opponent with the element of surprise this is huge for success in combat they're almost all of the the truly successful predators on this planet are ambush predators the ability to get off to a good start in a way where opponents simply can't recover is huge for combat are we allowing ambush in our discussion because humans would call this cheating perhaps yes we would and well well humans are pretty damn good at it too so and then the third is endurance okay some species some people humans actually are pretty good at this use endurance as a weapon and they simply wear an opponent down over time and break them internationally this can be done economically through through numbers etcetera etcetera and and you can destroy someone with sheer endurance yeah a lot of wars throughout human history has been siege warfare yeah and so when you ask yourself okay which one of these animals are going to be the most successful in combat ask yourself well there's these three elements which tend to determine success of phaedra and warfare which animals exhibit these three principles the best and we'll discuss this but as far as generalities go whenever you ask a question who will win between a and b ask yourself in terms of the light of what we've just discussed what is their skill set what are their attributes both mental and physical what is their experience in utilizing these in real world situations and then the four more tactical elements who gets to initiate contact can you break off contact at any given time what is your endurance can you keep going longer than your opponent does so with skill set i wonder if a big component of that of how much practice there is off off the battlefield so how much quote unquote you would probably call it play like play fighting let's start going through our animals okay when you look at the gorilla you will see immediately that almost every experience a gorilla has of combat is theatrical yes they don't engage in killing things they scare rival males away in order to gain ownership of females but there is almost no intraspecies death in those conflicts they're almost entirely theatrical they have for example enormous canine teeth but there is no record of them ever being used in combat they appear to be used purely for intimidation purposes there's a sense in which they have this tremendous appearance and they have tremendous potential like they they really do have freakish levels of strength in in many different ways and yet the actual track record of using it is negligible so strange that evolution would develop such a powerful it it it is strange like their bite force just makes no sense with regard to what they actually eat i think well no i i think they even the presence of canines doesn't make a lot of sense they're not gonna use them what are they it comes down to this idea of their their big thing is intimidation so as a show you wanna fake it and don't care if you ever make it because fake it is good enough given that particular dynamic now let's contrast that with a male lion lions take on the biggest meanest toughest animals in the most competitive killing war on planet earth which is continental africa and they literally just take i mean occasionally they lose but it's rare and they take out everything just in order to eat they have to take down wildebeest cape buffalo like like cape buffalo are incredibly dangerous beasts just by themselves and yet lions regularly take them down occasionally large numbers of lions will even swarm elephant and over twelve hour periods take down elephant on some occasions this is all on video this is not just speculation so they just have a level of combat experience which no other animal can can do if i were to also project so the the eastern european style of wrestling where they spend so many hours on the mat they really value the number of hours on the mat at play from childhood the lions probably from my extensive watching videos on youtube they seem to play with each other yes for fun a lot and i guess with the gorilla cubs you see it you don't interact you don't play with other gorillas you have like you're more spending a lot more time around the opposite sex yeah so yeah i mean even lions when they they fight each other the mortality rate when lions fight each other male lions for ownership of a pride is very very high much much higher than i believe any other species on earth there almost always fights to the death for the simple reason that when a male lion loses control of the pride the first act the new lion does is to kill the genetic offspring of the previous male lion so when a lion fights another male lion when one male lion fights another it's not just a fight for his own life it's a fight for his genetic offspring and failure means not only does he die all his offspring dies and so when they fight the implications are so deep it it's it's like a fight for your not just you but your your dna most male lions have very short runs at the top to get killed or run off by by other lions now this kind of harsh combat experience no other animal can claim to have this between what they kill to eat and what they have to do to defend their their their stake and a pride no other animal fights like that they just bring a level of depth to combat which is unmatched in the animal kingdom they also have some other elements too that they get to they get the luxury because of their social nature of taking more risks than other animals like a tiger hunts alone so if it gets injured it's a big problem it can die if it's injured a lion can fight cape buffalo get injured and be covered by the other lions for food until it recovers so it learns to take risks and it's not afraid to go out and fight very very hard whereas other animals tend to shy away from risk because they're solitary bears are solitary the tigers are solitary so they learn from an early age not to take the big risk to go up to a certain level and stop if i could push back so that's that's aggression and risk taking that's a plus for the lion but to defend the gorilla because you said skill set they are of all of those the only ones that use tools have shown to use tools we didn't say anything about weapons a gorilla could in theory pick up a rock and it does have the like the force the power and the capabilities to do a lot of damage k so it doesn't have the practice mhmm it doesn't have the experience but don't you think if if a a gorilla's back is to the wall so you put them in a situation of it is life and death for both the lion and the gorilla don't you don't you value intelligence at least a little bit here there's a reason why humans this is like evidence that you know humans have spread all across the world while being kinda weak why okay intelligence is a huge huge asset humanity is positive proof that it is the most important asset but it takes time in order to work its magic it took humans two hundred thousand years to go from the bottom of the food chain to the top of the food chain and gorillas have a lot of work to do before they get to that level there was you must confess you said you said in theory gorillas could do this but let's talk about practice now first off there are many documented incidents yeah of leopards killing gorillas that's that's anecdotal evidence no it's not anecdotal bunch of bitch ass gorillas walking around we know this we're asking it's not anecdotal it was observed by a group of people who specialized in in observing gorillas over a twelve year period they regularly found gorilla toes and lipid defecation they also saw that over a certain period some thirty six gorillas have been killed and evidence strongly suggested leopard predation was the reason apparently leopards had figured out that there was a femoral artery in gorillas' legs and were doing a move which from the sounds of it sounds a lot like a barimbolo mhmm where they were spinning underneath gorillas and biting the femoral artery and then disengaging and watching them bleed out and die and then eating them now a a leopard is no match for a lion it the only defense it has to align is to run up a tree it cannot engage with a lion on anything close to equal terms it may seem like we're going on tangents but we're not just because of the foot the attack of the artery on the foot is there weaknesses that the lion might have of that what i'm saying is i i know it's not equivalent but the the fact that a leopard does so well against even fully grown male gorillas makes you should make you rather suspicious of a gorilla's ability to fight a lion fair enough let's also go further into this we have concentration of force the lion has the quintessential concentration of force which is fangs and claws the gorilla is the exact opposite it can't even make a fist and so it can only throw open handed slaps and grab things so it it has no ability with its with its arms to concentrate force in any kind of efficient way when a a lion or a tiger sorry or a bear for that matter swings at you it's got four claws from four to six inches long it's like four blades going into you they can retract their claws so they're always sharp but the reach is significantly longer for the gorilla the length of the the ability to engage with speed on the part of the the cats is is far far greater and also mobility on two feet the bipedal nature of a gorilla the the the temporary bipedal so this is the bear has the same it has no impact humans are bipedal and lions kill two hundred and forty humans a year on average so okay okay okay what about bear now bear bear is a different that's for all the same things that a lion has the claws the teeth yeah has more weight yeah has more strength has more power okay now this is an interesting question okay you get a a fully grown north american grizzly versus an african lion this is an interesting bat i also have questions about polar bears it's unclear to me because they're big they're bigger in every way than than a than a grizzly yes but they probably don't get the experience in the practice yeah also they have a much more limited set of animals that they they prey upon so pretty sure grizzly is gonna be tough to beat as far as top beer goes a grizzly bear i believe would be a a formidable adversary even for a for a male lion they're literally twice their size they have an ability to get away from strangle holes by standing up on two legs so the the lion's primary method of killing which is to strangle would be very difficult for them to employ upon a bear interestingly the bear's primary method of killing is to pin it pins animals and then just slowly eats them while they're still alive they have a rather barbaric means of killing lions are much more humane in the way they kill i what i see as the primary problem is that neither one would able be able to kill the other that finishing thing that you imagine they would both fail on the finishing criteria the lion would not be able to strangle a bear even in a best case scenario where he got his teeth into the neck the bear can stand up and and presumably shake him off the the the the the bear would never be able to pin a a line for long enough to be able to hold it down and and and slowly maul it over time the way it came with an elk or a caribou so i don't believe either would be able to finish the other they would just become exhausted it would be it would come down to endurance now that's where things get interesting because the bear is much more of an endurance hunter and the lion is much more of an ambush hunter lions quick explosive much higher top speed they got a top speed of forty five to fifty miles an hour a bear can do up to thirty five but it can run for long periods at up to twenty five miles an hour very long periods they're mostly an endurance hunter they just run elk and moose down until they're exhausted and then pin them and kill them so if it came down to endurance might go the way of the bear if they were if they were caged up together however there is very strong evidence from both hunters and video which shows on many occasions bears being chased off by cougar and wolverines now what's that that's fear what is that what do you mean chased off if they fight over meat which and say for example a cougar has killed something and the bear wants the meat the cougar will the bear has chase off the risk aversion exactly exactly the bear is a risk averse what i would say is this the bears are very very powerful in their domain but they don't have the battle experience of a lion they don't take on animals as tough as a cape buffalo they don't take on elephant what the toughest thing it would probably take on would probably be a a bull moose and a bull moose is a formidable animal but it's nothing like a cape buffalo it's nothing like an elephant an elephant or a hippopotamus so what i would suggest is this in the wild i don't believe either one is capable of killing the other but i do believe based on video evidence of cougars and wolverines chasing off bears that a lion would provide enough threat in a brief fight that a bear would back away if you put them in a cage however where neither one could back away i would slightly favor the bear based on the fact that it neither one can kill each other would come down to endurance you mean like an octagon yeah that's gotta be the next ufc by the way bear versus the but things change joe rogan is a big fan of the idea of fighting in a stadium for humans fighting in a stadium so in the stadium a bear i would i would slightly favor a bear now i still think that the lion would have a chance but i would favor the bear in a betting match some of the best evidence we have for animal versus animal fights come from the ancient romans who actually used to put animals in gladiatorial combat and they for example had several incidents where they wrote about tiger versus lion conflict and in one famous passage they described a lion getting destroyed by a a female tiger mhmm so there's there's some evidence to suggest that they had more expertise of this than we do because they they had a big population of wild animals which they just put to fight each other unfortunately there's nothing that they wrote about bears versus lion they did talk about bears versus bulls they did talk about lions versus tigers but they never mentioned bear versus lion so we don't have any evidence for that so so we had to be a little bit more speculative now given that bears do get chased off by cougar and cougar is weak compared with a male lion what lesson do you draw from that by the way i would suggest that is it about the bear is it about the cougar yeah it's more about the bear like in theory a bear should be able to crush a cougar but it seems to be the bear is just saying this thing could hurt me so i'm not gonna risk injury and backs away i think it would back away in the wild from a lion but put him in a cage and i slightly favor the the grizzly based on endurance so the final conclusion if you had to just bet everything you own so you got let's say we got the octagon we bring in a bear now this is like legendary bear okay full grown grizzly full grown grizzly but not only that that grizzly has seen some shit what what what's the most it could have seen a bull moose a caribou that's the toughest opponents he's ever had it once no no no no this one once ran into a pack of other grizzlies and had to fend and he's got scars pack of grizzlies isn't it a pack of grizzlies it's solitary wolves wolves wolves wolves good practice for a bear who attacks a bear that's that's my point bears don't really live in a competitive environment lions do sometimes it can get desperate as it was a pack of wolves but that pack of wolves is it's nothing alright fine lions deal with packs of hyenas okay what was the just imagine over the past hundred years what do you think is the hardest fight that a grizzly bear has been in like somewhere in alaska we never heard all of a sudden in the middle of the night all you hear is the bear just yeah they don't really there's there's nothing that does there's gotta been something humans have killed they they run millions of people before cougars and wolverines like they've just no that's anecdotal evidence there's gotta be one bear there's video footage of it you can watch it yourself anecdotal evidence there's got i guarantee you in the dark of the night there was an epic battle of which there's still legend amongst the bears in that part of canada who did it battle in canada moose the bears you don't think they'd go at it yeah bears fight each other but it's largely theatrical they never kill each other when lions fight each other they kill each other all the time like that's someone would have seen it by now interesting alright so so you're so you're already saying bears it just they they they they wanna get their feet wet they they you're giving no credit for gorillas so you're saying lion wins your money's on the line no i'm saying lion would win in the wild because they they can't kill each other they can't end the fight that's one of our most important criteria but lions can almost always initiate the action because they have much better ability to see at night for example bears have very average night vision lions have superb night vision so at nighttime they can always initiate the fight lions are natural ambush predators so it's always gonna be out of have the advantage of of ambush the great advantage that bears have is endurance but bears are very risk averse and they're not used to fighting like the toughest toughest animals the the toughest animal they fight is a a moose or a caribou these are not not even close to the animals that that lions have to go up against on a regular basis so if somebody wins it's gonna be the lion for you i still think that the size and endurance of the bear if they were locked in a cage together i would still favor the bear under those circumstances but in the wild i believe the bear will back away quickly cage no time limit you favor the bear what if it's five rounds or five minutes championship rounds then i would go with the lion because the lion has a huge speed advantage so it's gonna it's gonna injure it tear it up and and do immediate damage like i'll put it this way if a lion and bear fight first fifteen minutes i favor the lion a hundred percent but then as time goes by that size and weight is gonna and endurance is gonna have an effect i i'll bring up shortly somebody that's gonna probably disagree with you about some things hopefully it's a grizzly bear and he comes in and just eats me oh that would be so epic make a hell of a podcast yeah i wonder who we would eat first who would look scarier or more delicious i'm not sure the black and white could either piss them off he would think you were a penguin is that a good thing or not not good if it was a polar bear maybe it's different do you care penguins in the north pole deeply about your about athletes you coached about people in your life so i have to ask this question if one of those athletes let's say gordon ryan now i was the dictator of the world and this would entertain me so i force you and gordon to do this to fight a bear or a lion gordon has to how would you coach him to do it to have any chance of winning he goes in empty handed empty handed you can choose stadium or cage gordon ryan empty handed versus a lion you get to choose lion versus bear it's up to you okay my advice would be very simple yeah i would say gordon you're fucked you're going to die badly choose the lion because it will strangle you to death rather than pin you down and maul you to death didn't we just talk about audacious goals when when they call me a guy this is not a question of audacious goal this is a question of minimizing pain so you coach your athletes to to quit before the battle has been fought a hundred percent yeah what is he chance nothing has a chance how what's he gonna do you you don't think there's a technique first of all intelligence so technically what's he gonna do a heel hook no no well first of all maybe he can't do a double he's got four fucking legs okay what if gordon gets any starting position he wants oh yeah that that's gonna be really useful and if he can't have back control on a thousand pound beer yeah what good is that control off shaken off he'll get torn off with what like the with reaches backwards he's got four six inch forward oh okay i wonder what is the reach what if he touches he's got what if it's not a way flexible bear so you think they there's no control what about like a low like a some kind of controlling position from yeah like you said marple like from underneath we we're the the nothing this discussion is so insane that i didn't even know where to begin criticism i don't think you're open minded enough we could we could turn this down forget about gordon fighting a a a lion or a bear that's that's completely impossible an adult male chimp will destroy gordon so not even a gorilla what about the aggression yeah the the the aggression a male chimp is more than enough to kill any human on the planet including gordon ryan so gordon ryan fighting a chimp a good sized no a thousand times how many times does he win he loses a thousand times it's not even competitive it's not even remotely competitive do you think he will disagree no okay do you think anyone will disagree anyone yeah moron okay somebody that i i think you might know is a famous actor tom hardy but he's also doing quite a bit of jiu jitsu the reason this makes sense to bring up now is he's also i saw narrating a new sky original series called predators coming out in december where they follow five different predators and tell their full story about all the fighting and the killing and all that kind of stuff and he's doing the he's like gonna it's like what the morgan's it's like morgan freeman from marshall and the penguins it's tom hardy for for the predators so i don't i saw a bear and a lion in the it's in the trailer but they also had something i i didn't watch it too careful but they had something like a hyena so they think they were talking about i don't know if it's a hyena but something like that like pack animals yeah that attack and hyenas are formidable formidable animals so it's not all about size it's about like strategy and all that the the most important thing in nature is numbers like you know a pack of animals will always destroy a single animal and i think that show in particular is not a hundred percent about who wins or so on it's about the fascinating stories of how these predators sort of dominate their particular environment because it's it it's not about these like artificial matchups it's about giving your environment how to succeed and all that kind of stuff maybe we could do gordon ryan versus a house cat he gordon might have a a small chance against the house cat maybe maybe see now i know you're just trolling me i i think gordon has a chance against well definitely against the smaller apes but i have no way of proving it and and the internet will say i'm an idiot so there you go if you can't do that it's correct so there's a oh it's funny enough i'm looking at tom's instagram he has a picture with hanzo he's competed recently which is very cool in jiu jitsu that's awesome that's tough to do for a celebrity to step in absolutely yeah i understand he he used to consult with me a little bit on moves when he was starting out he's a very very nice person oh about jiu jitsu yeah talk to him he asked questions about jiu jitsu he struck me as being a very very nice person i would love to be a fly in that wall but he he made a post on instagram which i'd love to get your opinion on he has very much like a john donner hart style of digging into the philosophy of the impact of jiu jitsu on one's life is his instagram post eighteen pages long yes oh he's got potential then yes it's with a profound deep picture of somebody practicing the i think i think he's at least a trainee in this art of the donahue style of communication if miyamoto musashi would be alive today he would probably be doing these five page instagram posts like you do addiction writes tom hardy addiction is difficult and complex stuff to navigate as is mental health subjects which are both deeply personal for me and extremely close to my heart it is an honor to be able to represent the charity and my team reorg and the great work they do supporting the mental health and well-being of veterans of service military and first responders through the therapeutic benefits of jiu jitsu and fitness training he represented them in this competition that he competed in simple training for me as a hobby and a private love has been fundamentally key to further develop a deeper sense of inner resilience calm and well-being i can't stress the importance it has had and the impact of my life and my fellow teammates and he goes on to talk about this organization reorg that uses brazilian jiu jitsu to form a therapy to overcome physical and mental challenges strengthen social connections and improve overall health and well-being this is for veterans for people going through ptsd they have saved lives around the world by not only providing an effective and positive means for navigating and managing the challenging psychological aspects of military and first responder careers but also has allowed many to find a renewed sense of purpose identity and community that's often lost when transitioning to civilian life do you have thoughts about that sort of the effects of jiu jitsu on on on folks who've gone through some really difficult yeah yeah things in their life first of all i think this is a a beautiful statement by by mister hardy that's i must give him a a phone call after this and talk to him that was beautiful to read one thing that's always struck me when i train people who either have a military background or on more than a few occasions we have special forces soldiers come in and train with us for a week or two and when you talk to them the overwhelming sentiment i get when the conversation's over and we go our separate ways is i'm always asking myself the transition from military life especially the more extreme military lives of special force special forces soldiers back to civilian life it it must be the craziest experience of all you've got people who are fighting and dying alongside their their comrades in the most extreme circumstances that any human being can go through and then they're pulled back into a life where people are arguing with them over parking spots just like the average person's day to day life is so mundane that imagine what must be going through a man's head who a few weeks or months ago was literally fighting for his life and his comrades' lives watching people that he loved die or get mutilated in front of him things that you know in in a matter of seconds people's lives can be torn apart and and changed forever and then suddenly you get thrown into a life where people are arguing over you know who's who's cut who off who in line to to buy a coffee the intensity of camaraderie and love that you have for each other and and then war you you go from incredible intensity and war to just mundane boring life and going from one to the other where people are yelling at you or nagging you over issues that just seem so inconsequential compared to what you've been through and you're supposed to take these people seriously and listen to them but not only that you do have trauma visions of dead brothers and sisters yeah and you feel like you can't really talk to these civilians about it they what there's nothing in their experience that would enable you to have a conversation with them like they they don't even how do you talk to your new girlfriend about you know watching one of your friend's legs get taken off like there's no conversation you could have with them so i find that typically they do best when they hang out with each other because they have shared experience and they can talk about these things but i do find that most jiu jitsu schools have something like a kind of military barracks demeanor to them of like camaraderie hard work shared hard work teamwork building towards a goal over time the acquisition of skills usually along with that a kind of for want of a better word a rustic and primitive sense of humor and and a kind of soldierly way of talking to each other and disparaging you know self deprecating sense of humor and it's something that most people with military service kind of naturally come into because it's part of what they were in and so it's like a toned down version of it which enables them to form a stepping stone between the the military life that they were in all the way down to civilian life and jiu jitsu was kind of like a a bridge between those two and also the honesty so you said like the skill acquisition the honesty of really testing that skill there is a deep honesty to war in in this in a distant way but in a way there's an honesty to jiu jitsu too yeah of technique working and not and there's a final there is simulated death it's not real death it's simulated death on the mat yeah and there's a similar kind of honesty there and there's also a similar kind of esteem towards skill yeah just as regular soldiers look up to special forces soldiers because they see them as people who have you know greater skill than themselves something to aspire to so too in in in jiu jitsu like the thing that we esteem most on the jiu jitsu matters skill no one gives a a damn what you look like or what you think that you you you're judged mostly by your skill level and and so they they tend to identify with that i do think that most people from a military background kind of find a natural gravitation towards the the atmosphere of due to the learning and if it proves to be a a positive way for them to to rehabilitate and come back into civilian life then that's a wonderful wonderful thing i know we're linked with we defy which is a an organization which caters to former soldiers who were badly injured in in combat and many of whom lost limbs and or suffered mental trauma and they come in and and train and they often speak very very highly of the degree to which jiu jitsu has helped them come back into civilian life and and for them it's even worse because they come back not only mentally but physically disadvantaged after war and and i've always been proud to be associated with we defy and i'm very happy to see tom working with this organization is this an organization based in england for english veterans or is it international that's a good question i'd have to look into it it it certainly is based in england but it could be international but it's just nice to see somebody yeah use that large platform for that kind of message yeah and also to step on the on the mat and show the kind of jujitsu you would probably be proud of when he's chasing submissions he got he got an arm lock he got a straight foot lock we're not gonna analyze the techniques because you know there could be a doesn't matter different perspectives it's the intent that counts finishes the finish yeah no that's impressive he's actually quite an athlete he's he's in great shape and strong and flexible and i'm glad he's doing well with his students and it's good to see hensel's smiling face next to him i can only imagine the conversations i have to ask you a deep and important question you often when we text back and forth send me two hugging emojis can we psychoanalyze the reason why that's your favorite emoji of the hugging face let me is that it's it's like it's kinda like sending a heart but like a little bit more yeah it's gender neutral when when jiu jitsu players meet each other they often shake hands and then give a quick hug so i thought it was the most appropriate emoji for jiu jitsu players i see so so you a pretty simple explanation nothing too fraudy in there are you sure quite sure okay have you really asked yourself deeply because you really lean on that emoji is there something behind it tomorrow i'm never gonna use that emoji again walk away at four i'll i'll shock you tomorrow and and hit you with three three there's almost always two i think maybe you're a creature of habit in communication there's a there's a i'm a creature of habit in almost every aspect of my life so even emojis yeah you fall into these little pockets of how you communicate how you show affection towards others i sent i i say love a lot i sent i sent hearts and don't give a fuck if it's too like you know like in a in a you know me sending a message to like a ceo i'm about to interview i'll send a heart i don't give a damn they'll probably just like look what is this but i think people are are too afraid of simple communication of affection mhmm like it could be in any form but there's a has a hesitance to that because i think underneath it in order to show affection you're taking a risk and you're showing vulnerability because if you show affection and the other person rejects that affection you've now placed yourself in a hierarchy going back to lions of like oh this person you're just like the silly weak person and they're the strong person i think that's how you might see it i guess but i i don't to me the display of vulnerability is a display of strength not not weakness at least in human society at least at this time i don't know let me ask you about love you know i must ask john donna about love what what do you think is the role of love in the human condition at the highest philosophical level when you first ask what's like romantic love romantic love let's say romantic love i have one or two areas of apparent expertise in my life romantic love definitely not one of them so like lions versus bears i'm good animal combat i'm good pretty good at and then different grappling arts judo sambo jujitsu wrestling for mma so fighting and so on remains love you don't see them as similar it's a kind of fight it's a kind of dance by the way do you do you i'm i'm i'm there's a there's a sense in which i'm kind of glad i'm not an expert on that imagine what it would be to be an expert on romantic love you would take the one thing in life that's actually interesting and make it boring because you've once you develop an expertise about something you can start to predict how things are gonna unfold you get answers before events even occur you see you can read into the future of everything i think there are certain parts of human life where you want to be a beginner at all times and you don't wanna gain expertise so excellence and systematizing something in order to achieve excellence might destroy the very magic of things and i think that the the the magic of romantic love is the fact that we're all beginners at it and the minute you try to gain expertise in it what does that even mean like what would it mean to and would it be good i don't think it would i think you you're better off just having fun with it and plowing through and making dumb mistakes and looking like a fool and and then whatever success whatever that means comes in a kind of lighthearted frivolous kind of way and and that i think is over the course of a lifetime far more desirable than having you know expertise and and affairs of of love so i don't i don't think it's even a good thing to study too much and i think if you did you would actually take something good out of your life yeah there's there's communities of people called pickup artists that try to optimize this particular aspect which is of dating of of guys picking up girls and turning that into a system and seeing what's the most successful i think that would be i mean maybe the first few months would be good and then after that i think it would be a disaster yeah i mean given that humans are fairly easy to study from a from the standpoint of psychology i'm sure it's not that difficult to gain expertise in things like picking people up the same way advertisers can pick up your attention to sell a product you can do the same thing presumably with romance and sex but i don't know i feel like if if you became very good at it you would end up being very disappointed by the results and so as i said i think there's there's some things in life where it's better to be a beginner and this is one of those yeah enjoy the chaos the push and pull of being a beginner and make that a lifelong journey that's really inspiring to hear you say that and there's a deep truth to that that also justifies the fact that i saw karen i think it also justifies and it was sold very well that john donner should write a book on dating and that would be chapter one embrace being a beginner chapter two will be bear versus lion pivot quickly to violence by the way we totally skipped over anaconda i i assumed the implied i'll i'll i'll i'll put it to you this way on video you can watch puma yeah and and similar sized cats jaguar destroy anacondas oh no even in water which is the anacondas' preferred domain so given that puma and and jaguar are several orders below lion you have to go with the idea that lion would utterly decimate anaconda so it's probably good that we did skip over it and i think going back to the original thought that you had about this don't trust your first instinct well so think about the other elements an anagon has no ability to disengage from the fight once the fight's on it's gotta yeah go until the end it has no ability to disengage and get away its only hope would be ambush and it's got a tiny tiny chance against yeah a a truly formidable animal and the fact that if we look at actual concrete real world results when when puma and jaguar are kicking your ass you know lion and bear it's going to be a lot worse science is not to be found on youtube or rather youtube is not science i bet you there's a bear somewhere in canada that has seen some shit i'm just gonna leave it at that you're a fan of knives there's guys like miyamoto musashi who instead of doing who's number one type of tournaments when both competitors walk away only one competitor walks away miyamoto isashi is is known for somebody having john donner her like philosophical skills but also is known for having fought sixty one duels to the death and won them correct obviously what do you think made him so good i don't feel qualified to talk about him because i haven't made an in-depth study of his life and times and we also don't know how much truth there is to his recollections and there's a lot of controversy over this so i don't feel like you can give a like a definitive statement of and certainly i can't give a definitive statement of of of his prowess but his writings are fascinating and deeply insightful but as to like what actually happened out there in his duels it's unclear but there is you know with guys like that you almost certainly know that they were people like the character he projects that have existed yes whether it's sixty one whether it's twenty but people really put their life on the line in a different time in human history is there something compelling to you about fighting to the death i think it's not just compelling to me but to anyone i mean there's nothing we value more than our than our lives and to be able to say i'm i'm prepared to die for a sense of honor things that are so foreign to our modern society imagine you know we we criticize people for something as simple as like road rage and yet you can imagine someone who has a sufficiently developed sense of honor you know if you took them out of the seventeenth century and put them in a modern car they they might be killing people on the side of the road on a regular basis just over smallest acts of honor to say that your your your sense of self overwhelms your sense of self preservation it's it's a very unusual thing in the modern age and yet it appears to have been quite common back then you often wear a fanny pack i'm not gonna ask you what's inside the fanny pack but if you were to design a perfect killing machine that also wore a fanny pack what would you put in that fanny pack would it be something mundane and practical or would it be something surprising and hilarious would it be something of philosophical significance or maybe sentimental significance or it would be empty as a troll on human civilization but if it was a perfect killing machine it would have to be some kind of weapon but in a fanny pack is it anyway it has to be a very compact weapon we mentioned offline that there's also things in the chess world where there is different kind of vibrating devices that could be used to communicate information in communication with ai systems that can help you in your particular pursuit i don't think in jujitsu you need it's possible for a machine to give you information that gives you advantage you can in chess and in poker so you could put one of those vibrating devices in your fanny pack but jiu jitsu would not help you any idea what kind of weapon to fit in a fanny pack so you're a fan of knives where's the interest in knives come from by the way that's more metaphorical the truth is that in the modern world a knife is not an efficient weapon easily be overwhelmed by firearms my fascination with with knives comes more in the sense that they they convey a spirit to my students where a knife is made of steel and steel begins as oar in the ground it's an ugly unfinished product which through the enactment of knowledge time and discipline can be transformed into beautiful shining steel it can have something which it it begins as something which has no real function and becomes one of the most functional and important tools in all of human history without which human civilization could never have even begun it's what separated humans and took us from the bottom of the food chain and began our gradual rise towards the top of the food chain so it has immense historical and cultural value but it has this metaphorical value insofar as the martial artist begins as a white belt like iron ore but over time transforms into some beautiful shining steel which can have immense value in addition there's a sense of of maintenance as remarkable as steel is it is in need of constant maintenance it will fall apart through rust and neglect will destroy a blade both in terms of rust and then the edge falling apart and so just as the martial artist it's not good enough just to to learn the techniques you need to maintain them over time and just as steel is perishable so too are the skills of martial arts and that when i give a gift of a knife to a student these metaphorical elements start to emerge they say okay i began as iron ore and i wanna become the finished blade there's another sense in which a knife is morally neutral a knife can be used to save a life it can be used to cook a meal but it can also be used for murder for the worst possible purposes jiu jitsu is the same way jiu jitsu can make you a better person it can make you a worse person jiu jitsu is just a power it's not a particularly great power but it is a power and like all power it can be used for both good and bad it's morally neutral in itself and it's up to us to make sure that just as the knife gets used for good purposes rather than bad so to that jujitsu be used for good purposes rather than bad there's also an element where the basis of the knife is steel and historically there's always been a riddle of steel which is steel has the property of both hardness and suppleness the harder you make steel the better its edge retention becomes the longer that edge will stay sharp this is good but it comes at a price the harder you make steel the more brittle it becomes and now that edge can be damaged easily so the solution is to make the steel softer more malleable that will prevent breakage of the blade and chipping of the edge but when you make the steel softer that comes at a price and that price is now the edge loses its its its sharpness very easily and so the riddle of steel is how to work with these two to the greatest degree possible and create an edge which is hard enough to stay sharp for long periods of time but without making the steel so brittle that the blade overall is compromised so too in jiu jitsu your task in training is to make the training competitive enough that you actually get used to the rigors of of real combat but on the other hand it can't be so brutal that the athletes get broken down in the gym to a point where they're no longer effective and so this duality of hardness and softness which we see in the case of blades is there in the training of the jujitsu athlete so i often give a gift of a knife to a student when they've done something significant because it demonstrates in a metaphorical way these key themes of the sport well i've been honored to be a student of yours i've been plagued by injury but i hope to one day earn one such knife and i think that's a really powerful metaphor i'm really honored that you would spend any time with me in any context but especially on the mat and especially today in conversation john you're an incredible person thank you for everything you do congratulations for historic accomplishment it's always beautiful and inspiring to see greatness and what what i saw what we saw at adcc was greatness rare greatness and it's beautiful to see that humans can achieve that kind of thing so thank you for for making that happen and thank you for talking today thank you lex thanks for listening to this conversation with john donner to support the spot guest please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from miyamoto musashi the only reason a warrior is alive is to fight and the only reason a warrior fights is to win thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
