please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's harvey silverglade you cofounded the foundation for individual rights and expression also known as fire a legendary organization that fights for the freedom of speech for all americans in our courtrooms on our campuses and in our culture so let's start with a big question what is freedom of speech first of all the organization when i cofounded it in nineteen ninety nine was called the foundation for individual rights in education it focused on free speech issues on college campuses in academia and only earlier this year did we decide to expand our reach beyond the campuses which is why the name or the acronym fire remains it's now the foundation for individual rights and expression the e used to be education the e used to be education it's now expression and we basically do a lot of the cases the aclu used to do the aclu now more is the they're a progressive organization rather than a civil liberties organization and and we've taken the the the role of dealing with free speech in in the society generally and and now this is a particularly an era prone to censorship everybody thinks they're right and that people who disagree with them should not be able to voice their views it's a very difficult period right now both on campus and off campus it's about as as intolerant an era as i can remember i'm i'm gonna be eighty one may tenth i was born on mother's day nineteen forty two and i can't remember it being this bad i was born during the mccarthy era so that says a lot and it sort of reminds me of that well let's start with that almost a philosophical question a legal question a human question what is this freedom that you care so much about that you fought for so much freedom of speech it is the most important right that americans have it's not a coincidence or an accident that it's named in the first amendment to the constitution without it no democratic society can be democratic for long and i'm an absolutist that is i believe that for example people say to me but what about hate speech well hate speech is much more important than love speech and the reason is i'm much more interested in knowing whom i should not turn my back on than i am interested in figuring out who loves me or who likes me so hate speech is the most important in my view and yet it's it's banned in for example schools it's unbelievable kids are not schooled into understanding the glory of the first amendment when when schools say to them they shouldn't say things that are gonna make somebody feel bad the purpose of speech is to express honest views that people have and so i believe hate speech is as important as love speech and my view is more important so it should be brought to the surface rather than operate in the shadows absolutely absolutely what is the connection between freedom of speech and freedom of thought well in a free society thoughts start in the brain and then they come out the mouth so they're different ends of the same spectrum so to you the censorship of speech eventually leads to a censorship of thought of course censorship of the mode by which other people know what you're thinking so there's some aspect of our society that is that thinking is done collectively and without being able to speak to each other we cannot do this kind of collective thinking and out of speed the theory is that ultimately out of speech comes truth that isn't necessarily so but i do think that when there's free speech better decisions are made because people put their views on the table in a frank accurate way and then those views mix together and clash and out of that usually comes the better the better decision not always but usually more more often than not but if somebody is not allowed to be you know sit at the table of decision making then the decision making process is poorer less robust less diverse and ultimately less successful can you elaborate on the idea of free speech absolutism so hate speech can be quite painful to quite a large number of people does this worry you yep living in a free society requires that you expose yourself to some discomfort you call it pain it's maybe emotional pain it's not physical pain but it's it's the price we pay for living in a free society every so often we're insulted we're emotionally hurt think of the alternative all the alternatives are worse nobody ever promised us a rose garden we're lucky to be in a country that has a first amendment it's also the own it's the most diverse country in the world because of immigration i mean my my grandparents my father's side came over from russia on my mother's side came over from poland i'm very happy that my grandparents came in from russia i would not want to be in russia today i'd probably be sharing a cell with a wall street journal reporter so i'm i'm thankful that they came in and this is a great country it's got troubles right now but our country doesn't and we've had before we had a civil war we had segregation we had the decimation of the indians we're not perfect but it's the best place in the world for somebody who values liberty so you don't think that hate speech can empower large groups that eventually lead to physical action to physical harm to others no i don't i think that that we have developed a culture in which it's understood that if you don't like what you hear you you talk back mhmm you write you write something we don't punch each other we insult each other is insulting great well i don't know it's okay i used to as a kid in brooklyn where i was born i was born and raised in bensonhurst we used to say sticks and stones can break by bones but names can never harm me mhmm and it's absolutely true it's what was true when i was five is true when i'm i'm almost eighty one so i've lived a long time i've seen it all and i'm talking from experience as well as theory it's what happens when you reach your eighties i read that you had this line that you cannot be protected from being called an asshole correct okay especially if you're an asshole well that's but you don't have to be an asshole to be called an asshole that's correct and i think the internet has taught me that well the internet has posed a a particular challenge to free speech absolutists because of some of the stuff that's on there is god awful but i have no different rule for freedom of speech on the internet than i have in newspapers or in lectures or in classrooms or or conversations among people what do you think about the tension between freedom of speech and freedom of reach as is kind of sometimes termed so the internet really challenges that aspect it allows speech to become viral and spread very quickly to a very large number of people well you know we've had we've had revolutions in in in the modalities of communication after all newspapers were the first challenge radio and television posed a new challenge the fcc tried but ultimately gave up the attempt to control obscenity for example and the supreme court has been pretty close the one thing that liberal and conservative supreme courts right now we're in a conservative era due to trump nominations during much much of my life we were the warren court it was william o douglas so brennan it was a liberal court one thing they agree on is free speech they don't agree on much else but they do agree on free speech and i think the reason is that they recognize that well my group is in the ascendance today but it may not be tomorrow and i wanna have objective clear rules so that when i'm in the minority i'm able to to voice my opinion and so it's one of the few things that both sides of the political spectrum agree on the only people who don't are the the people way over on the right that i call the fascists and the people way over on the left who are the communists but with respect to most people in this on the political spectrum republicans democrats socialists libertarians they agree on the primacy of free speech because it protects them when when protection is needed so to you even on the internet free speech absolutism should rule yes nobody's gonna die remember death threats are not law are not protected nobody's gonna die so people are gonna be a little bit insulted that's the price you pay for living in a free society and it's a small price in my view people some people don't have as tough a hide as others well then develop it i hope i don't want i don't mean to sound cruel but you know you're living in a free society you develop a tough hide so that's the cost of living in a free society yep there are there is a cost the thing is it it can really hurt at scale to be cyberbullied to be attacked for the ideas you express or maybe ideas you didn't express but that somebody decided to lie about you and use that to to attack you well first of all there are there were so there were some exceptions to the first amendment libel and slander is an exception direct threats or an exception you know if you if you say such and such i will murder you that is not lawful if you say to somebody if if you say about somebody oh you know you beat your wife that that is not lawful if in fact the person knows you don't beat your wife there are some limits defamation is one direct threats are another so it's not this is not the first amendment is not absolute but this is it's more absolute than it is in any other society and it's pretty near absolute for for example fraud if you will sell somebody a a car and you say oh this is in great running shape and in fact it's an old jalopy and it's not gonna make it more than ten miles that's fraud that's not free speech so free speech is not absolute there are these limits but they're very narrow specific categories of limits but there's gray area here because while legally you're not allowed to defame a person in the court of public opinion especially with the aid of anonymity on the internet rumors can spread at scale thousands hundreds of thousands of people can make up things about you you have to defend yourself using more speech we're we're big we're through freedom of speech and we're big boys and girls you have to defend yourself you know in in in some societies if you say something if you right now if you say something nasty about putin you'll end up in the gulag if you say something nasty about biden you end up in the new york times where would you rather be well let's talk about the thing you've done for over twenty years which is fight for the freedom of speech on college campuses so why is freedom of speech important on college campuses well it's important everywhere in the society but it's most important on college campuses why because that's where we educate our young citizens and if you are educated under a notion that some dean can can call you on the carpet because you say something which is considered racist or you can say something which is considered you know dangerous to to social cohesion then it's not a liberal arts college no the the theory that i used in in the shadow university a book you've written the shadow university nineteen ninety eight nineteen ninety eight you were ahead of a lot of these things by the way i'm afraid that as as a pessimist i always saw the bad side of things betrayal of liberty on america's campus is the shadow university the a book you coauthored with alan charles yes with with one of my princeton classmates alan charles coors who's now an emeritus professor of enlightenment history at the university of pennsylvania i only taught for one semester and i can go into that later you know the reason that i did not continue to teach in colleges it it was har harvard law school i i taught a course in that mid nineteen eighties but in any event the college campuses are one of the most important of of fora for free speech this is where people get education and if you don't really get a good education if certain points of view are not allowed to be expressed because education comes from the clash of ideas and you then have to decide this is the this is how you become a thinking adult you have to decide which ideas make more sense to you which ones you're gonna follow the college experience is transformative and if there is censorship on campuses it's highly destructive of the educational enterprise and ultimately to the entire society you know we have in the sciences we have a scientific method scientific method is you try experiments and you see which ones work and then you develop theories based upon the results of experiments well this is not much different from every other aspect of life you have to entertain different views on different subjects you hear all the views and you make a decision as to which one's accurate and which one's not so the scientific method i apply to to non science to history to journalism to all of these things so that scientific method includes ideas hateful ideas also correct if you don't allow hateful ideas i mean when when scientists do experiments nobody says to them oh you know don't don't do that experiment because it would be very bad if that turns out to be accurate you know that outcome that's not the way it works every every point of view is thrown into the marketplace whether it's science or whether it's you know nonscience and that includes the kind of ideas and the kind of discourse that might actually lead to an increase in hate on on campuses the the the first amendment prohibits speech which is liable to produce imminent imminent violence yeah so for example you know the the exception is yelling falsely falsely yelling fire in a crowded movie theater a lot of people misstate it they say oh the exception is yelling fire in a movie theater well if there's really a fire you're forming a real important function for the fire part but it's falsely yelling fire yeah you start a riot people would be crushed try to get out so there are these that that's one of the exceptions of the first amendment as the supreme court has defined it there are very few exceptions and defamation is an exception i'm a i'm not a fan of that exception frankly but if you say something about somebody that has serious implications in their in their life in their ability to earn a living if you say accuse somebody of being a pedophile but it's not true that person can sue you my own view is i think that's an unfortunate exception but i'm not on the supreme court i think that i'm i'm with a friend of mine was nat hentoff nat hentoff who wrote for decades for the village voice in new york he was a friend of mine he was a free speech absolutist and he wrote a fabulous book called free speech for me but not for thee and he was an absolutist and i'm i'm with i'm with matt hentoff even on the defamation aspect i mean i agree with you in some sense just practically speaking it seems like that the way the best way in the the public sphere to defend against defamation is with more speech correct and through authenticity through authentic communication of the truth as you see it yeah you know at times the boston globe has said something about me that hasn't been accurate they have invariably published my letter to the editor mhmm i'm also not bashful about getting in chart in touch with the reporter they at the end of every column they give the reporter's email address and i know people say that i i have more access to the media than most people but all that means is i get the fame more than most people can we also comment on from the individual consumer of speech there's a kind of sense that freedom of speech means you're you should be forced to read all of it freedom of speech versus freedom of reach we as consumers of speech do we have the right to select what we read we do and nobody can force us to sit in a room and listen to a radio program that we don't wanna listen to nobody can force us to read a book that we don't wanna read the whole motion of freedom of speech means that people have autonomy on their choices in order to form a complete mind and complete human being there's a kind of tension of that autonomy versus consuming as many varied perspectives as possible which is underlying the ethic of free speech so on college campuses it seems like a good way to develop the mind is to get as many perspectives as possible even if you don't really want to well that's that is the theory academic freedom is the is supposed to be the highest degree of free speech yeah you should be able to entertain all kinds of hateful threatening ideas and and the the way i put it is there's something wrong when you can say something with complete abandon without any fear in harvard square whereas on the other side of the fence you can't say it in harvard yard it should be the opposite and what happens is universities from the best to the worst from the most famous to the least well known have been taken over by administrators administrators do not really subsume academic values they know nothing about the constitution they know nothing about free speech they know nothing about academic freedom they feel that their job is to keep order and so they develop speech codes kangaroo courts to enforce the speech codes and these are very dire developments i wrote about them in the shadow university in ninety eight and tried to deal with them in nineteen ninety nine when i started fyre coastarted fyre and i would fire the reason i'm running currently for the harvard board of overseas is what i'd like to do is convince the harvard corporation the so called president and fellows of harvard college the chief governing board of the university with the real power the board of overseers is a secondary body but quite influential to fire ninety five percent of the administrators it would have a salutary effect on the academics of the university it would have a salutary effect on free speech and academic freedom it would cut tuitions by about forty percent and it would create a whole different atmosphere on the campus and the same could be said of mit or any other place i think administrators are a a a a very bad influence on american higher education can you sort of elaborate the intuition why this thing that you call administrative bloat is such a bad thing for university well first of all just in terms of the the the cost of yeah maintaining there are more administrators in america without education than there are faculty members yeah the cost is enormous number two they are inimical to the the the teaching enterprise and and they feel that their job is to control things to make sure there are no problems that nobody's feelings are hurt being called you know be before a a dean because you said something that insulted somebody is something that shouldn't happen in american higher education yet it happens because you have these administrators who think it's their job to protect people from being insulted you you insult a a black student you insult a woman there's a disciplinary hearing well there shouldn't be black people are accustomed to being insulted jews are accustomed accustomed to being insulted women are accustomed to being insulted and it's very good to know who doesn't like you it's useful it is very u it's essential information to know who doesn't like you if everybody is forced to say i love you and nobody can say i hate you you get a false view of what life is all about outside of the university outside of the university i mean you do graduate eventually and that's ultimately the mission of the university is to prepare you to make you into a great human being into a great leader that can take on the problems of the world correct and you don't do it by by treating you like a like a little flower but what role does the university have to protect students to women african americans anybody jews anybody who gets can get could be a victim of hate speech they they they protect you from physical assault if somebody physically assaults you then they they they get punished but they shouldn't insult they shouldn't protect you against insult because that is a violation of academic freedom the freedom of the insulter to insult you and also as i said it's very useful to know who doesn't like you it's useful for the so called victim i think it's just that i wanna know who doesn't like me it's as important to me as knowing who who likes me but do you also believe in this open space of discourse that the insulter will eventually lose i think that's true i think that the insulter eventually will wear out his or her welcome i do but i i like to know who the insultors are because it gives you a deeper understanding of human nature yeah and and and usually by the way my experience has been that the insultors have generally not been as smart as the people they've insulted yeah and that's probably one of the reasons they insult them because they're they feel inferior yeah i mean i'm not trying to be a a a a psychoanalyst here but a lot of the people who were the haters are pretty low down in the intellectual scale anyway ninety five percent of administration you would fire you're calling to fire ninety five percent of the administration people should know i think people that don't really think about the structure the way the universities work are not familiar i think with the fact that administration there's a huge bloat of administration you know when you think about what makes a great university it's about the students it's it's about the faculty it's about the people that do research if it's a research university they don't think about the bureaucracy of meetings and committees and rules and paperwork and all that and all the people that are involved with pushing that kind of paper and there's a huge cost to that but it also slows down and suppresses the the beautiful variety that makes the university great which is the teaching the student life the protest the the the the clubs all the fun that you can have at a university all the very kind of exploration which you can't really do once you graduate correct it's the place the university is a place to really explore mhmm in in every single way so let me just talk about this important thing because i'm very fortunate to have contacted you almost by accident in a very important moment in your life you're running for the harvard board of overseers what is this board how much power does it have and what would you do if elected okay first of all i have a i have a prediction yes that in about five years they're gonna probably change the name because overseers reminds people of the slavery era yes and we're in such a politically correct era now that the english language is being restricted corrupted is the way i put it because certain words are are are forbidden we we have some problems in this country and i think part of the problem is the educational system has lost a sense of what academic freedom and free speech are all about and and and i think it's essential that the educational system begin to take more seriously what free speech and negative freedom really are that's why i'm running for the harvard board of overseers so let me just link on the the role of the administration in protecting free speech so what often happens i think you've written about this is there's going to be a few maybe a small number of hypersensitive students and faculty that protest so how does harvard administration resist the influence of those hypersensitive protesters in protecting speech in protecting even hate speech harvard has done fairly well under the presidency of lawrence bacow i have had a couple of meetings with bacow i like bacow i have donated to harvard a print of my late my late wife took a picture of bob dylan and allen ginsberg when the rolling thunder revue got to harvard square and it's a it's sort of an iconic photograph she called it the music lesson because it's got dylan teaching ginsberg how to play the guitar and i donated one of those to to harvard it's hanging in backhouse's office he the new president claudine gay is not known for respecting academic freedom and free speech people have said to me well give her a chance well i'll i'm willing to give her a chance but she does have a record and she's a bureaucrat i don't think she believes in free speech and academic freedom i think she's a progressive not a liberal i'm not happy with the the the the appointment of claudine gay and it has made more essential my attempt to get on the board of overseers so let's talk about the board of overseers and your run for it the specifics actually okay it'd be it'd be nice because i think you're a write in candidate and the election is over on may sixteenth yes and i think there are specifics i'll probably give them in the intro i'll give links to people but the specifics are complicated let me just mention that you have to be harvard alumni so i've graduated from harvard you have to in order to run and in order to vote in order to vote and the process i imagine is not trivial but this is done online and if you're an alumni you should have received an email from a particular email address harvard at m g election services court dot com and presumably there's a way to get some validation number from that email and then you go online you enter that validation number and you vote and you to vote for harvey you have to enter his name correctly harvey silverglate and spell it correctly right obviously i'm imagining this because i'm mit not harvard so i'm imagining the process is not trivial there's you have to click on things you have to sort of follow instructions that are not trivial and i'll also provide an email if the process is painful it doesn't work for you that you can email email harvard and complain i t help at harvard dot i d u and so on i'll provide all the links but is there something else you can say about the voting process what you're running on this is my second run mhmm the first time i got enough signatures to get on the ballot then the harvard alumni association sent out a letter to all living harvard alums recommending that they vote for the officially nominated candidates that excluded two petition candidates of whom i was one and i wrote to the alumni association and i said you have now sent out the curriculum vitae's and the policy positions of all the officially nominated candidates there are two petition candidates on the ballot i would like to be able to send out my positions to the voters they wrote me back saying our policy is to only send out the policy positions and the platforms of officially nominated candidates can you believe that well this is a liberal arts college right from the where from the clash of ideas truth emerges well really this is what i call harvard's not so subtle means of candidate suppression not voter suppression candidate suppression and everybody can vote but not everybody can run it is it'll it'll becomes a liberal arts college where you know the clash of ideas will produce the truth what about the clash of ideas on the board of overseers the board of overseers is important it doesn't have the same power and authority as the harvard corporation the so called president and fellows of harvard college but it's very influential and very important and it would be a great perch for me to try to exert influence for the university to get back to where it was before it was taken over by the administrators well i'm pretty sure that most of harvard alumni most the students currently going to harvard most of the faculty at harvard probably stand behind the ideas and the ideals that you stand behind yep the the people that love harvard and what it stands for so yeah the alumni were educated in an era when these concepts were taken more seriously and before the administrations administrators took over so i do think if i get my message out i'm gonna win the seat and if i win a seat i will have a great perch for for for trying to convince the real power that be which is the harvard corporation to do the things that i'm suggesting you know get rid of ninety percent five percent of the administrators get rid of the speech codes reduce tuition by forty percent all of these salutary benefits can you imagine if harvard became the most affordable college in the united states well the affordability is another aspect but i think before that the just the freedom of expression freedom of speech freedom of thought yeah at america's greatest universities i think is something that everybody would agree on it it would have a it would have a a tremendous effect on the the whole country and is there something to say about the details of how difficult it is for alumni to vote do you have experience with this the the you could vote online or you can vote by paper ballot you could request a paper ballot and all i could say is that the the hard part is getting the message out my name doesn't appear on the ballot because i couldn't get enough sandwiches well harvey harvey silverglate s i l v e r g l a t e you know when my grandparents arrived from russia yeah the the the the name in russia was something like zilbeglitz yeah and the immigration officer had several choices he could have said silvergate yeah gate is a real silver and gate are real english words yeah he could have said silver glade g l a d e those are real english words that's how my name is often dispelled either silver gate or silver glade mhmm silverglade is a nonsense syllable and why the immigration officer chose to transliterate silva zilbaglid as silverglade i'll never understand and it is the cause of endless mistakes in my name well the the fundamental absurdity of life yes is also the source of its beauty yes anyway we shall spell it out and we shall get yell loud and wide that everybody who has ever graduated from harvard should vote for you if they believe in the ideals of the great american universities which i think most people do let me also ask about diversity inclusion and equity programs you've been you've had a few harsh words to say about those you know the idea of diversity i think is a beautiful idea you said that harvard's idea of diversity is for everyone to look different and think alike correct can you elaborate and and be comfortable and be comfortable yeah first of all it is impossible if liberal law is education taken seriously it's impossible for students to feel comfortable why because one of the roles of college is to challenge all the beliefs that they grew up with which mostly are the beliefs inculcated by parents and by elementary school teachers and the idea is to be able to challenge those thoughts those ideas and if you don't have free speech and academic freedom those views get reified they do not get challenged so it's it is it it it violates the fundamental role of higher educational institutions to have any restrictions at all that's number one number two as i think i said earlier if people students are not allowed to be frank with one another they don't really learn about one another and you know i i've given a lot of lectures in which i have said and and i think peep students now understand it i'm much more interested in hearing from the people who hate me than the people who love me i'm much more interested in knowing who disagrees with me than people who agree with me that's how i learn and that's how they learn the clash of ideas which is the theory behind the first amendment that truth will somehow emerge or if not truth at least a better truth a truer truth a more useful truth if ideas are allowed to clash especially in the structure of a university where at least i would say there's some set of rules some set of civility i think i would rather read mein kampf to understand people that hate there is also quality to disagreement that we should strive for and i think a university is a place where when disagreement and even hate is allowed it's done in a high effort way you know somebody asked me once about what books i would what i have is required reading in in literature courses and i listed mine comp and they were horrified and i said well it's one of the most important books of the twentieth century yeah i mean six million jews died an enormous number of other people died because one guy wrote a book called mein kampf and took it seriously it's one of the most important books ever written how can how can an educated person not have at least breezed through mein kampf and it's not a great read though it's not a great read he was not a great writer but you you you do get a sense for the the sociopath that was adolf hitler yes because he really acted on the words that he wrote yeah and it was there and if people took that work seriously correct they they would have understood it's one of the most important books of the twentieth century and it's politically incorrect to read it it's crazy but can you speak to the the efforts to increase diversity in universities which i think is embodied in this die effort of diversity inclusion and equity programs where do they go right where did it do they go wrong okay let me tell you first of all this may surprise a lot of people i am opposed to affirmative action and i think that what it does is it labels people by their race by their religion and by their national origin precisely what we don't want people to do is be pigeonholed in those categories the reason that affirmative action has become the way that universities decide on who gets admitted is because historically people in what's called marginalized groups blacks gays hispanics have been discriminated against in the admissions process now what i have suggested is that instead of affirmative action and by the way here's a prediction the supreme court is going to abolish affirmative action is the case pending is it a harvard case it's there's a there are two cases joined together one of a public university and one of a private university the private university is harvard i i predict that the supreme court will vote six to three to abolish affirmative action it is on its face it is a violation of equal protection of the law some groups are favored because of race or ethnicity it is a classic violation of equal protection clause when affirmative action was approved the deciding vote was just cassandra day o'connor she wrote a very famous opinion in which she said i am hesitate to vote to up to keep up dear to affirm the notion of affirmative action because it's such an obvious violation of equal protection but we have an urgent problem in this society we are not educating our members of racial ethnic minorities and we have to try to get them into our colleges so i'm i think it should be approved for twenty five years and it will it should be it it should in twenty five years it should have performed this role well it hasn't and the twenty five years is coming up i think it's three or four years left the supreme court is going to abolish it you can take my word for that because it is such an obvious violation of equal protection why do why did affirmative action come into play because the secondary and elementary schools are so bad public secondary and elementary schools are so bad why are they so bad partly because of the control that the teachers union has randy weingarten runs the public school system in the united states and what i have suggested is that the effort should be to this is an emergency it's a national emergency to improve the quality of elementary and secondary education and one way to do it is to hire teachers who are fabulous teachers rather than necessarily members of the union mhmm i have come to oppose public workers' unions i am a very strong supporter of unions in the private sector why do i think there's such a difference between unions in the public sector and the private sector in the private sector management is arguing bargaining with its own money and with the money of shareholders in the public sector there's only one side there is the teachers' union and then there's a school committee that is dealing with the taxpayers' money not their room and so it's a very skewed power balance so as supportive as i am of private sector unions i am an opposition of public sector unions they're very destructive and i think without the teachers union teachers who are really skilled will be able to get jobs they would not have to worry about the seniority of teachers who long since have given up really creative teaching and we have to improve the public educational system i had in in my late wife and i had a classmate of we have a son who's now forty four who went to the public schools in cambridge he has a friend first name eugene who was a black kid from roxbury whose mother understood that the schools in roxbury were terrible the schools in cambridge were pretty good he lived in our house monday to friday and he went to school with isaac in the cambridge public schools mhmm elsewhere and i would show up to school committee meetings when there was bargaining between the teachers union oh and the school committee the teachers union objected to our being there we argued with taxpayers we have a a kid in the school and we have his his best friend lives with us and goes to school with him we have a real interest and the school committee walked out of the bargaining session the city council then reconsidered its vote and they voted that we that citizens taxpayers parents of kids in the school could not show up to these negotiation sessions i thought that was absolutely outrageous but i understood why because these contracts are crazy no sane municipality should enter into some of these contracts and so i am a i have become an opponent of the national teachers association the cambridge teaching a lot cambridge teachers association i don't think there should be unions for public employees because there's no real bargaining going on and i would think that the public school system will never be improved as long as the the the teachers are unionized so that to you is at the core of the problem that results in the kind of inequality of opportunity that affirmative action is designed to solve so if you if the educational system in the elementary and high school levels is improved we wouldn't need affirmative action these kids would get good educations so from all backgrounds poor kids in the united states will get good education correct if public unions are abolished correct and but do you more and incidentally the postal service would probably work better too that's a whole another conversation yeah but do you at the core of the problem of the inequality in universities that diversity inclusion and equity programs are trying to solve is the public education system correct of secondary education yes correct elementary and secondary elementary and secondary education well then is there use what is the benefit what is the drawback of die diversity inclusion and equity programs at universities at harvard it's an affirmative action basically yeah and what it does is it allows the system of elementary and secondary education to be bad because they could say oh we got our kids into harvard yes but you haven't educated them and it it covers up the wound and i think it will never improve as long as we're able to cover up the wound and as i said affirmative action is gonna be abolished by the supreme court it's a clear violation of equal protection which is what santrish day o'connor understood but ignored intentionally but as an experiment and i believe it's gonna be abolished and that's gonna have that's gonna force the elementary and high schools to get serious do you see the same issues that you discussed now at harvard at mit we're here in boston so i have to talk about the the great universities here in boston you've written about mit i'm the university i love i'm a research scientist there do you see the same kind of issues there yes i do do you remember can you explain the case of dorian abbott lecture that was canceled at mit yeah well it's you know it's this this is not the only it's not the only incident there have been incidents all around the country of of academics professors who have used the don't comport with the as the great lillian hellman another friend of my late wife said they they they she said she refused to cut her garments in order to fit the fashions of the day dorian abbot didn't cut his suit to fit the fashions of the day he didn't his intellectual suit and so he was this has happened at princeton this has happened at harvard this has happened at mit the great universities in the country have decided that the clash of ideas is not such a good idea because some people's hurt feelings will be hurt well this is there was quite a revolt against it fire sounded the alarm and then in the end the universities were i believe abbott was invited to come back i think he turned him down his he he shouldn't have turned him down but he did and when when the light is cast upon these situations the universities back down because they're so embarrassed yeah and the newspapers because newspapers depend on the first amendment in order to exist newspapers tend to give pretty good publicity to these cases of censorship so they grow the universities yes so they they really emphasize they catalyze the embarrassment yes so is that one of the ways is that the best way to fight all of this yes sunshine is the best disinfectant you've written about mit's connection to jeffrey epstein yes he was well connected at mit and at harvard what do you what lessons do you draw about human nature about universities about all of this from from this saga let me say this i believe that universities if somebody was to for example donate to a university and donates on the requirement that the building be named after them if the university is taking donations and the person is funding a building the unit and wants the building named after them the building should be named after him humber or them mhmm harvard is facing this now with the sackler building mhmm because sackler the sacklers had become now a persona non grata because of their role in producing the opioids that caused huge scandalous opioid addiction there are people who want to have removed the name sackler from the sackler art museum at harvard larry bacow the president of harvard to his credit has refused to to do that and if it reminds people that the money was earned through selling opioids that's good that's good that people understand that that's where the sacklers got their money they should be bonded in my in in in in my undergraduate alma mater at princeton there's a movement to remove the name woodrow wilson because wilson was president the united states how he got to be governor of new jersey was he was so insufferable that the trustees of princeton got him the nomination to run for governor of new jersey they had said we gotta get this guy out of here and not because he was anti black and anti semitic because the trustees were as well but because he just was insufferable he drove the faculty crazy and they got him out and so princeton was thinking of changing the name i wrote a letter to president eisgruber at princeton saying you know the the this is part of the university's history you don't wanna re you wanna rewrite history falsely woodrow wilson was the president of this institution he was one of your predecessors he never answered me either i think these people you know they they know they have no answer the reason i didn't get a response from president eisgruber is the same as the reason i didn't get a response from the headmaster of milton academy they understand that what they're doing is violative of the fundamental precepts of academic institutions yeah they're ashamed they that they feel they have no choice because they feel that they would be criticized for racism homophobia blah blah blah blah blah blah criticized by how many people well they feel that they would be criticized by students and parents and donors i disagree with that i actually think there are more people out there that agree with me than agree with them yeah by a large margin by a large margin in what i call the real world which is the world outside the campus but academics are afraid they'd be criticized they're incredibly thin skinned when i say academics i mean academic administrators they're very thin skinned politically correct holier than thou as i said i would fire ninety ninety five percent of them and i would be more careful in who i elected to this in this institution so i said pauline gay is probably gonna be a disaster at harvard so it takes guts it takes courage to be in the administration when the task of protecting the freedom of speech is there and also which in part requires you to admit and to uphold the mistakes you have done in the past correct not to hide them correct and that to you to you i mean jeffrey epstein for harvard and for mit is a very recent mistake well there's a debate whether it's a mistake they took money from him yes okay is it a mistake to take money from bad people do you have to do a morals test of a potential donor i don't think so it's complicated because if there are no conditions attached to it i think it's emotionally complicated i don't think that it is rationally complicated it's emotionally complicated it's particularly complicated if they want naming rights yes you know the jeff jeffrey epstein biological laboratory that that would be a problem for most universities i don't think that naming rights have to be given to somebody that you that you don't think is worthy of having their name i think think the university has the right to say no we'll we'll take your money but we will not name the building after you i think they have a right to do that there's some degree in which you whitewash the name though if you not not not with naming rights but if you take the money if you take the money it allows the person in public discourse to say that they're collaborating they're working together with harvard and with mit well i have a problem with universities making morals tests of sure of donors because not every donor is as bad as epstein but some of the donors made their money in industry by being rapacious by paying low wages by exploiting people you can make the case that accepting money from the department of defense from darpa from the united states organizations that contributed to waging war and killing hundreds of thousands of civilians over the past few decades correct folks like the tenured professor noam chomsky will make the case that that is far more evil than accepting money from jeffrey epstein yes still jeffrey epstein is a known pedophile yes so that's why i say i would i would not give him naming rights i think the university has the autonomy to not give naming rights but i think that giving a morals test to donors is a is a pandora's box what do you think about the aftermath of the jeffrey epstein saga it feels like i'm not familiar with harvard's response but mit's response seemed to fire a few scapegoats and it didn't seem like a genuine response to the evils that human beings are capable of sort of like rising to the surface the description in a fully transparent way of all the interactions that happen with jeffrey epstein and what that means yeah what what that means about the the role of money in universities what that means about just human beings in power money money is essential to run a university yeah one of the reasons it's essential is because the university is artificially artificially requires huge amounts of money and that's partly because of the administrative army that they that they they support and they would be less dependent on the jeffrey eppscheons of the world if they didn't have the the so it's sort of all part of the same circle but but there's a tension here you're saying we shouldn't be putting a morals test on money but actually if you make if you expand the amount of money needed to run the university this you're going to make less and less more and more unethical decisions correct because of accepting and this is again i i i am flexible enough to say that i don't think i would name a building after somebody who is truly evil i think university has the has the right to limit the naming rights on a for a donor if i was an absolutist i would not even say that but i'm i'm not an absolutist i i have my limits and that's one of them the the the jeffrey epstein biological laboratory it's a little bit much it feels like there should be a requirement on there should be more requirements on who to accept money from but the question is that the the concern you have is about who gets to decide and what's the alternative correct i think there is no alternative i think that turning down donation because you you you don't approve of the conduct of the donor is a pandora's box but i'm just sickened by the fact that an evil human being was allowed to walk in the halls of a university i love so what do we do with that well are you telling me that now of the students are evil are you telling me none of the faculty members are evil you telling me some none of the administrators are evil but that doesn't sure sure so saying scapegoating saying that jeffrey epstein is evil can help us forget can aid us in forgetting that there is other evil in the world and some of it might be roaming still the halls of mit and harvard hey listen i won't tell you the name but i represented somebody in the mit administration a few years ago who is who is charged with sexual improprieties against students and as a lawyer i represented that person people say to me how could you represent some of the people i represent are bad people see how can you represent them i said well if i was a cardiologist and this person had a heart attack on the street and i didn't deliver cpr i would be have my license taken away i'm a lawyer the only difference between my obligation and the doctor's obligation is the constitution gives people the right to assistance of counsel they don't have this constitution says nothing about the assistance of cardiologists i have a very high duty to represent on popular people well i think as i apply the same test to the college donors the university should not have a morals test whose money to take i i i do draw a line about naming rights of buildings and as i say that's an inconsistency with my absolutism but i just emotionally i just can't deal with having you know as i said the jeffrey epstein biological laboratory well for me emotionally there's nothing that sickens me more in the university than the abuse of power right and there's an awful lot of people who abuse power at the university and especially when it comes to abuse power over students correct so so sexual harassment so in the realm of sexual abuse of power and all kinds of other no it's just a crime to use one's power position in order to take sexual advantage of a student it's a crime yeah this is not a close question yeah but it there's a legal crime and there's a deeply ethical crime and there's an emotional response that i have you are a good lawyer and perhaps a good man to want to defend some folks who are evil in this world i don't think i have that emotional fortitude well then you shouldn't be a criminal defense lawyer or a cardiologist i think you're right i'm still deeply sickened by jeffrey epstein and the faculty the administration that still might be in these great american universities that are abusing their power in small ways and big ways but that's human nature you get a little bit of power and you're in bad man or a bad woman and you take advantage of it yep we see that in the smallest of ways and in the biggest of ways in institutions and regimes all across the world boy harvey it's a complicated situation well it's a complicated world and it's complicated to be a human being and this is nothing new and we should talk about it without restriction alright just to linger on liberal arts in two thousand fourteen and probably still today you wrote that liberals are killing the liberal arts yes so can you explain yes the problem with i'm a political liberal mhmm the problem with the the the political left is that it has divided between what's called progressives and liberals liberals are people of the left who believe in the first amendment absolute first amendment and in due process of law and the the problem with with progressives now in the pursuit of equality what they view as equality they're willing to bend those rules and this movement actually started in brandeis the the critical it's the critical race theory it started herbert marcuse was a professor at brandeis and he came up with his theory the theory was this this is right out of orwell in order to create true equality in a society where you have some downtrodden and some who are the ubermenschen in order to create real equality you have to reduce the rights of the upper classes and artificially increase the rights of the lower classes and that will produce a out of out of unequal treatment true equality will be will be attained this is nonsense the idea of discrimination producing true equality is nonsense my view is as i've said earlier in our discussion that the way to increase the opportunities for the lower classes is to give them real educations and until we do that it's not gonna happen and in order to do that we have to overcome the problem of the teachers' unions at the elementary and secondary school levels until we're willing to do that honestly and improve those schools we're gonna have a problem of large number of uneducated people who need a boost because we haven't given them proper educations what do you think about some of the more controversial faculty in the world so an example of somebody i've spoken with many times on mic and offline is jordan peterson i'm not sure if you're familiar with his work yes but he is an outspoken critic of or proponent of free speech on campus and he's been attacked quite a bit he's a controversial figure which the role of the university to protect the jordan petersons of the world i think a university has an absolute absolute not relative not worded absolute road obligation to protect academic freedom of even the most controversial faculty members and you can imagine on a university campus you have more people who are outliers than you do in the general population and that's the hope at least hopefully yeah and and and those outliers have to be protected they can't be pressured they can't be fired they can't be disabled from spewing their their views whether they're considered racist whether they're considered to be you know promote an idea of human society that's considered obnoxious it it doesn't matter if you can't if if you can't have freedom of thought on the college campuses where can you you know then we're lost as a society we're lost and as an educational institution educational institutions no longer educate they will indoctrinate that we have to avoid at all costs and we should also remember that the outlier might also be the only bearer of truth so in nazi germany speaking against the fascism fascist regime and communist soviet union speaking against communism they might hold the key to the solving the the elements of that society absolutely some of the most important discoveries in science for example were were mocked at the beginning i mean think of poor charlie darwin charlie i see he is on nickname levels with you well because we're talking about these big topics of sexism racism and hate we should not forget about the smaller topics which might even have the much bigger impact which is what you're speaking to which is outlier ideas in science so basically welcoming controversial ideas in science and by controversial i mean just stuff that that most of the community doesn't agree on it doesn't actually harm anyone at all but even then there's always pressure one of the things i'm really concerned about is how little power young faculty have that there's a kind of hierarchy seniority that's that universities have empowered by the administration where the young faculty that come in they're kind of pre pre tenure pre yeah there there's a there's a process in chasing tenure where you're kinda supposed to behave and there's an incentive to kinda fit in and to not be an outcast and that that's a really huge problem because oftentimes the youth is when the craziest the biggest ideas the revolution ideas come and if you're forced to behave and fit in and not speak out then even in the realm of science the the innovation is stifled well now you now you trigger my having to tell you this story that you're triggered this is good in the mid nineteen eighties i decided to take a four month sabbatical from my law practice yes professor james vorenberg who was at the time dean of the harvard law school heard about it heard about it from his wife elizabeth betty vorenberg whom i was very friendly with because we were both on the aclu the aclu of massachusetts board at the time and so betty told jim that harvey was taking a sabbatical jim called harvey and asked harvey if he would like to teach a course at the harvard law school because there was nobody who had teaching criminal law from the perspective of somebody who actually was in court litigated it was all theoretical i said sure i'll do it so i taught a semester at harvard law school the student evaluations were fabulous why because it was really interesting they were hearing a lawyer who was talking about real cases i actually brought in a few of my clients to some of the classes and so jim called me and said hori the students love this course i'd like to offer you a tenure track position at the law school you'd have to give up your law practice i turned him down he said did you just say no i said yes i said no he said how come he says nobody ever has ever in my administration has ever turned down a tenure track offer at harvard law school i said because i could see that i'm not a good fit that the administrators are overrun the place that faculty members especially untenured who are afraid to say things that might not get help them in the tenure quest it's it's not a good fit for me i'm just saw this in the mid nineteen eighties already yes nineteen eighty five and i went back to my law practice i i did not wanna get into this me crying that that i saw actually i i started to see it before the turn of the century because i coauthored the shadow university in ninety eight and then cofounded fire in ninety nine i'm i'm an early student of this phenomenon what are some other aspects of this the book the shadow university that we may have not covered well let me let me tell you a story i believe i tell it in the shadow universe because it was part of i'm loving these stories harvey the stories are fabulous let let me tell you a story of i i i i did a tour of the country go visiting campuses mhmm i visited a college called hamline university i believe it was in indiana or illinois somewhere in the midwest and i i attended a freshman orientation mhmm now listen to this this was a freshman orientation the administrators the deans and the d nets and the deputy assistant deans and d nets and the third deputy assistant deans and d nets lined the students up according to their skin hues oh boy the the blonde blue eyed white folks were at one end the darkest you know african americans who had whose bloodlines had not yet mixed with any of the whites on the one on the other end and the exercise was you had to tell how your race affected your success in life up until that point i thought it was the most demeaning thing that one could imagine demeaning i thought to myself they could do the same about sexual orientation they could do the same about religion they could do the same about national origin it would be demeaning no matter what yeah and and the students actually verbalized how their race had either been a plus or a minus they did they did and i thought it was so demeaning it just confirmed all of my distaste for this kind of this kind of approach let me ask you from the interviewer seat so i get to do this podcast and i often have to think about giving a large platform and having a conversation with very controversial figures and the the level of controversy has been slowly increasing what's the role of this medium to to you this medium of speech between two people and me speaking with a controversial figure me or some other interviewer what's the role of giving platform to controversial figures say members of the kkk or dictators people who are seen as evil well we wanna face the world with reality and the reality is that there is some unpleasantness unpleasantnesses in the world you know running from genocide right through to ordinary discrimination to offensiveness it's the real world as we we know it exists are we afraid to say it do we wanna make people think that we live in a world where those words are not used where those animosities don't exist the answer is no but you can whitewash you can normalize the use of those words and you can whitewash the acceptability of certain leaders so for example interviewing hitler in nineteen thirty eight nineteen thirty five nineteen thirty six nineteen thirty seven thirty eight those are all different dynamics there but you can normalize this person and in so doing create enormous harm well see i don't see it as normalizing i see it as exposing if more people had taken moncalf seriously franklin roosevelt would have acted much sooner he only got us into the war as congress to get us into the war when the japanese made the mistake of attacking pearl harbor but there were some people in the state department there were some people in the administration who were trying trying to get roosevelt to see what hitler was really like and he was blind to it and this was one of the greatest presidents the united states ever had he was blind to it until the japanese attacked pearl harbor so i think that words unpleasant ideas as expressed by rhodes are essential for communicating fact and truth and reality and that's why i think that we should not whitewash language we should not whitewash the fact that jeffrey epstein was pretty close to mit and harvard and harvard and you know reality reality actually means something yeah but from the role of the interviewer that's something i have to think a lot about whether interviewing hitler you said exposing i think it's hard to know what hitler's like in a room but it's also hard to know i've never met jeffrey epstein it's hard to know what jeffrey epstein is like in a room but i imagine to some degree they're charismatic figures so exposing them in the interview setting is not an easy task well interviewing is not an easy alright job yeah it's it's not a good idea to have an interview or be an idiot i know exactly what you're saying and i know why you're looking at me directly as you say it i appreciate that harvey alright let me ask about your your friend your colleague alan dershowitz and i'll also ask about your review of his most recent book but before then it'd be interesting to ask what you think of him as a human being as as a lawyer he's a quite an interesting case he's represented some of the most controversial figures in history including jeffrey epstein including jeffrey epstein mike tyson julian assange jim baker and jeffrey epstein and even donald trump so he's an interesting figure what do you think about that that's about bulow what do you think what do you think about him as a human being as a lawyer what he represents in terms of values and ideals well he's a criminal defense lawyer and the the job of a criminal defense lawyer is to represent accused criminals he he he is a lifelong democrat he didn't represent trump because he agrees with him politically voted for hillary i believe you wrote he voted for hillary yes that's what he says and i absolutely believe it he's a he's a liberal democrat but he's a criminal defense lawyer as well as a professor and i've represented some very nasty people in in my career i i wouldn't go out for coffee with them but they have constitutional rights to representation and you take that very seriously yes you notice something that people don't understand about dershowitz he was asked by trump to represent him in the second impeachment as well he turned him down why do you think he turned down so people should know he represented trump in the first impeachment he represented only in the first and he was successful and when trump was impeached the second time he asked allen to represent him alan has had a lifelong policy of only representing somebody once never twice why because he never wanted to be house counsel to the mafia and so he early on had this position he only represented somebody once the mafia wants a lawyer who's an in house counsel who represents them in all their cases so that's the reason and allan never publicly explained it i know it's a fact because i've known it from the day that we met at harvard law school nineteen sixty four he was a first year professor i was a first year student we both had burglar accidents and we hit it off we've we've been close friends ever since so there's some kind of unethical line that's crossed when you continuously represent a a client yeah he thought it was not so much an ethical line you have a right to represent mafia people but he didn't wanna be house counsel he didn't wanna be you know have them ask them for advice in advance of what they were doing yeah he he was willing to represent somebody he wants no matter how awful klaus von bulow was accused of killing his wife these are pretty nasty people but he didn't want to be house counsel to any of them so you wrote a review of alan dershowitz's new book yes on donald trump the title of that book is get trump the threat to civil liberties due process and our constitutional rule of law can you summarize this book and your review of it yes by the way i coauthored it with my research assistant who's sitting right here emily yes and i thought that the book was another example of the fact that everybody is entitled to a defense and that alan's being involved with trump was purely professional it was not political it was not philosophical and i thought that the fact that he was being criticized he was being shunned because of his connection to detroit i found it very interesting that this is a guy who represented such i call them distasteful figures as klaus von bulow as mike tyson as oj simpson as sheldon siegel when he was considered to be a skillful lawyer made his reputation and then he represents donald trump who to my knowledge never killed anybody and he's suddenly shunned i thought the hypocrisy of it the political preening was very distasteful to me and it was not only because he was my friend if he wasn't my friend i think i'd have the same view the holier than thou nonsense the hypocrisy of it you know they wouldn't talk to martha's vine now alan and i are different i'm not so sensitive i'm someone doesn't wanna talk to me no problem no problem at all but alan is considering how controversial his life has been he's somewhat sensitive he's somewhat sensitive and i'm just telling al you know al don't let it get to you you know i i can relate i can i can definitely relate taking on some controversial conversations still wearing my heart on my sleeve it hurts all of it hurts yep but maybe the pain makes you a better student of human nature yep maybe that's the case for him nevertheless the book has a makes a a complicated and i think an interesting point he opens the pair he opens the book with now that donald trump has announced his candidacy for reelection as president the unremitting efforts by his political opponents to quote get him to stop him from running at any cost will only increase these efforts may pose the most significant threat to civil liberty since mccarthyism so is he right he's absolutely right because these attempted pros the for example the the one prosecution that has been brought now alvin bragg in in the manhattan i have looked at that and i don't believe that trump has committed a crime and yet bragg was pressured to bring that people in his office were threatening to quit if he didn't indict wholly improper wholly unethical and he's gonna lose the case has trump committed crimes yes most of it are tax crimes if his he has cheated on taxes his whole career as far as i could tell he could easily be indicted for state and federal taxes but those they're not as sexy and i think that he's become a target by ambitious politicians ambitious prosecutors he has gotten some sympathy which he doesn't deserve and a lot of it is is pardon the phrase political correctness the better people are not supposed to be trumpers mhmm i i had an interesting experience about trump i had two interesting experiences the more recent one was i was in the house of lawrence summers the former president of harvard who was driven out by political correctness by the way he insulted women biologists i was in his house when he was still president of harvard when the trump hillary clinton contest took place and i was with elsa we were invited to sabra's house in brookline and it looked like hillary was gonna win and the harvard faculty members they were all celebrating they were all figuring out what their cabinet positions were gonna be blah blah blah blah blah and then about eleven thirty at night all of a sudden it was announced that in terms of electoral votes trump had just eked out of victory that hillary beat him in the popular vote but he had won the electoral college and there was immediate depression and that was meaning like quiet over the room the room became absolutely stone silent and they they were all you know disappointed well that was a memorable moment and it it told me that they were a little bit too overconfident they they were savoring being part of a presidential administration ambition had been thwarted i'm not a great fan of preening ambition i think it blinds people to realities and the resulting arrogance from such ambition and the arrogance yes it's one of the reasons i didn't accept jim vorenberg's offer to be part of the academic community i mean i represent professors i have friends who are professors i represent students i have friends who are students and i have great regard for universities and higher education but i was not about to become part of the culture i thought that it was not good for me and not good for the institution either that can a culture that can breed arrogance yes self importance yep and in a sense the election of donald trump was a big f u to such correct such a why i think he why i think he he managed to to pull it off to jump topics a little bit what what do you think about something you've written about what do you think about the mass surveillance programs by the nsa and also probably by other organizations cia fbi and others and broadly what do you think about the importance of privacy for the american citizen okay i believe that the fbi should be abolished because i believe that its culture was so corrupted by its first director john edgar hoover j edgar hoover that it is impossible to reform the fbi to make its agents honest to force them to obey the constitution the the first fourth and fifth amendments especially and it's a culture that cannot be changed hoover established the culture and no fbi director since has been able to change it if you go online i did on youtube a video for the aclu of massachusetts it was when i was on the board it was probably when i was president of the board i was president of the board for two years i was on the board for twenty years and i did a a video about advising people to never ever ever talk to an fbi agent when they come knocking on your door can you briefly explain the intuition yes they have not to talk to an fbi agent have a system when they come in to interview you two agents show up never one one asks the question the other one takes notes the the note taking agent takes notes and it goes back to the office and types up a report called a form three zero two which is the official record of what was asked and answered so when i have a client interviewed by the fbi i show up and i always agree almost always agree to the interview mhmm but i bring a tape recorder and i say alright i'm gonna tape this and they say well we're by regulation we're not allowed to do the interview if it's taped the the record is the three zero two the agent is taking notes i say well i have a policy too my policy is to never allow a client to be interviewed unless it's recorded so it's unfortunate but we're gonna have to end this meeting and the agents get up and leave and the i have never seen a form three zero two that i consider to be accurate the agents write down what they wish you had said yeah rather than what you said it is a wholly corrupt organization that has not gotten any better since hoover died and fundamentally the the corruption is in the culture that is resisting the the the constitution of the united states correct the first and fourth and fifth amendment correct it's not it's not financial corruption it is it is corruption of the mission and i think it should be abolished and if we need a federal investigative agency it should be a new name a new culture wholly new members a new director and it's it's it's impossible to to reform the fbi can you elaborate on what exactly is broken about the fbi is it the the the famous saying from stalin's k g kgb head bury show me the man and i'll show you the crime right is it that kind of process of it's it's that kind of process they decide who's guilty and then they go about concocting a case against the person who who who who they wanna get so the goal is not to find the truth or it's to solve the solve the case and close it and incense the reputations but to show that an innocent man is guilty is also solving the case from their perspective so to falsely convict or falsely imprison an innocent man is also solving the case well it closes the case if they falsely imprison an innocent man they're interested in closing cases so that's the fbi but broadly speaking about the surveillance aspect of this what are your views on the the the right that an american citizen has to privacy well wiretapping and electronic surveillance are very very intrusive and i think that the circumstance that these tools are used should be narrowed for example they're used in a lot of drug cases since i don't think drugs should be illegal in any event i certainly think that it's a terrible violation of privacy to to to use why it's happening in a drug case i could see it in cases of murder possibly in cases of serious extortion but on other kinds of kinds of crimes where they wiretapped especially drug cases because i believe drugs should all be legalized anyway i think it's the the the the price we pay as a society is not worth it there's on the wikipedia page for nothing to hide you're cited in fact your book that you gave me today three felonies a day is cited so nothing to hide argument that's an argument that if you're a well behaved citizen you have nothing to hide and therefore your privacy can be violated well the problem is that under the federal criminal code particularly the federal criminal code mhmm it is very easy to be charged with a crime now why under the constitution the federal government does not have plenary criminal jurisdiction that's up to the states how is it that the feds indict in so many areas of american life it's because the supreme court has allowed the following absolutely insane situation to prevail anything can be made a federal crime if in the course of the commission of the crime the means of interstate communication or travel are used that means that if you commit a crime which is ordinarily would be a state crime and you use the telephone or you send a letter it suddenly becomes federal mhmm that means that the limitation that the founding fathers who wrote the constitution intended to keep the feds out of daily life and to give that jurisdiction to the states has been completely thwarted because i can't think of the a case where somebody doesn't use a telephone in the course of planning discussing something that's arguably criminal and so this limited authority the federal government to bring charges in criminal cases is illusory feds can indict a ham sandwich so basically everybody's guilty and if if if if the if the feds wanna bring you in they can they can find a way and that allows them to terrorize people who are dissidents yeah what is broken what works about the american criminal justice system from your perspective from all the jury the jury system the jury system yes you like the jury system everyday citizens representing twelve ordinary people have to agree unanimously in order to convict what do you think about the highest court in the in the land the supreme court what works and what is broken about the supreme court as an institution what are its strengths and weaknesses well the supreme court is is is unfortunately fairly political and the current supreme court is overruling precedents which are it's really improper imprecedents cannot should not be overruled so easily it's about to overrule the affirmative action now i'm opposed to affirmative action i think i made that clear earlier in our discussion but still it's a precedent and it should be given some respect but in order to in order to in order to propagate a more conservative agenda the court is treating precedent as if it doesn't have any any role and that's a huge mistake some of the congressmen on the democratic side are looking to enlarge the court in order to basically do what franklin roosevelt was not able to do and and that is change the court's philosophy but i think that's very shortsighted because this is a long repug this is a long game this is a republic we have here and anyone who tries to for example enlarge the court from nine to twelve in order to get more liberals on the court then some other administration will try to enlarge it from twelve to fifteen to get more liberals on the court you'd have a constant fiddling with a very important institution so the law should have more lasting power than the the bickering the political bickering of the day correct let me ask you you've lived one heck of a a life and fought a lot of battles and you continue to do so with the harvard board of overseers so first of all thank you for that but we're all human we're all mortal do you ponder your death do you ponder your mortality are you afraid of it well let me say this my father died at forty eight he died because he smoked he died at forty eight because he smoked four packs of camels a day he got a massive heart attack at forty three he continued to smoke despite the that he died at forty eight so i did not expect to live this long because i thought it was genetic it turns out it was cigarettes so here i am i'm going to be eighty one on may tenth i was born on may tenth nineteen forty two which is mother's day coincidentally and i realized i'm not gonna live forever i also take pride in the fact that i have demonstrated that a lawyer does not have to go with a law firm in order to manage to make it you can make your own write your own what's the word write your own ticket i've done that i agree that i've had a an elite education i went to princeton and harvard law school but i don't think you have to necessarily go to elite institutions in order to really make it you need to work hard that you shouldn't put yourself in a place where you're you're not gonna feel comfortable and what's the word empowered like i refuse to take vorenberg's invitation for a taylor track position at harvard law school i'll i'll tell you one one other story that illustrates this i was originally premed freshman sophomore years at princeton i was in the premed program why because my parents wanted me to marry the daughter of our family physician and the idea was i was to go to medical school i was gonna go into medical practice with him in hackensack new jersey we had moved from brooklyn at the time long story why we had to move from brooklyn had to do with my father's having a problem with the furriers union and having his life threatened and we moved to maywood new jersey because he got a job in a fur shop in passaic new jersey and a family physician they had three daughters the oldest of whom was my age she went to hackensack high school i went to pagoda high school they're both in north bergen county and the idea was that she and i were gonna marry i was gonna become i was gonna go to medical school i was going to take become a partner of her father in his medical practice in hackensack when he retired i was gonna inherit the practice this this scenario was concocted by carolyn's mother and my mother in my sophomore year of at princeton i won a fellowship to spend that summer between my sophomore and junior year in paris i was fluent by then i had taken accelerated french course my freshman and sophomore year and i went to paris it was my first time out of the country and i spent the entire summer working supporting myself participating in airfare and i i earned money for room and board and i thought about my life and i decided number one i didn't wanna be a physician i wanted to be a lawyer number two i didn't wanna marry carolyn and i came back i changed from pre med to pre law i broke up with carolyn who is by that time at school at douglas right down the road from princeton she had followed me or i had followed her and my life suddenly took a wholly different turn so that summer in paris paris had a outsized effect of my life every year the brattle theatre shows casablanca where bogart has this great line he says we'll always have paris and i think to myself i always used to stay at elsa we used to see casablanca every valentine's day because it was such an important movie to me because paris was transformative in my life and we went to paris every year during my vacation we went to paris that was where she took some great pictures of eyes that were this high and this high they were hanging up in the house and so i always i even after elsa's death i've seen casablanca twice now she she died in twenty twenty and i'm always i always think we'll always have paris we'll always have paris well harvey like i said i hope i hope you're very successful in your in your run for the harvard board of overseers i think what you stand for in in the realm of freedom of speech is i think the thing that makes these universities great institutions in american culture and i'll do everything i can to help you succeed and i just i'm really grateful for all the work you've done and i'm grateful that you were talking to me today this is amazing thank you thanks for listening to this conversation with harvey silverglade to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you some words from harry s truman once the government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of the opposition it is only one way to go and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
