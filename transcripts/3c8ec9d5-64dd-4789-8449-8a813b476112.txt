the following is a conversation with lee cronin his third time in this podcast he is a chemist from university of glasgow who is one of the most fascinating brilliant and fun to talk to scientists i've ever had the pleasure of getting to know and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this podcast we got netsuite for

maybe you will too this show is brought to you by netsuite an all in one cloud business management system i usually do these ad rates and say whatever the heck i want but sometimes the sponsors ask politely never required but always politely to mention a few things two things they asked me to mention one is that netsuite turned twenty five years old this year congratulations happy birthday netsuite and also they want me to mention that thirty seven thousand companies have upgraded to netsuite by oracle thirty seven thousand company i wonder how many companies are out there isn't that amazing just companies are amazing a small a medium a large collection of humans get together much as we did in the caveman days around the fire but here around the office and tied together with a mission to do something to build something but do so under the immense pressures of the capitalist system like you have to succeed it's not zero sum but it is a kind of game where there's competitors and you're always at tension but also a little bit of a collaboration it's a dance and it's just a beautiful thing a dance of humans inside the company a dance of companies in the big capitalist system that are also interacting with the full human civilization society so it's a dance of humans and companies selling stuff buying stuff creating stuff it's just all beautiful anyway if you're one of those companies you should use good tools to manage all of the stuff and netsuite is one such good tool you can download netsuite's popular kpi checklist for free at net suite dot com slash lex that's net suite dot com slash lex for your own kpi checklist this episode is also brought to you by betterhelp spelled h e l p help i think whenever i mentioned betterhelp i have a lot of thoughts in my head one of them is i believe a betterhelp ad read that tim dillon has done i think it goes on if i remember correctly for a very long period of time and tim dillon's hilarious so what what what can you say but also there's a meta ironic absurd hilarious aspect to of all people tim dillon with a beautiful complexity of his mind and the beautiful complexities of his upbringing and family life the dynamics of that that he is doing an ad read for betterhelp i love it i love it i mean there's an absurdity and an irony to me doing the same but all of us need a bit of mental health assistance and betterhelp is really good for that because it's accessible affordable all that kind of stuff it's a good first step to take and sometimes all you need is the first step check them out at better

looking online store that brings your ideas to life and tools to manage day to day operations once the ideas are brought to life ideas brought to life that's a funny thing given this conversation with lee cronin ideas brought to life so we talk about the origin of life in the universe defined more generally complexity the emergence of complexity that forms life the origin of life on earth and the evolution of life as being part of the same system that integrates physics and chemistry and biology all that kind of stuff but ideas ideas as organisms brought to life it's interesting to think of ideas as organisms in the same way that all the other emergent complex organisms come to be it's interesting and shopify is a company which is a complex organism of its own that allows individual creators with an idea to bring their idea to life and manifest it into the physical world so the the imagination is a creative engine that starts from some kind of ethereal thing that just inside our mind and projects out into the physical world and creates a thing a store that can then interact with thousands millions of people it's fascinating it's really fascinating to think of ideas as living

or a full night sleep it's just heaven it's the thing that makes me look forward to coming back home when i'm traveling i should also mention that they currently ship to america canada the uk australia i need to go to australia i need to go to australia and select countries in the european union i don't know why i just mentioned that again i don't have to say anything that the sponsors asked me to say but there was this list of countries i'm looking at and continents and he just filled my mind with a kind of inspired energy to travel you know paul rosselli has been on my case to travel with him in the amazon and i wanna go i wanna go i wanna go i wanna turn off the devices and go with him he's such an incredible human such an incredible human i'm really glad he exists paul is just a beautiful human being the humor of the stories the deep deep gratitude and appreciation of nature the fearlessness but also the the ability to feel fear and embrace it and just this childlike sense of wonder i mean he's just a such an incredible human i'm glad he exists he's one of the people when i think about him just makes me happy to be alive on this earth together with folks like him

mentally or physically i'm gonna be okay when i have a nice cold bed with asleep and a delicious ag one everything's gonna be okay so you should definitely try it see if it's gonna give you the same kind of feeling it is when i don't bring the travel packs one of the things i miss when i'm traveling to have a nice cold ag one in the afternoon especially after a long run i love it life is

in the description and now dear friends here's lee cronin so your big assembly theory paper was published in nature congratulations thanks it created i think it's fair to say a lot of controversy but also a lot of interesting discussion so maybe i can try to summarize assembly theory and you tell me if i'm wrong go for it so assembly theory says that if we look at any object in the universe any object that we can quantify how complex it is by trying to find the number of steps it took to create it and also we can determine if it was built by a process akin to evolution by looking at how many copies of the object there are yep that's spot on yep spot on spot on i was not expecting that okay so let let's go through definitions so there's a central equation i'd i'd love to talk about but definition wise what is an object yeah an object so from so if i'm gonna try to be as meticulous as possible objects need to be finite and they need to be decomposable into subunits all human made artifacts are objects is a planet an object probably yes in the if you scale out so an object is finite and countable and decomposable i suppose mathematically but yeah i still i still wake up some days and go to think to myself what what is an object because it's it's it's a nontrivial question persists over time i'm quoting from the paper here an object is finite is distinguishable i'm sure that's a weird adjective distinguishable we've had so many people help offering to rewrite the paper after it came out you wouldn't believe it so funny persists over time and is breakable such that the set of constraints to construct it from elementary building blocks is quantifiable such that the set of constraints to construct it from elementary building blocks is quantifiable the history is in the objects it's kinda cool right so okay so what defines the object is its history or memory whichever is the sexier word i'm happy with both depending on the day okay so the set of steps it took to create the object so there's a sense in which every object in the universe has a history yep and that is part of the thing that is used to describe its complexity how complicated it is okay what is an assembly index so the assembly index if you're to take the object apart and be super lazy about it or minimal say what it because my you know it's like you've got a really short term memory so what you do is you lay all the parts on the path and you find the minimum number of steps you take on the path to add the parts together to yeah to to reproduce the object and that minimum number is the assembly index it's a minimum bound and it was always my intuition the minimum bound in assembly theory was really important that only worked out why a few weeks ago which is kind of funny because i was just like no this is sacrosanct i don't know why it will come to me one day and then when i was pushed by a bunch of mathematicians we we we came up with the the correct physical explanation which i can get to but it's the minimum and it's really important it's the minimum and the reason i knew the minimum was right is because we could measure it so almost before this paper came out we've we've published papers explain how you can measure the assembly index of molecules okay so that's not so trivial to figure out so when you look at an object we can say molecule we can say object more generally mhmm to figure out the minimum number of steps it takes to create that object that doesn't seem like a trivial thing to do so with molecules it is it's not trivial but it is possible because what you can do and because i'm i'm a chemist so i'm kind of like i see the lens of the world through just chemistry yeah i break the molecule apart and break bonds and if you break up if you take a molecule and you break it all apart you have a bunch of atoms and then you say okay i'm going to then form bot take the atoms and form bonds and go up the the chain of events to make the molecule and that's what made me realize take a toy example literally toy example take a lego object mhmm which is broken up of lego blocks so you could do exactly the same thing in this case the lego blocks are naturally the smallest they're the atoms in the actual composite lego architecture but then if you maybe take you know a couple of blocks and put them together in a certain way maybe they're have a they're offset in some way that offset is on the memory you can use that offset again with only a penalty of one and you can then make a square triangle and keep going and you remember those motifs on the chain so you can then leap from the the start with all the lego blocks or atoms just laid out in front of you and say right i'll take you you you connect and do the least amount of work so it's really like the the smallest steps you can take on the graph to make the object and so for molecules it came relatively intuitively and then we started to apply it to language we've even started to apply it to mathematical theorems but i'm so well out of my depth but it looks like you can take minimum set of axioms and then start to build up kind of mathematical architectures in the same way and then the shortest path to get there is something interesting that i don't yet understand so what what what's the computational complexity of figuring out the shortest path in with molecules with language with mathematical theorems it seems like once you have the fully constructed lego castle or whatever your favorite lego world is figuring out how to get there from the building basic building blocks isn't like a is that an np hard problem it's a hard problem it's a hard problem but actually if you look at it so the best way to look at it for let's take a molecule so if the molecule has thirteen bonds first of all take thirteen copies of the molecule and just cut all the bonds so take cut twelve bonds and then you just put them in order yeah and then that's how it works so and you keep looking for symmetry and or or copies so you can then shorten it as you go down and that becomes commentarily quite hard mhmm for some natural product molecules it's becomes very hard it's not impossible but we're looking at the bounds on that at the moment but as the object gets bigger mhmm it becomes really hard and but the that's the bad news but the good news is there are shortcuts and we might even be able to physically measure the complexity without computationally calculating it which is kind of insane wait wait how would you do that well well in the case of molecule let let let so if you shine light on a molecule let's take it infrared the the molecule has each of the bonds absorbs the infrared differently in what we call the fingerprint region and so it's a bit like and because it's quantized as well you have all these discrete kind of absorbances and my intuition after we realized we could cut molecules up in mass spec that was the first go at this mhmm we did it with using infrared and the infrared gave us an even better correlation assembly index and we used another technique as well in addition to infrared called nmr nuclear magnetic resonance which tells you about the number of different magnetic environments in a molecule and that also worked out so we have three techniques which each of them independently gives us the same or tending towards the same assembly index for a molecule that we can calculate mathematically okay so these are all methods of mass spectrometry mass spec you scan a molecule it gives you data in the form of a mass spectrum and you're saying that the data correlates to the assembly index yeah so how generalizable is that shortcut first of all to chemistry and second of all beyond that because that seems like a nice hack and you're extremely knowledgeable about various aspects of chemistry so you can say okay it kinda correlates but you know the whole idea behind assembly theory paper and perhaps why it's so controversial is that it reaches bigger it reaches for the bigger general theory of objects in the universe yeah i'd say so i'd agree so i've started assembly theory of emoticons with my lab believe it or not so take emojis yeah pixelate them yep and work out the assembly index of emoji yeah and then work out how many emojis you can make on the path of emojis so there's the uber emoji from which all other emoji emojis emerge yep and then you can so you can then take a photograph and by looking at the shortest path on by reproducing the pixels to make the image you want you can measure that so then you start to be able to take spatial data now there's some problems there what is then the definition of the object how many pixels how do you break it down and so we're just learning all this right now so how do you compute the how would you begin to compute the assembly index of a graphical like a set of pixels on a two g plane that form a thing so you would first of all determine the resolution so then what sure how how may what is your x y and what the number on the x and y plane and then look at the surface area and then you take all your emojis and make sure they're all looked at the same resolution yes and then we would basically then do the exactly the same thing we would do for cutting the bonds you'd cut bits out of the emoji on and look at the the you have a bag of pixels so and you would then add those pixels together to make the overall emoji wait a minute wait a minute but like first of all not every pixel's i mean this is at the core sort of machine learning and computer vision not every pixel is that important and there's like macro features there's micro features and all that kind of stuff exactly what like you know the eyes appear in a lot of them the smile appears in a lot of them so in the same way in chemistry we assume the bond is fundamental what we do in there here is we assume the resolution at the scale at which we do it is fundamental and we're just working that out and that you're right that will change right because as you take your lens out a bit you it will change dramatically but it but it's just a new way of looking at not just compression what we do right now in computer science and data one big kind of kind of misunderstanding is assembly theory is telling you about how compressed the object is that's not right it's a how much information is required on a chain of events because the nice thing is if in when you do compression in computer science well we're wandering a bit here but it's kind of worth wandering i think and you you assume you have instantaneous access to all the information in the memory yeah in assembly theory you say no you don't get access to that memory until you've done the work and then when you don't access that memory you can have access but not to the next one and this is how in assembly theory we talk about the four universes the assembly universe the assembly possible and the assembly contingent and then the assembly observed and they're all all scales in this combinatorial universe yep can you explain each one of them yep so the assembly universe is like anything goes just it's just combinatorial kind of explosion in everything so that's the biggest one that's the biggest one it's massive assembly universe assembly possible assembly contingent assembly assembly observed yeah and on the y axis is assembly steps in time yeah and you know in the x axis as as the thing expands through time more and more unique objects appear so yeah so assembly universe everything goes yep assembly possible laws of physics come in in this case in chemistry bonds mhmm in assembly so that means those are actually constraints i guess yes and they're the only constraints they're the constraints at the base so the way to look at it is you got all your atoms they're quantized you can just bang them together so then you can become a kind of so in the way in computer science speak i suppose the assembly universe is just like no laws of physics things can fly through mountains beyond the speed of light in in the assembly possible you have to apply the laws of physics but you can get access to all the motifs instantaneously with no effort so that means you could make anything then the assembly contingent says no you can't have access to the highly assembled object in the future until you've done the work in the past on the causal chain and that's really the really interesting shift where you go from assembly possible to assembly contingent that is really the key thing in assembly theory that says you cannot just have instantaneous access to all those memories you have to have done the work somehow the universe has to have somehow built a a system that allows you to select that path rather than other paths and then the final thing the assembly observed is basically are saying oh these are the things we actually see we can go backwards now and understand that they have been created by this this causal process wait wait a minute so when you say the universe has to construct the system that does the work is that like the environment that'll that that allows for like selection yeah yeah yes that's the thing that does the selection you could think about in terms of a von neumann constructor versus selection a ribosome tesla plant assembling teslas you know the the difference between the assembly universe in tesla land and the the the tesla factory is everyone says no teslas are just easy they just spring out you know how to make them all in a tesla factory you have to put things in sequence and out comes a tesla so you're talking about the factory yes this is this is really nice super important point is that when i talk about the universe having a memory or there's some magic it's not that it's that tells you that there must be a process encoded somewhere in physical reality be it a cell a tesla factory or something else that is making that object i'm not saying there's some kind of woo woo memory in the universe you know morphic resonance or something i'm saying that there is an actual causal process that is being directed constrained in some way so it's not kind of just making everything yeah but lee what's the factory that made the factory so what what is the so first of all you assume the laws of physics is just sprung to existence at the beginning those are constraints but what what makes the factory the environment that does the selection this is the question of well it's the first interesting question that i want to answer out of four i think the factory emerges in the the interplay between the environment and the objects that are being built mhmm and and here let me i'll have a go at explaining to you the the shortest path so why is the shortest path important imagine you've got i'm gonna have to go chemistry for a moment then abstract it so imagine you've got an a given environment that that you have a budget of atoms you're just flinging together yep and the the objective of those atoms that are being flung together in say molecule a have to make they they have they decompose so molecules decompose over time so the molecules in this environment in this magic environment have to not die but they do die there's a there's a they have a half life so the only way the molecules can get through that environment out the other side let's pretend the environment is a box it can go in and out without dying and there's a there's just an infinite supply of atoms coming or a well a large supply the the molecule gets built but the molecule that is able to template itself being built mhmm and survives in the environment will will basically reign supreme now let's say that that molecule takes ten steps now and it and it's using a finite set of atoms right or now let's say another molecule smart ass molecule we'll call it comes in yeah and can survive in that environment and can copy itself but it only needs five steps the molecule that only needs five steps because it's continue both molecules are being destroyed but they're creating themselves faster they can be destroyed you can see that the shortest path reigns supreme mhmm so the shortest path tells us something super interesting about the minimal amount of information required to propagate that motif in time and space and it's just like a kind of it seems to be like some kind of conservation law so one of the intuitions you have is the propagation of motifs in time will be done by the things that construct themselves in in the shortest path yeah so like you can assume that most of the objects in the universe are built in the shortest in the most efficient way the the so big leap i just took there yeah no yeah yeah yes and no because there are other things so in the limit yes because you want to tell the difference between things that have required a factory to build them and just random processes mhmm but you can find instances where the shortest path isn't taken for an individual object an individual function mhmm and people go ah that means the shortest path isn't right and then i say well i don't know i think it's right still because so of course because there are other driving forces it's not just one molecule now when you start to now you start to consider two objects you have a joint assembly space and it's not now it's a compromise between not just making a and b in the shortest path you wanna make a and b in the shortest path which might mean that a is slightly longer you have a compromise mhmm so when you see slightly more nesting in the construction when you take a given object that can look longer but that's because the overall function is the object is still trying to be efficient yeah and this is still very hand wavy and maybe have no legs to stand on but we think we're getting somewhere with that and there's probably some parallelization yeah right so this is all this is not sequential the building is yeah i i guess no you're right when you're when you're talking about complex objects you you don't have to work sequentially you can work in parallel you can get your friends together and they can yeah these and the the the thing we're working on right now is how to understand these parallel processes now there's an in a new thing we've introduced called assembly depth and assembly depth can be lower than the assembly index for a molecule when they're cooperating together because exactly this parallel processing is going on mhmm and my team have been working this out in the last few weeks because we're looking at what compromises does nature need to make when it's making molecules in a cell and i i wonder if you know i i'm maybe like well i'm always leaping out of my competence but in economics i'm just wondering if you could apply this in economic processes it seems like capitalism is very good at capitalism is very good at finding the shortest path mhmm you know every time but there are ludicrous things that happen because actually the cost function has been minimized and so i keep seeing parallels everywhere where there are complex nested systems where if you give it enough time and you introduce a bit of heterogeneity the system readjusts and finds a new shortest path but the shortest path isn't fixed on just one molecule now it's in the actual existence of the object over time and that object could be a city it could be a cell it could be a factory but i think we're going way beyond molecules and and my confidence probably should go back to molecules but hey alright before we get too far let's talk about the assembly equation okay how should we do this let me just even read that part of the paper we define assembly as the total amount of selection necessary to produce an ensemble of observed objects quantified using equation one the equation basically has a on one side which is the assembly of the ensemble mhmm and then a sum from one to n where n is the total number of unique objects and then there is a few variables in there that include the assembly index the copy number which we'll talk about that's an interesting i don't remember you talking about that that's an interesting addition and i think a powerful one it has to do with what that you can create pretty complex objects randomly mhmm and in order to know that they're not random that there's a factory involved you need to see a bunch of them yep that's that's the intuition there it's a interesting intuition and then some normalization what else is it and n minus one just to make sure that more than one object one object could be a one off and random yep and then you have more than one identical object that's interesting when when there's when there's two of a thing two of a thing is super important especially if the index assembly index is high so we could say several questions here one let's talk about selection what is this term selection what is this term evolution that we're referring to which which aspect of darwinian evolution are we referring to that's interesting here so yeah so this is probably what you know the paper we should talk about the paper for a second the paper did what it did is it kind of annoyed we didn't know it i mean it got intention and obviously angry peep the angry people were annoyed there's angry people in the world that's good so what happened is the evolutionary biologists got angry we were not expecting that because we thought evolutionary biologists would be cool i knew that some not many computational complexity people will get angry because i've kind of been poking them and maybe i deserved it but i was trying to poke them in a productive way mhmm and then the physicist kinda got grumpy because the initial conditions tell everything the prebiotic chemist got slightly grumpy because there's not enough chemistry in there then finally when the creationist said it wasn't creationist enough i was like i've done my job the phys well you're saying the physics they say because you're basically saying that physics is not enough to tell the story of how biology emerges i think so cassie said a few physics is the beginning and the end of the story yeah so what happened is the reason why people put the phone down on the call of their paper i mean if you if you view reading the paper like a phone call they got to the abstract yep and in the abstract it's first sentence is pretty the first two sentences caused everybody scientists have grappled with reconciling biological evolution with the immutable laws of the universe defined by physics true right there's nothing wrong with that statement totally true yeah sex these laws underpin life's origin evolution and the development of human culture and technology yet they do not predict the emergence of these phenomena wow first of all we should say the title of the paper this is paper was accepted and published in nature the title is assembly theory explains and quantifies selection and evolution very humble title and and the the the entirety of the paper i think presents interesting ideas but reaches high i am not i would do it all again this paper was actually on the preprint server for over a year you regret nothing yeah i i i think yeah i don't regret anything frank sinatra did it your way what i love about being a scientist is kind of sometimes i'm because i'm a bit dim i'm like and i don't understand what people are telling me i wanna get to the point this paper says hey laws of physics are really cool the universe is great but they don't really ex it's not intuitive that you just run the standard model and get life out i think most physicists might go yeah there's there's you know it's not just we can't just go back and say that's what happened because physics can't explain the origin of life yet does that doesn't mean it won't or can't okay just to be clear sorry intelligent designers we are gonna get there second point we say that evolution works but we don't know how evolution got going so biological evolution and biological selection so for me this seems like a simple continuum so when i mentioned selection and evolution in the title i think and in the abstract we should have maybe prefaced that and said non biological selection and non biological evolution sure and then that might have made it even more crystal clear but i didn't think that biology evolutionary biology should be so bold to claim ownership of selection and evolution and secondly a lot of evolutionary biologists seem to dismiss the origin of life questions they say is obvious and and that causes a real problem scientifically because when two different when the physicists are like we own the universe universe is good we explain all of it look at us and even biologists say we can explain biology and the poor chemist in the in the in the middle going but hang on mhmm and this paper kinda says hey there is an interesting disconnect between physics and biology and that's at the point at which memories get made in chemistry through bonds and hey let's look at this close and see if we can quantify it so yeah yeah i mean i i never expected the paper to to to kind of get that much interest and still i mean it's only been published just over a month ago now so just the link on the selection what is the broader sense of what selection means yeah that's a real good for selection selection so i think for selection you need so this is where for me the concept of an object is something that can persist in time and and not die but basically can be broken up mhmm so if so if i was gonna kind of bolster the definition of an object so so if and if something can form and persist for a a long period of time under an existing environment that could destroy other and i'm gonna use anthropomorphic terms i apologize that weaker objects or less robust then the environment could have selected that so good chemistry examples if you took some carbon and you made a a chain of carbon atoms whereas if you took some i don't know some carbon nitrogen and oxygen and made change from those you start to get different reactions and rearrangements so a carb a chain of carbon atoms might be more resistant to falling apart under acidic or basic conditions versus another set of molecules so it survives in that environment so the acid pond the molecule the the molecule the resistant molecule can get through and and then then that molecule goes into another environment so that environment now maybe being an acid bond is a basic bond or maybe it's an oxidizing bond and so if you've got carbon and it goes in oxidizing pond maybe the carbon starts to oxidize and break apart so you go through all these kind of obstacle courses if you like given by reality so selection is the ability happens when an object survives in your environment for some time but and this is the thing that's super subtle the object has to be continually being destroyed and made by process so it's not just about the process the object now it's about the process and time that makes it because a rock could just stand on the mountainside for four billion years and nothing happened to it and that's not necessarily really advanced selection so so for selection to get really interesting you need to have a turnover in time mhmm you need to be continually creating objects producing them what we call discovery time so there's a discovery time for an object when that object is discovered if it's say a molecule that can then act on itself or the chain of events that caused itself to bolster its formation then you go from discovery time to production time and suddenly you have more of it in the universe so it could be a self replicating molecule and the interaction of the molecule in the environment in the warm little pond or in the sea or wherever in the bubble could then start to build a proto factory the environment so really to answer your question what the factory is the factory is the environment but it's not very autonomous it's not very redundant there's lots of things that could go wrong so once you get high enough up the the the hierarchy of networks of interactions something needs to happen that needs to be compressed into a smaller volume and made resistant robust because in biology selection and evolution is robust that you have error correction built in you have really you know there's good ways of basically making sure propagation goes on so really the difference between inorganic abiotic selection evolution and evolution and stuff in biology is robustness the ability to to kind of propagate over over in the the ability to survive in lots of different environments mhmm whereas our poor little inorganic soul molecule whatever just dies in lots of different environments so there's something super special that happens from the inorganic environment molecule in the environment that kills it to where you've got evolution and cells can survive everywhere how special is that how do you know those kinds of evolution factors on everywhere in the universe i i don't and i'm excited because i think selection isn't special at all i think what is special is the history of the environments on earth that gave rise to the first cell that now has you know has taken all those environments and is now more autonomous and i would like to think that you know this paper could be very wrong but i don't think it's very wrong i mean it's certainly wrong but it's less wrong than some other ideas i hope right and if this allow inspires us to go and look for selection in the universe because we now have an equation or we can say we can look for selection going on and say oh that's interesting we seem to have a pros process that's giving that's giving us high copy number objects that also are highly complex mhmm but that doesn't look like life as we know it and we use that and say oh there's a hydrothermal vent oh there's a process going on there's molecular networks because the assembly equation is not only meant to identify at the higher end advanced selection what you get i record in biology you super advanced selection and even i mean you could use the assembly equation to look for technology and mhmm god forbid we could talk about consciousness and abstraction but let's keep it primitive molecules and biology so i think the real power of the assembly equation is to is to say how much selection is going on in this space mhmm and there's there's a really simple thought experiment i could do if you you know have a little petri dish and on that petri dish you put some simple food mhmm so the assembly index of all the sugars and everything is quite low so then and you put a single e co cell of e e coli cell yeah and then you say i'm gonna i'm gonna measure the assembly in this amount of assembly in the box so it's quite low but the rate of change of assembly d a d t will go as it eats all the food and the number of coli cells will re will replicate because they take all the food they copy themselves the assembly index of all the molecules goes up up up and up until the food is exhausted in the box so now the now the e coli's stopped i mean die is probably a strong word they stop respiring because all the food is gone but suddenly the amount of assembly in the box has gone up gigantically because of that one e coli factory has just eaten through milled lots of other e coli factories run out of food and stopped and so that looking at that so in the initial box although the amount of assembly was really small it was able to replicate and use all the food and go up and that's what we're trying to do in the lab actually is kinda make those kind of experiments and and see if we can spot the emergence of molecular networks that are producing molecules and and and really that's the main kind of idea for the entire paper yeah and see if you can measure the changes in the assembly index throughout the whole system yeah okay what what about if if i show up to a new planet we'll go to mars or some other planet from a different solar system and how do we use assembly index there to discover alien life in very simply actually if we let's say we'll go to mars with a mass spectrometer with a sufficiently high resolution so what you have to be able to do so good thing about mass spec is that you can select the molecule from the mass and then if it's high enough resolution you can be more and more sure that you're just seeing identical copies you can count them and then you fragment them and you count the number of fragments and look at the molecular weight and the higher the molecular weight and the higher the number of the fragments the higher the assembly index so if you go to mars and you take a mass spec or high enough resolution and you can find molecules and i'll give guide on earth if you could find molecules say greater than three hundred and fifty molecular weight or more than fifteen fragments you have found artifacts that can only be produced at least on earth by life now you would say oh well maybe the geological process i would argue very vehemently that that is not the case but we can say look if you don't like the cutoff on earth go up higher thirty a hundred mhmm right because there's gonna be a point where you'll find a molecule with so many different parts the chances of you getting a molecule that has a hundred different parts and finding a million identical copies you know that's that's just impossible that could never happen in an infinite set of universes can you just linger on this copy number thing a million different copies what do you mean by copies and why is the number of copies important yeah that that was so interesting and i always understood the copy number is really important but i never explained it properly for ages and it i kept having this it goes back to this if i give you a i don't know a really complicated molecule and i say it's complicated you could say hey that's really complicated but is it just really random mhmm and so so i realized that ultimate randomness and ultimate complexity are indistinguishable until you can you can see a structure in the randomness so you can see copies so copies implies structure yeah the factoring i mean there's a deep profound thing in there because like if you just have a random random process you're going to get a lot of complex beautiful sophisticated things mhmm what makes them complex in the way we think life is complex or yeah something like a a factory that's operating under a selection processes there should be copies is there like some looseness about copies like what does it mean for two objects to be equal it it's it's all to do with the the telescope or the microscope you're using and so at the the maximum resolution so in the nice thing about the nice thing about chemists is they have this concept of the molecule and they're all familiar with the molecule and molecules you can hold you know in your hand and lots of them mhmm identical copies a molecule is actually a super important thing in chemistry to say look you can have a mole of a molecule so an avogadro's number of molecules and they're identical what does that mean that means that the molecular composition the bonding and so on the configuration is all is is indistinguishable you can hold them together you can overlay them so the way i do it is if i say here's a bag of ten identical molecules let's prove they're identical you pick one out of the the out of the bag and you basically observe it using some technique and then you put it you take it away and then you put take another one out if you observe it using technique you can see no differences they're identical it's really interesting to get right because if you take say two molecules molecules can be in different vibrational rotational states they're moving all the time so with this respect identical molecules have identical bonding mhmm in this case we don't even talk about chirality because we don't have a chirality detector so two identical molecules in one conception assembly theory basically considers both hands as being the same but of but of course they're not they're different as soon as you have a chiral to distinguish her detect to detect the left and the right hand they become different and so it's to do with the detection system that you have and the resolution so i wonder if there's an art and size to the which detection system is used when you show up to a new planet yeah yeah yeah so like you you're talking about chemistry a lot today we have kind of standardized detection systems right of how to compare molecules so you know when you start to talk about emojis and language and mathematical theorems and i don't know more sophisticated things at a different scale at a smaller scale than molecules at a larger scale than molecules like what detection like if if we look at the difference between you and me lexantly are we the same are we different sure i mean of course we're different close-up but if you zoom out a little bit we'll morphologically look the same yeah not not you know height and characteristics hair length stuff like that well well also like the species and yeah yeah yeah and and also there's a sense why we're both from earth yeah i i agree i mean this is the power of assembly theory in that regard that you if if you so so if everything so the way to look at it if you have a box of objects if they're all if they're all indistinguishable then using your technique you then you what you then do is you then look at the assembly index now if the assembly index of them is really low right and they're all they're all indistinguishable then you've then it's telling you that you have to go to another resolution so that would be you know it's kind of a sliding scale it's kind of nice so you got it so those two kind of are attention with each other yeah the the number of copies and the assembly index yeah that's really really interesting so okay so you show up to a new planet you'll be doing what i would do mass spec i would bring it on a sample of what like first of all like how big of a scoop do you take did you just take a scoop like what like so we're looking for primitive life i would i would look yeah so if you're just going to mars or titan or enceladus or somewhere so so a number of ways of doing it so you could take a large scoop or you go for the atmosphere and detect stuff so and you could make a light a life meter right so one of sarah's colleagues at asu paul davies keeps calling it a life me a life meter which is quite a nice idea because you think about it if you've got a living system that's producing these highly complex molecules and they drift away and they're in a highly kind of demanding environment they could be burnt right so they could just be falling apart so you want to sniff a little bit of complexity and say warmer warmer warmer oh we found life we found the alien we found we found the alien elon musk smoking a joint in the bottom of the cave on mars or elon himself whatever right you say okay found it so what you can do is a mass spectrometer you could just look for things in the gas phase or you go on the surface drill down because you want to find molecules that are where you you've either got to find the source living system because the problem with just looking for complexity is it gets burned away so in a harsh environment on on on say on the mar surface of mars there's a very low probability that you're gonna find really complex molecules because of all the radiation and so on mhmm if you drill down a little bit you could drill down a bit into into soil that's billions of years old then i would put in some solvent water alcohol or something or take a a scoop put it in put it make it volatile put it into the mass spectrometer and just try and detect mhmm a high complexity high abundant molecules and if you get them hey presto you can have evidence of life mhmm wouldn't that then be great if you could say okay we've found evidence of life now we want to keeps keep the life meter keep searching for more and more complexity until you actually find living cells you can get those new living cells and then and then you could bring them back to earth or you could try and sequence them you could see that they have different dna and proteins go on the gradient of the life meter exactly how would you build a life meter let's say we're together starting a new a new company launching a life meter mass spectrometer would be the first way of doing it just a no no no but that's that's that's one of the major components of it but i'm talking about like what if it's a device we got it and and branding logo we're gonna talk about that that's later but what's the input what's the like how do you get to the a metered output so i would i would take a lie so my my life meter our life meter here you go thank you yeah you're welcome would have both infrared and mass spec so it would have two ports so we could shine the light and so what it would do is you would have a a vacuum chamber and you would have an electrostatic analyzer mhmm and you'd have a monochromator to producing infrared you'd add the sump so you take a scoop of the sample put it in the life meter it would then add a solvent or heat up the sample so some volatiles come off the volatiles would then be put into the into the mass spectrometer into electrostatic trap and you'd weigh the molecules and fragment them alternatively you'd shine infrared light on them and you count the number of bands but you'd have to in that case do some separation because you wanna separate and so in mass spec it's really nice and convenient because you can separate electrostatically but you need to have that can you do it in real time yeah pretty much pretty much yeah so let's go all the way back so let's okay we're really gonna get this let's go the lexus life meet lex and lee's no no excellent it's a good it's a good good good ring to it alright so you have a you have a vacuum chamber you have a little nose the nose would have some as a a a packing material so you would take your your sample add it onto the nose add a solvent or a gas it would then be sucked up the nose and that would be separated as using chrome what we call chromatography and then as each band comes off the nose we'll then do mass spec and infrared and in the account in the in the case of infrared count the number of bands in the case of mass spec count the number of fragments and weigh it and then the further up in molecular weight range for the mass spec and the number of bands you go up and up and up from the you know dead interesting interesting over the threshold oh my gosh earth life and then right up to the batshit crazy this is definitely you know alien intelligence that's made this life right you could almost go all the way there same with infrared and it's pretty simple the thing that is really problematical is that for many years decades what people have done and i can't blame them is they've rather they've been obsessing about small biomarkers on that we find on earth amino acids like single amino acids or evidence of small molecules and these things and looking for those run looking for complexity they well the be if the beautiful thing about this is you can look for complexity without earth chemistry bias or earth biology bias so assembly theory is just a way of saying hey complexity and abundance is evidence of selection that's how our universal life meter will work complexity and abundance is evidence of selection okay so let's apply our life meter to earth so what you know if we were just to apply assembly index measurements to earth what what what kind of stuff we're going to be get are going to get what's impressive about some of the complexity on earth so we did this a few years ago in the when i was trying to convince nasa and colleagues that this technique could work and honestly it's so funny because everyone's like no it ain't gonna work and i was just like because the chemist was saying of course there are complicated molecules out there you can detect that just form randomly i was like really that's like that was like you know that's a bit like a i don't know someone saying of course darwin textbook was just written randomly by some monkeys and a typewriter i was just for me it was like really and and and i pushed a lot on the chemist now and i think most of them are on board but not totally i really really had some big arguments but the copy number caught there because i think i confused the chemist by saying one off and then when i made clear about the copy number i think that made it a little bit easier just to clarify yeah a chemist might say that of course out there outside of earth there's complex molecules yes okay and then you're saying wait a minute that's like saying of course there's aliens out there like you yeah exactly that okay exactly but you're you're saying you clarify that that's actually a very interesting question and we should be looking for complex molecules of which the copy number is two or greater yeah exactly so on earth so coming back to earth what we did is we took a whole bunch of samples we and we were running prebiotic chemistry experiments in the lab we took various inorganic minerals and extracted them look at the volatile because there's a special way of treating minerals and polymers in assembly theory where what in this in our life machine we're looking at molecules we don't care about polymers because they don't they're not volatile you can't hold them they're not how how can you make if you can't assert that they're identical then it's very difficult for you to to to work out if there's undergone selection or they're just a random mess same with some minerals but we can come back to that so basically what you do we got a whole load of samples inorganic ones we got a load of we got scotch whisky and i also got nice took aardbeg which is one of my favorite whiskies which is very peaty and another what does peaty mean it's like so the way that on on in scotland in islay which is little island the the the the the scotch the whisky is let to mature in barrels and the the it said that the peat you know the the the the complex molecules in the peat might find their way through into the whiskey and that's what gives it this intense brown color and really complex flavor it's literally molecular complexity that does that mhmm and so you know vodka is the complete opposite it's just pure right with the the better the whiskey the higher the esomeone index the the higher the esomeone index the better the whiskey that's what i mean i really love deep peaty scottish whiskies near my house there is a a low one of the the lowland distilleries called glengoyne still beautiful whiskey but not as complex so for fun i cook took some glengoyne whiskey in our bag and put them into the mass spec and measure the assembly index i also got e coli so the way we do it take the e coli break the cell apart take it all apart and also got some beer and and people were ridiculing us saying oh beer is evidence of complexity one of the one of the computational complexity people was just throwing yeah we kind of kind of he's very vigorous in his disagreement of assembly theory was just saying you know you don't know what you're doing even beer is more complicated than human what he didn't realize is that it's not beer per se it's taking the yeast extract taking the extract breaking the cells extracting the molecules and just looking at the profile of the molecules see if there's anything over the threshold and we also put in a really complex molecule taxol so we took all of these but also nasa gave us i think five samples and they wouldn't tell us what they are they said no we don't believe you can get this to work and they really you know they gave us some super complex samples and they gave us two fossils one that was a million years old and one was at ten thousand years old see something from antarctica seabed they gave us a mertrasine meteorite and a few others put them through the system so i we we took all the samples treat them all identically put them into mass spec fragmented them counted and in this case implicit in the measurement was we you in mass spec you only detect peaks when you've got more than say let's say ten thousand identical molecules so the copy number is already baked in but wasn't quantified which is super important there this is in the first paper because i was like it's abundant of course and when you then took it all out we found that the biological samples gave you molecules that had an assembly index greater than fifteen and all the abiotic samples were less than fifteen and then we took the nasa samples and we looked at the ones that were more than fifteen less than fifteen and we gave them back to nasa and they're like oh gosh yep dead living dead living you got it and and that's what we found on earth that's a success yeah oh yeah resounding success well can can you just go back to the beer and the e coli so what what's the assembly index on those so what you were able to do is like the assembly index of we found high assembly index molecules originating from the beer sample and the e coli sample so the yeast and the beer i mean there there there were i didn't know which one was higher we we didn't really do any detail there because now we are doing that because one of the things we've done it's a secret but i can tell you i think it's no nobody's listening well is that we've just mapped the tree of life using assembly theory mhmm because everyone said oh that you can't do it from biology and what we're able to do is so you i think there's three way well two ways of doing tree of life traffic well three ways actually yeah what's the tree of life so the tree of life is basically tracing back the history of life on earth for all different species going back what who evolved from what and it all goes all the way back to the first kind of life forms and they branch off and like you have plant kingdom the animal kingdom the fungi kingdom you know and different and different branches all the way up and the way this was classically done and i'm no evolutionary biologist the evolution biologists are very tell me every day at least ten times i wanna be one though i kinda like biology it's kinda cool but yeah it's very cool but basically evolutionary what what darwin and mendeleev and all these people do is just they draw pictures right and they they tax it they just con they were able to draw pictures and and say and say oh these look like common classes yeah then they're artists really they're just you know but they've they've but they're they're able to find out a lot right in looking at verberates and verberates camera and explosion all this stuff and then then came the genomic revolution and suddenly everyone used gene sequencing and craig venter is a good example i think he's gone around the world in his yacht just taking up samples looking for new species where he's just found new species of life just from sequencing it's amazing so you have taxonomy you have sequencing and then you can also do a little bit of kind of molecular kind of archaeology like you know measure the samples and and kind of form some inference what we did is we were able to fingerprint so we took a load of random samples from all of biology and we use mass spectrometry and what we did now is not just look for individual molecules but we looked for coexisting molecules where they had to look at their joint assembly space and where we where we were able to cut them apart and and undergo recursion in the mass spec and infer some relationships and we're able to recapitulate the tree of life using mass spectroscopy mhmm no sequencing and no drawing alright can you try to say that again with a little more detail so recreating what does it take to recreate the tree of life what does the reverse engineering process look like here so what you do is you take an unknown sample you plug it into the mass spec you get a because this comes from what you ask like what do you see in e coli mhmm and so in e coli you don't just see it's not it's not it's not that the most sophisticated cells on on earth make the most sophisticated molecules it is the coexistence of lots of complex molecules above a threshold mhmm and so what we realize is you could fingerprint different life forms so fungi make really complicated molecules why because they can't move they have to make everything on-site mhmm whereas you know some animals are like lazy they can just go eat the fungi you know they don't need to to make very much and i and so what you do is you look at the so you take i don't know the fingerprint maybe the top number of high molecular weight molecules you find in the sample you fragment them to get their assembly indices and then what you can do is you can infer common origins of molecules you can do a kind of molecular when the reverse engineering of the assembly space you can infer common roots and look at what's called the joint assembly space but what let's translate that into the experiment take a sample bung it in the mass spec take the top say ten molecules fragment them and then and that gives you one fingerprint then you do it for another sample you get another fingerprint now the question is you say hey are these samples the same or different and that's what we've been able to do and by basically looking at the assembly space that these molecules create without any knowledge of assembly theory you are unable to do it we have a knowledge of assembly theory you can cons reconstruct the tree how does how does knowing if they're the same or different give you the tree let's go to two leaves on different branches on the tree right what you can do by counting the number of differences you can estimate how far away their origin was got it and that's all we do and it just works but when we realized you could even use assembly theory to recapitulate the tree of life with no gene sequencing we were like so this this is looking at samples that exist today in the world what about like things that are no longer exist i mean the tree contains information about the past i would some of it is gone yeah yeah absolutely i would love to get old fossil samples and apply assembly theory mass spec and see if we can find new forms of life that have that are no longer amenable to gene sequencing because the dna is all gone because dna dna and rna is quite unstable but some of them are complex molecules it might be there it might give you a hint of something new or wouldn't it be great if you sure if you find a sample that's worth really persevering and doing you know doing the proper extraction to re to you know pcr and so on and then sequence it and then put it together so when a thing dies you can still get some information about its complexity yeah and we can and it appears that you can do some dating now there are really good techniques there's radiocarbon dating there is longer dating going looking at radioactive minerals and so on and you can also in bone you can look at the what happens in after something dies is the the you get what's called racemization where the the the chirality in the polymers basically changes and you just get you get decomposition and the rate of the deviation from the pure enantiomer to the mixture you can have a it gives you a time time scale on it a half life so you can date when it died i wanna use assembly theory to to see if i can date use it date death and things and and trace the tree of life and also decomposition of molecules do you think it's possible oh yeah then without a doubt it may not be better than what because like the i was just at a conference where there's some brilliant people looking at isotope enrichment and and looking at how life en enriches isotopes and they're really sophisticated stuff that they're doing but i think there's some fun to be had there because we it gives you another dimension of dating how old is this molecule mhmm in terms of and or more importantly how long ago was this molecule produced by life mhmm the more complex a molecule the more life also does is it enriches as you get older the the amount of carbon thirteen in you goes up mhmm because of the because of the way the metabolite because of the way the the bonding is in in carbon thirteen so it has a slightly different strength bond strength than you it's called the kinetic isotope effect so you can literally date how old you are you know or when you stop metabolizing so you could date someone's debt how old they are i think i'm making this up this might be right but i think it's roughly right the amount of carbon thirteen you have in you you can kind of estimate how how old you are how old living organisms are or living organisms you could say oh this person is ten years old and this person's thirty years old because they've been metabolizing more carbon and they've accumulated it yeah that's the basic idea it's probably completely wrong time scale signatures of of chemistry are fascinating so you've been saying a lot of chemistry examples for assembly theory what if we zoom out and look at a bigger scale of an object mhmm you know like really complex objects like humans or living organisms that are made up of you know millions or billions of other organisms how how do you try to apply assembly theory to that at the moment we're with we should be able to do this to morphology in cells so we're looking at cell surfaces and really i'm trying to extend further it's just that you know we work so hard to get this paper out and people to start discussing the ideas and i was and i but but it's kinda funny because i think the the the penny is falling on this so yeah so what does that even what what what does it mean for a penny to be oh i mean the the the penny's dropped right because a lot of people were like it's rubbish it's rubbish you've insulted me it's wrong and and then you know i mean the paper got published on the fourth of october mhmm it had two point three million engagements on twitter mhmm right and it's been downloaded over a few hundred thousand times and someone actually said to me wrote to me and said this is an example of really bad writing and what not to do and i was like if all of my papers got read this much because that's the objective if i have a publishing paper i want people to read it i wanna write that badly again yeah i don't know what's the deep inside here about the negativity in the space i think it's probably the immune system of the scientific community making sure that there's no bullshit that gets published that's and then it it can overfire it can do a lot of damage it can shut down conversations in a way that's not productive we and i'll go back i mean i'll answer your question about the hierarchy and assembly but let's go back to the reception people saying the paper was badly written i mean of course we could improve it we can always improve for clarity let's go there before we go to the hierarchy yeah you know it has been criticized quite a bit the paper what has been some criticism that you found most powerful like that you can understand and can you explain it the yes the most exciting criticism came from the evolutionary biologist telling me that they thought that that it would origin of life was a solved problem and i was like woah we're really onto something because it's clearly not and then when you poke them on that they just said no you don't understand evolution and i said no no i don't think you understand that evolution had to occur before biology and we need there's a gap that was really for me that misunderstanding and that that did cause an immune response which was really interesting the second thing was the fact that physicists well the physicists were actually really polite right really nice about it but they just said we're not really sure about the initial conditions thing but this is a really big debate that we should certainly get into because you know the in the the the emergence of life was not encoded in the initial conditions of the universe mhmm and it can't and i think assembly theory shows why it can't be i'll say okay say that sure you if you could say that again i the the the origin of the the emergence of life was not and cannot in principle be encoded in the initial conditions of the universe just to clarify what you mean by life is like what high assembly index objects yeah and this goes back to your favorite subject what's that time right so why so why what what does time have to do with it we i mean probably we can come back to it later but i yeah i think it might be if we have time yeah but i think that i've i think i now understand how to explain how you know lots of people got angry with the assembly paper but also the the ramifications of this is how time is fundamental in the universe and and this notion of commentarial spaces mhmm and there are so many layers on this but you have to become an it's i think you have to become an intuitionist mathematician mhmm and you have to abandon platonic mathematics mhmm and also platonic mathematics has left physics astray but there's a lot to unpack there so we can go to the platonic mathematics okay hey there's there's a there's a it's okay the evolutionary biologists criticized because the origin of life is understood the the and not it it doesn't require an explanation that involves physics yeah it does their statement well i mean it was i said they said lots of confusing statements basically i realized the evolutionary biology community that were vocal and some of them were really rude really spiteful mhmm and needlessly so right because look you know i i i didn't people misunderstand publication as well some of the people just said how dare this be published in nature this is you know how what a terrible journal and and i and it really and i watched certain people look this is a brand new idea that's not only potentially going to change the way we look at biology it's gonna change the way we look at the universe and everyone's like saying how dare you how dare you be so grandiose i'm like no no no this is not hype we're not we're not like saying we've invented some i don't know we've discovered alien in a closet somewhere just for hype we've genuinely mean this to genuinely have the impact or ask the question and the way people jumped on that was a really bad precedent for young people who wanna actually do something new because this makes a bold claim and the chances are that it's not correct but what i wanted to do is a couple of things is i wanted to make a bold claim that was precise and testable and correctable not a wooly another wooly information in biology argument information turing machine blah blah blah blah blah a concrete series of statements that can be falsified mhmm and explored and either the theory could be destroyed or built upon well what about the criticism of you're just putting a bunch of sexy names on something that's already obvious yeah that's really good so so the assembly index of a molecule is not obvious no one had measured it before and no one has thought to con quantify selection complexity and copy number before in such a primitive quantifiable way mhmm i think the nice thing about this paper this paper is is a tribute to all well not to all the people that understand that that biology does something very interesting some people call it negentropy some people call it think about you know organizational principles that lots of people were not shocked by the paper because they'd done it before a lot of the lot of the arguments we got some people said oh it's rubbish oh by the way i had this idea twenty years before i was like which one if if is it your the rubbish part or the really revolutionary part so this kind of plucks two strings at once it plucked the there is something interesting the biology is as we can see around this but we haven't quantified yet and what this is the first stab at quantifying that so the the the the fact that people said this is obvious but it's also so if so if it's obvious why have you not done it sure but the there's there's a few things to say there one is you know this is in part of a philosophical framework because you know it's not like you can apply this generally to any object in the universe it's very chemistry focused yeah well i think you will be able to we just haven't got there robustly so we can say how can we let's go up a level so if we go up from level we go up let's go up from molecules to cells because you jump to people and i jump to emoticons and both are good and and they will be assemblies thick with cells yeah so we go from if we go from so if we go from molecules to assemblies and let's take a cellular assembly a nice thing about a cell is you can tell the difference between a eukaryote and a prokaryote right the the organelles are specialized differently when they look at the cell surface the cell surface has different glycosylation patterns and these cells will stick together now let's go up a level in multicellular creatures you have cellular differentiation now if you think about how embryos develop you go all the way back those cells undergo differentiation in a causal way that's biomechanically a feedback between the genetics biomechanics i think we can use assembly theory to apply to tissue types we can even apply it to different cell disease types so that's what we're doing next but we're trying to walk you know the thing is i'm trying to leap ahead i wanna leap ahead to go well we apply it to culture mhmm but clearly you can apply it to memes and culture and we've also applied assembly theory to cas mhmm and not as you think cellular automaton but yeah yeah to say not just as you think different ca rules were invented by different people at different times mhmm and one of my one of my coworkers very talented chap basically was like oh i can realize that different people had different ideas with different rules and they copied each other and made slightly different bit different cellular automata rules and they and pub and looked at them online mhmm and so he was able to refer an assembly index and copy number of rule whatever doing this thing but i digress mhmm but it does show you can apply it at a higher scale so what do we need to do to apply assembly theory to things we need to agree there's a common set of building blocks so in a cell well in a in a multicellular creature you need to look back in time mhmm so there is the the initial cell which the creature is fertilized and then starts to grow and then there is cell differentiation and you have to then make that causal chain both on those that requires development of the organism in time mhmm or if you look at the cell surfaces and the cell types they've got different features on the cell what the walls and inside the cell so we're building up but obviously i want a leap to things like emoticons language mathematical theories but that's a very large number of steps to get from a molecule to the human brain yeah and i think they are related but in hierarchies of emergence right so you shouldn't compare them i mean the assembly index of a human brain what does that even mean well maybe we can look at the morphology of the human brain say all human brains have these number of features in common mhmm if they have those number of and then let's look at a brain in in a a whale or a dolphin or a chimpanzee or a bird say okay let's look at the assembly indices number of features in these and now the copy number is just the number of how many birds are there how many chimpanzees are there how many humans are there but then you have to discover for that the features that you would be looking for yeah and that means you need to have a you need to have some idea of the anatomy but is there an automated way to discover features i i guess so i mean and i think this is a a good way to apply machine learning and image recognition just to basically characterize things to apply compression to it to see what emerges and then use the thing the features used as part of the compression as the measurement of as the thing that is searched for when you're measuring assembly index and copy number and and the compression has to be remember the assembly universe which is you have to go from assembly possible to assembly contingent and that jump from because assembly possible all possible brains all possible features all the time but we know that on the tree of life and also on the lineage of life going back to luca the human brain just didn't spring into existence yesterday it is a long lineage of brains going all the way back mhmm and so if we could do assembly theory to understand the development not just in evolutionary history but in biological development as you you grow we are gonna learn something more what would be amazing is if you can use assembly theory this framework to show the increase in the assembly index associated with i don't know cultures or pieces of text like language yeah or images and so on and illustrate without knowing the data ahead of time just kinda like you did with nasa that you're able to demonstrate that it applies in those other contexts i mean and that you know probably wouldn't at first and you have to evolve the theory somehow you have to change it you have to expand it you know i think so but like that i guess this is as a paper a first step in saying okay can we create a general framework for measuring complexity of objects for measuring life the complexity of living organisms yeah that's that's what this is reaching for that is the first step and also to say look we have a way of quantifying selection and evolution in a in a fairly in a fairly not mundane but a fairly mechanical way yeah because before now is you know this it wasn't very the ground truth for it was very subjective mhmm whereas here we're talking about clean observables and there's gonna be layers on that i mean we're with collaborators right now we already think we can do assembly theory on language and not only that wouldn't it be great if we can put so the if we can figure out how under pressure language is gonna evolve and be more efficient because you're gonna wanna transmit things and again it's not just about compression it is about understanding how you can make the most of the in the architecture you've already built mhmm and i think this is something beautiful that evolution does we're we're reusing those architectures we can't just abandon our evolutionary history mhmm and this if you don't wanna abandon your evolutionary history and you and you know that evolution has been happening then assembly theory works and i think that's that's a key comment i wanna make is that assembly theory is great for understanding where evolution has been used mhmm the next jump is when we go to technology because of course if you take the m three processor i wanna buy i haven't bought one yet i can't justify it but i want it at some point the m three processor arguably is there's quite a lot of features a quite large number the m two came before it then the m one all the way back you can apply assembly theory to microprocessor architecture it doesn't take a huge leap to see that i'm a linux guy by the way so your examples go way over yeah well whatever is that is that like a is that a fruit company of some sort i don't even know yeah there's a lot of interesting stuff to ask about language like you could look at how would that work you could look at gpt one gpt two gpt three three five four and try to analyze the kind of language it produces i mean that's almost trying to look at assembly index of in intelligent systems yeah i mean i think the thing about large language models and and this is a whole hobby horse i have at the moment mhmm is that obviously they're they're all about the the the the evidence of evolution in the in the in the large language model comes from all the people that produced all the language and that's really interesting and all the corrections in the in the in the mechanical turk right sure and and so that's part of the history part of the memory of the system exactly so you can you so so it would be really interesting to basically use an assembly based approach to to making language in a hierarchy right i think it's my guess is that you could we might be able to build a new type of large language model that uses assembly theory that it has more understanding of the past and how things were created well basically the thing with llms is they're like everything everywhere all at once splat mhmm and make the user happy so there's not much intelligence in the model the model is how the human interacts with the model but wouldn't it be great if we could understand how to embed more intelligence in the in the system what do you mean by intelligence there like you seem to associate intelligence with history yeah well i memory i think selection produces intelligence wait wait you're almost implying that selection is intelligence no yeah kind of i would go that i would go out on a limb and say that but i think it's a little bit more human beings have the ability to abstract and they can break beyond selection and this is what like darwinian selection mhmm because a human being doesn't have to basically do trial and error like but they can think about it and say oh that's a bad idea i won't do that and then technologies and so on so we escaped darwinian evolution and now we're on to some other kind of evolution i guess higher yeah higher level evolution and that and then we'll we'll assembly theory will measure that as well right because it's all a lineage okay another lineage okay another piece of criticism or by way of question is how is assembly theory or maybe assembly index different from kolmogorov complexity so for people who don't know kolmogorov complexity of an object is the length of a shortest computer program that produces the object as output yeah i'm i i seem to there seems to be a disconnect between the computational approaches so yeah so a kolmogorov measure requires a turing machine mhmm requires a computer and that's one thing and the other thing is assembly theory is supposed to trace the process by which life evolution emerged right this is the main thing there there are lots of other layers so so kolmogorov complexity you can you can approximate kolmogorov complexity but it's not really telling you very much about the actual it it's really telling you about like your date your dataset compression of your dataset sure and so that doesn't really help you identify the the turtle in this case is the computer mhmm and so what assembly theory does is i i'm gonna say this is a trigger warning for anyone listening who's who loves complexity theory i think that we're gonna show that ait is a very important subset of assembly theory because here's what happens the i think that assembly theory allows us to build go understand when the selection's occurring selection produces factories and things factories in the end produce computers and you can go then algorithmic information theory comes out of that the frustration i've had with with looking at life through this kind of information theory is it doesn't take into account causation so the main difference between yeah assembly theory and all these complexity measures is there's no causal chain yeah and and i think that's the main as the causal chain is at the at the at the core of assembly theory exactly and if you're in if you've got all your data in a computer memory all the data is the same you can access it in the same way there's you don't care you just compress it and and you either look at the program run time or the shortest program and that for me it can it it is absolutely not capturing what it is what its selection does but but assembly theory looks at objects it doesn't have information about the object history it's going to try to infer that history by looking for the shortest history right like the object the object doesn't like have a a wikipedia page that goes with it oh i would about its history i would say it does in a way and it is fascinating to look at so you've just got the object mhmm and you have no other information about the object what assembly theory allows you to do with just with the object is to and and the the word infer is correct i agree with infer so there's you're like say well that's not the that's not the history but but something really interesting comes from this the shortest path is inferred from the object mhmm that is the worst case scenario if you have no machine to make it so that tells you about the depth of that object in time mhmm and so what assembly theory allows you to do is without considering any other circumstances to say from this object how deep is this object in time if we just treat the object as itself without any other any other constraints and that's super powerful because the shortest path then says allows you to say oh this object wasn't just created randomly there was a process and so assembly theory is not meant to you know one up ait or to ignore the factory it's just to say it's just to say hey there was a factory mhmm that and how big was that factory and how deep in time is it mhmm but it's still computationally very difficult to compute that history right for complex objects it it it is it becomes harder one of the things that's super nice is that it constrains your initial conditions right sure it constrains where you're gonna be so if you take say imagine so one of the things we're doing right now is applying assembly theory to drug discovery mhmm now what everyone's doing right now is taking all the proteins and looking at the proteins and and looking at molecules doctor proteins why not instead take the look at the molecules that are involved interacting with the receptors over time mhmm rather thinking about and use the molecules evolve over time as a proxy for how the proteins evolved over time mhmm and then use that to constrain your drug discovery process you flip the problem one eighty and focus on the molecule evolution mhmm rather than the protein and so you can guess in the future what might happen so that so that so you rather than having to consider all possible molecules you know where to focus and that's the same thing if you're looking at an assembly spaces for an object where you don't know the entire history but you know that you know in the history of this object it's not gonna have some other motif that there that it doesn't apply it doesn't appear in the past but just even for the drug discovery point you made isn't don't you have to simulate all of chemistry for to figure out how to come up with constraints no in the molecules and the no i mean i don't i don't know enough about protein for this this is another thing that i think causes because this paper goes across so many boundaries so chemists have looked at this and said this is not a this is not a react this is not correct reaction i was like no it's a graph sure there's there's assembly index and shortest path examples here on chemistry yeah and so and what you do is you look at the minimal constraints on that graph of course it has some mapping to the synthesis but actually you don't have to know all of chemistry you just have to under you can build up the constraint space rather nicely mhmm but this is just at the beginning right there are so many directions this could go in and as i said it it could all be wrong but hopefully it's less wrong what about the little criticism i saw of do you by way of question do you consider the different probabilities of each reaction in the chain so like that there could be different when you look at a chain of events that led up to the creation of an object doesn't it matter that some parts in the chain are less likely than others no it doesn't matter no no well let's go back so no not less likely but react so so so no so let's go back to what we're talk looking at here so the assembly index is the minimal path that could have created that object probabilistically so imagine you have all your atoms in a plasma you got enough energy you got enough there's collisions what is the quickest way you could zip out that molecule with no reaction constraints how do you define quickest there then it's just basically what walk on a random graph yeah do you so we make an assumption that basically the time scale for forming the bonds mhmm so no i don't wanna say that because it's gonna have people getting obsessing about this point and your criticism is a really good one what we're trying to say is like this is this puts a lower bound on something mhmm of course some reactions are less possible than others but actually i don't think chemical reactions exist oh boy what does that mean okay why don't chemical reactions exist i'm writing a paper right now that that i keep being told i have to finish and it's called the origin of chemical reactions mhmm and it merely says that reactivity exists as controlled by the laws of quantum mechanics mhmm and reactions we put name chemists put names on reactions like so you could have like i don't know the wittig reaction which is by you know wittig you could have the suzuki reaction which is by suzuki mhmm now what are these reactions so these reactions are constrained by the following they're constrained by the fact they're on planet earth one g mhmm two nine eight kelvin one bar so these are constraints mhmm they're also constrained by the chemical composition of earth oxygen availability all this stuff and that then allows us to focus in our chemistry so when a chemist does a reaction that's a really nice compressed shorthand for constraint application glass flask pure reagent mhmm temperature pressure boom boom boom boom boom control control control control control so of course we have bond energies yes this so the bond energies are kind of intrinsic in a vacuum if you say the so the bond energy you have to have a bond mhmm and so for assembly theory to work you have to have a bond which means that bond has to give the molecule a certain half a half life so you're probably gonna find later on that some bonds are weaker and that you are gonna miss in mass spectra when you count look at the assembly of some molecules you're gonna miscount the assembly of the molecule because it falls apart too quickly because the bonds just form but you can solve that with looking infrared so so when people think about the probability they're kinda misunderstanding assembly theory says nothing about the chemistry because chemistry is chemistry and their constraints are put in by biology there was no chemist in the origin of life bacon unless you believe in the chemist in the sky and they were you know it's like santa claus they had a lot of work to do mhmm but but chemical reactions do not exist in the constraints that allow chemical transformations to occur do exist okay okay so it's constraint so it's there's no chemical reactions it's all constraint application yep which enables the emergence of of what's a different word for chemical reaction transformation transformation yeah like a function it's a function but no but i love chemical reactions as a shorthand and yeah and again so the chemists don't all go mad i mean of course chemical reactions exist on earth a shorthand it's a shorthand for these constraints for for right so assuming all these constraints that we've been using for so long we just assume that that's what was the case yeah in natural language conversation exactly the grammar sort of of chemistry of course emerges in reactions and we can use them reliably but i do not think the wittig reaction is accessible on venus right and that this is useful to remember you know to to to frame it as constraint application is useful for when you zoom out to the bigger picture of the universe and looking at the chemistry of the universe and then starting to apply assembly theory yeah that's interesting that's really interesting but we've also pissed off the chemist now oh i they're they're pretty happy but well most of them no everybody everybody deep down is happy i think they're just sometimes feisty that's how they show that's how they have fun everyone is grumpy on on some days when it when you challenge the problem with this paper is you what is like it's almost like i went to a part it's like you i do used to do this occasionally when i was young go to a meeting and and just find a way to offend everyone at the meeting simultaneously even the even the factions that don't like each other they're all unified in their hatred defending them mhmm this paper it feels like the the person that went to the party and offended everyone simultaneously so stop fighting with themselves and just focus on this paper maybe just a little insider interesting information what were the editors of nyser like what the reviews and so on how difficult was that process because this is a pretty like big paper yeah i mean the so we when we originally sent the paper we sent the paper and the editor said that you know this was like this is a quite a long process we sent the paper and the editor gave us some feedback and said you know i don't think it's that interesting it's not you know or it's hard it's it's a it's a hard concept and we asked and the editor gave us some feedback mhmm and we and and sarah and i took a year to rewrite the paper was the nature of the feedback very specific on like this part this part or was it like like what what are you guys smoking what kind of yeah it was kind of the latter what are you smoking okay and and you know but polite and there's promise yeah well the thing is there was the edit was really critical but in a but in a really professional way yeah and i mean for me this was the way science should happen so when it came back you know we had too many equations in the paper if you look at the preprint they're just equations everywhere like twenty three equations and when i said to abhishek who was the first author we gotta remove all the equations but my assembly equation staying at abhishek was like you know no we can't i said well look if we want to explain this to people it's a real challenge mhmm and so sarah and i went through the i think it was actually a hundred and sixty versions of the paper but we basically we got to version forty or something mhmm we said right zero it start again so we wrote the whole paper again we knew the entire amazing and we just went bit by bit by bit and said what is it we wanna say and then we send the paper in and to our we expected it to be rejected mhmm and not even go to review and then the we got notification back it had gone to review and we were like oh my god it's so gonna get rejected mhmm how is it gonna get rejected because your first assembly paper that on the mass spec we sent to nature got went through six rounds of review and we rejected mhmm right and there's by a chemist who just said i don't believe you you must be committing fraud mhmm and long story probably a boring story but in this case it went out to review the comments came back and the comments were incredibly they they were very they were very deep comments mhmm from all the reviewers there were and but the but the none of the but the nice thing was the reviewers were kind of very critical but not dismissive they were like oh really explain this explain this explain this explain this great are you sure it's not kamala off are you sure it's not this mhmm and we went through i think three rounds of review pretty quick and and the editor went yeah yeah it's in mhmm maybe you could just comment on the whole process you've published some pretty huge papers on all kinds of topics within chemistry and beyond some of them have some little spice in them a little spice of crazy like tom way says i like my tongue with a little drop of poison so there's you know it's not a mundane paper so where what's it like psychologically to go through all this process to keep getting rejected to to get reviews from people that don't get the paper or all that kind of stuff just from a a question of a scientist like what what what is that like it's i think it's i mean this paper for me kind of because this wasn't the the first time we tried to publish assembly theory at the highest level mhmm the nature communications paper we on the mass spec on the on the idea went through went to nature and got rejected well went through six rounds of review and got rejected and and it and it's and i i just was so confused when the when the chemist said this can't be possible i do not believe you can measure complexity using mass spec and also by the way molecules molecules complex molecules can randomly form and we're like but look at the data the data says and they said no no we don't believe you and and we went and we and i just wouldn't give up the edit and the edit in the end was just like the different editors actually right what's behind that never giving up is it like when you're sitting there ten o'clock in the evening there's a melancholy feeling that comes over you and you're like okay this is rejection number five or it's not rejection but maybe it feels like a rejection because the you know the the the comments are that you totally don't get it like what gives you strength to keep going there i don't know i don't normally get emotional about papers but it's not about giving it up because we wanna get it published because we want the glory or anything it's just like why don't you understand and so so what i did so what what i would just is try to be as as as as rational as possible and say yeah you didn't like it tell me why and then sorry give me a sec silly anybody never get emotional about papers normally but but you but i think what we do you just compress like five years of angst from this so it's been it's been rough it's not just rough it's like it happened you know i came up the assembly equation you know remote from sarah in arizona and the people at sfi i felt like i was a mad person like you know the guy in depicted in in a in a beautiful mind who was just like yeah not not the actual genius part but just the yeah just just just the just the crazy part gibberish gibberish yeah because i kept writing expanded and i have no mathematical ability at all and i was expand i was making these mathematical expansions where i kept seeing the same motif again i was like oh i think this is a copy number the same string is coming again and again and again i kept i couldn't do the math mhmm and then i realized the copy number fell out of the equation and everything collapsed down i was like oh that works kind of so we submitted the paper and then when it was almost accepted right the mass spec one and it was astrobiology said great you know a mass spectroscopist said great and the chemist went nonsense like biggest pile of nonsense ever fraud you know and i was like but why fraud and they just said just because and i was like well and so so and there and i could not convince the editor in this case the editor was just so pissed off because they see it as like a kind of a you know a a you're wasting my time and i would not give up i wrote i went and did dissected you know all the parts and i think although i mean i got upset about it you know it was kind of embarrassing actually but but i guess beautiful but it was just trying to understand why they didn't like it so they were part of me was like really devastated and a part of me was super excited because i'm like they can't tell me why i'm wrong and this kinda goes back to you know when i was at school i was in a kind of learning difficulties class and i kept going to the teacher and say you know you know how what do i do today to prove i'm smart and they were like nothing you can't i was like give me a job you know give me something to do mhmm give me a job to do something to to do as we and i kinda felt like that a bit when i was arguing with the not arguing there was no ad homeroom i wasn't telling the editor they were idiots or anything like this or the the reviewers i kept it strictly like factual and all i did is i just kept knocking it down bit by bit by bit by bit by bit it was ultimately rejected and it got published elsewhere and then the actual experimental data so this is kind of in this paper the experimental justification was already published mhmm so when we did this one and we went through the versions and and then we sent it in and in the end it just got accepted we were like well that's kinda cool right this is kinda like you know some days you had you know the the the student sorry the the the first author was like i can't believe it got accepted like nor am i but it's great it's like it's good mhmm and then when the paper was published i was not expecting the backlash i was expecting computational well what no actually i was just expecting one person who'd been trolling me for a while about it just to carry on trolling mhmm but i didn't expect the backlash and then i i wrote i wrote to the editor and apologized and the editor was like what are you apologizing for it was a great paper mhmm of course it's gonna get backlash you said some controversial stuff mhmm but it's awesome and so oh it's i think it's a beautiful story of perseverance and the backlash is just a negative word for discourse which i think is beautiful i think you as i said to you know when it got accepted and people were saying we're kind of like hacking on it and i was like papers are not gold medals mhmm the reason i wanted to publish that paper in nature is because it says hey there's something before biological evolution you have to have that if you're not a creationist by the way mhmm this is an approach first time someone has put a concrete mechanism or sorry a concrete quantification and what comes next you're pushing on is a mechanism mhmm and that's what we need to get to it's an autocallidic set self replicating molecules some other features that come in and the fact that this paper has been so discussed for me is a dream come true like you it doesn't get better than that if you can't accept a few people hating it and the nice thing is the thing that i really makes me happy is that no one has attacked the actual physical content like you you can measure the assembly index you can measure selection now so either that's right or it's well either that's helpful or unhelpful if it's unhelpful this paper will sink down and no one will use it again if it's helpful it'll help people build scaffold on it and will start to converge to a new paradigm so i think that that's the thing that i wanted to see you know my colleagues authors collaborators and people who were like you've just published this paper you're a chemist why have you done this like who are you to be doing evolutionary theory like well i don't know i mean sorry did i need to cause anyone to do anything well i'm glad you did let me just before coming back to origin of life and these kinds of questions you mentioned learning difficulties i didn't know about this so what what was it like i i wasn't very good at school right this is when you were very young yeah yeah well but in primary school i my handwriting was really poor and apparently i couldn't read and and i and my mathematics was very poor so i just said this is a problem they identified it my parents kind of at the time were confused because i was busy taking things apart buying electronic junk from a shop trying to build computers and things and then once i got out of when i was i think about the major transition in my stupidity like you know i everyone thought i wasn't that stupid when i was basically everyone thought i was faking i like stuff and i was faking wanting to be it so i always wanted to be a scientist mhmm so five six seven years old i'd be a scientist take things apart and everyone's like you know this guy wants to be a scientist but he's an idiot mhmm and so and so so everyone was really confused i think at first that i wasn't smarter than i you know was claiming to be and then i just basically didn't do well in the test i went down and down and down and down and then and i was kinda like this is really embarrassing i really like maths and everyone says i can't do it mhmm i really like kind of you know physics and chemistry and all that and science and people say you're not you can't you can't read and write and so i found myself in a learning difficulties class at the end of primary school and the beginning of secondary school in the uk secondary school is like eleven twelve years old mhmm and i remember being put in the in the remedial class and the remedial class was basically full of well two types three types of people there were people that had quite violent right mhmm yeah you know and there were people who couldn't speak english mhmm and there were people that really had learning difficulties so the one thing i can objectively remember was i mean i could read i like reading i read a lot but something in me i was i'm a bit of a rebel i refuse to read what i was told to read and i found it difficult to read individual words in the way they were told but anyway the i got caught one day teaching someone else to read and they said okay we don't understand this i i always know what to be a scientist but i didn't really know what that meant and i realized you had to go to university and i thought i can just go to university it's like curious people i'm like no no no you need to have these you have to be able to enter these exams to get this grade point average and the fact is the exams you've been entered into you're not you you you you're just gonna get c d or e you can't even get a b or c right this is the uk gcses i was like oh shit and i said can you just put me into the the high exams i said no no you're gonna fail there's no chance so my my father kind of intervened and said you know just let him go in the exams just and then they said he's definitely gonna fail it's a waste of time waste of money and he said well what if we paid so they said well okay so you didn't actually have to pay i had to pay if i failed mhmm so i took the exams and passed them unfortunately i didn't get the top grades but i you know i got into a levels but then that also kind of limited what i could do at a levels i wasn't allowed to do a level maths what do you mean you weren't allowed to because i i had such a bad math grade from my gcse i only had a c mhmm but i they wouldn't let me go into the abc for maths because of some kind of coursework requirement back then so the top grade i could've got was a c so c do a e so i got a c and they let me do kind of as level maths which is this half intermediate but and get go to university but in the alkalite chemistry i had a good chemistry teacher so in the end i got to university to do chemistry so through that kind of process i think for kids in that situation it's it's easy to start believing that you're not well how do i put it that you're stupid and basically give up that you're just not good at math you're not good at school so this is by way of advice for people for interesting people for interesting young kids right now experiencing the same thing where was the place what was the source of you not giving up there i have no idea other than i i was really i really like not understanding stuff for me when i not understand something i didn't understand feel like i don't understand anything but but now but back then i was so i remember when i was like i don't know i i tried to build a laser when i was like eight mhmm and i thought how hard could it be like and i basically i was gonna bill i built a c o i was gonna build a c o two laser i was like right i think i need some partially coated mirrors i need some carbon dioxide and i need a high high high high voltage mhmm so i kind of and i was like i didn't have a and i was so stupid right i was kind of so embarrassed i had to make enough c o two i actually set a fire mhmm and try to filter the flame oh nice just to to crack crack enough c o two yeah to and i was like completely completely failed and i bent the half the the garage down mhmm so my parents were not very happy about that but so that was one thing i was like i really like first principle thinking and so you know so i'm i remember being super curious and being determined to find answers and so the the kind of when people do give advice about this why ask for advice about this i don't really have that much advice other than don't give up and one of the things i try to do as a as a chemistry professor in my group is i i don't i hire people that i think that you know i'm kind of who am i if they're persistent enough who am i to deny them the chance because you know people gave me a chance and i was able to do stuff do you believe in yourself essentially i'm i like so i love being around smart people and i love confusing smart people people and when i'm confusing smart people you know not by stealing their wallets and hiding it somewhere but if i can confuse smart people that is is the one piece of hope that i might be doing something interesting oh that's quite brilliant like as a gradient to optimize yeah hang out with smart people and confuse them yeah and the more confusing it is the more there's something there and as long as they're not telling you just a complete idiot and and they give you different reasons yeah and i mean i'm you know if everyone because like with assembly theory and people said oh it's wrong and i was like why and they're like and no one could give me a consistent reason they said oh because it's been done before or it's just comma or it's just there that and the other so i think the the the thing that i like to do is and and in academia it's hard right because people are critical but i mean you know the criticism i mean although i got kind of upset about it earlier which is kind of silly but not silly because obviously it's hard work being on your own or with a team spatially separated like during lockdown and yeah and try to keep everyone on board and and and and be and i have some faith that i've always wanted to have a new idea and so you know i like a new idea and i wanna i don't wanna i wanna nurture it as long as possible and if someone can give me actionable criticism that's why i think i was trying to say earlier when i was kind of like stuck for words give me actionable criticism you know it's wrong okay why is it wrong i say oh it doesn't your your equation's incorrect for this or your method is wrong and and then so if and so what i try and do is get enough criticism from people to then triangulate and go back and i've been very fortunate in my life that i've got great colleagues great collaborators funders mentors and people that will take the time to say you're wrong because and then what i have to do is integrate the wrongness and go oh cool maybe i can fix that and i think criticism is really good people have a go at me because i'm really critical and like but i'm not criticizing you know you as a person i'm just criticizing the idea and trying to make it better and say well what about this and you know and sometimes i'm kind of you know my filters are kind of you know truncated in some ways i'm just like that's wrong that's wrong that's wrong i want to do this and people like oh my god you just told me you destroyed my life's work i'm like relax no i'm just like let's make it better mhmm and i think that we don't do that enough because we're we're you know we we're we're we're either personally critical which isn't helpful or we don't give any criticism at all because we're too scared yeah i yeah the i've i've seen you be pretty aggressively critical but it's every time i've seen it it's the idea not the person i i'm sure i make mistakes on that i mean i i you know i argue i argue lots with with lots i mean i argue lots with sarah and she's like kinda shocked i've argued with yasha in the past and he's like you're just making yascha bach and you're like you're just making that up i'm like no not not quite but kind of yeah you know i had a big argument with sarah about time she's like no time time doesn't exist i'm like no no time does exist and now and as as she realized that her conception of assembly theory and my conception of assembly theory were the same thing necessitated us to abandon the fact that time is eternal to actually really fundamentally question how the universe produces commentary or novelty so so time is fundamental for summary theory so i'm just trying to figure out where you and sarah converge so i i think assembly theory is fine in this time right now but i think it helps us understand that something interesting is going on so there's and i've been really inspired by a a guy called nick gisen i'm gonna butcher his argument but i love his argument a lot so i hope he forgives me if he hears about it but basically if you want free will time has to be fundamental and we can go and if you want time to be fundamental you have to give up on platonic mathematics and you have to use intuition as mathematics by the by the way and again i'm gonna butcher this but basically hilbert said that you know infinite numbers are allowed and i think it was brower said no you can't all numbers are finite so it kind of like we've so let's go back a step because it was like people are gonna say assembly theory seems to explain that large combinatorial space allows you to produce things like life and technology and that large commentarial space is so big it's not even accessible to a sean carroll david deutsch multiverse the physicist saying that that all of all of the universe already exists in time is probably provably that's a strong word not correct that we are gonna know that the universe as it stands the present the way the present builds a future so big the universe can't ever contain the future and this is a really interesting thing i think max tegmark has its mathematical universe where he says you know the universe is kind of like a block universe and i apologize to max if i'm getting it wrong but people think you can just move you'd have the stat you have the initial conditions and you can run the universe right to the end and go backwards and forwards in that universe that is not correct yeah let me load that in the universe is not big enough to contain the future yeah that's why that's it so that that's another that's a beautiful way of saying that time is fundamental yes and the and the the you can have and that's what this is why the the law of the excluded middle something is true or false only works in the past is it gonna snow in new york next week or in austin you might in austin say probably not in new york you might say yeah if you go forward to next week and say did it snow in new york last week true or false you can answer that question the fact that the law of the excluded middle cannot apply to the future explains why time is fundamental well i mean that that that's a good example intuitive example but it's possible that we might be able to predict you know whether it's gonna snow if we had perfect information i i think we you're saying it not impossible impossible so here's why yeah i'll make a quick really quick argument and this argument isn't mine it's it's nick's and and a few other people who have can you can you explain his view on fundamental on time being fundamental yeah so i'll give my view which kind of resonates with his but basically it's very simple actually it would say that free will that your ability to design and do an experiment is exercising free will so he used that thought process but i never really thought about it that way and that you actively make decisions i do think that i used to think that free will was a kind of kind of consequence of just selection but i'm kind of understanding that human free will is something really interesting and he very much inspired me but the thing that what sarah walker said that inspired me as well that that these will converge is that i think that the universe and the universe is very big huge mhmm but actually the own the place that is largest in the universe right now the largest place in the universe is earth yeah i've i've seen you say that and boy does that that's a that's an interesting one to process what do you mean by that earth is the biggest place in the universe because we have this combinatorial scaffolding going all the way back from luca so you've you've got cells that can self replicate and then you go all the way to terraforming the earth you've got all these architectures the amount of selection that's going on biological selection just to be clear biological evolution and then you have multicellularity then animals and abstraction and with abstraction there was another kick because you can then build architectures and computers and cultures and language and these things are the biggest things exist in the universe because we can just build architectures that could naturally arise anywhere and the further that distance goes in time and it there's kind of it's it's just it's gigantic mhmm and from a complexity perspective yeah okay wait a minute but i mean i know you're being poetic but but how do you know there's not other earth like like how do you know you you're basically saying earth is really special it's awesome stuff as far as we look out there's nothing like it going on but how do you know there's not nearly infinite number of places where cool stuff like this is going on i agree and i would say i'll i'll say again that earth is the most gigantic thing we know in the universe commentarily we know we know now yeah now i guess this is just purely a guess i have no data other than hope well maybe not hope maybe no i have some data that every star in the sky mhmm probably has planets yep and life is probably emerging on these planets but this the amount of contingency that has associated with life is that i think the commentarial space associated to these planets is so different we are never gonna our causal cones are never gonna overlap or not easily and this is the thing that makes me sad about alien life why it's why we have to create alien life in the lab as quickly as possible yeah because i don't know if we are gonna be able to be able to build architectures that will intersect with alien intelligence cultures and and intersect you you don't mean in time or space time and the ability to communicate the ability to communicate yeah my biggest fear in a way is that life is everywhere but we become infinitely more lonely because of our scaffolding in that commentarial space because it's so big and because so you're saying the the constraints created by the environment that led to the factory of darwinian evolution are just like this little tiny cone in a nearly infinite combinatorial space exactly other cones like it and and why why you know why can't we communicate with other like just because we can't create it doesn't mean we can't appreciate the creation right like that or decide to detect the creation i i i truly don't know but i it's an excuse for me to ask for people to give me money to make a planet simulator yeah right if i can make with a different a different kind of like another shameless say it's like give me money i need to say this was all a long plug for a planet simulator it's like you know hey i won't be the first in line to do that my my my my rick my rick garage has run out of room you know yeah no and is this is a planet simulator you mean like a different kind of planet yeah well different sets of environments and pressures exactly if we could basically recreate the selection before biology as we know it that gives rise to a different biology we should be able to put the constraints on where to look in the universe so here's the thing here's my here's my dream yeah my dream is that by creating life in the lab and based upon constraints we understand so let's go for venus type life or earth type life or something again do earth two point o screw it let's do earth two point o and earth two point o has a different genetic alphabet fine that's fine different protein alphabet fine have cells and evolution all that stuff we will then be able to say okay life is a more general phenomena selection is more general than than what we think is cons the chemical constraints on life and we can point to james webb and other telescopes at other planets that we are in that zone we are most likely to con combinatorially overlap with mhmm right so because you know we based so there are chemistry you're looking for some overlap and then we can then basically shine light on them literally and white look at light coming back and apply advanced assembly theory to lang general theory of language that we will get and say we in that signal it looks random but there's a copy number oh this random set of things that shouldn't be that that looks like a a true random number generator has structure as a not com not common goloroff ait type structure but evolutionary structure given might be misusing the word cone here i might be misusing the word cone here but the width of the cone is growing faster it's growing really fast to where eventually all the cones overlap i like even in a very very very large combinatorial space it just but then again if you're saying the universe is also growing very quickly in terms of possibilities that's re i hope that as we build as we build abstractions the main i mean one one idea is that as we go to intelligence intelligence allows us to look at the regularities around us in the universe and that gives us some common grounding to to discuss with aliens and and you might be right that that that there we will overlap mhmm there even though we have completely different chemistry literally completely different chemistry that we will be our past information from one another mhmm but it's not a given and you know i have to kind of try and divorce hope and emotion you know away from what i under i can logically justify but it's just hard to intuit a world a universe where there's nearly infinite complexity objects and they somehow can't detect each other but the universe is expanding but the nice thing is that i would say i would look you see i think carl sagan did the wrong well not the wrong thing he he flicked the voyager probe around a pale blue dot mhmm said look how big the universe is i would have done it the other way around and said look at the voyager probe that came from planet earth that came from luca look at how big earth is mhmm that it produced that it produced that yeah and that i think is like completely amazing and then that should allow people on there to think about well probably we should try and get causal chains off earth onto mars mhmm onto the moon wherever whether it's human life or martian life that we create it doesn't matter but but i think this commentarial space tells us something very important about the universe mhmm and and that i realized in assembly theory that the universe is too big con to to contain itself and and i think this is and now coming back and i wanna i want to kind of change your mind about time because i'm i'm guessing that your time is just coordinate yeah so i'm gonna i'm gonna change i'm kept guessing you're one of those yeah gonna change your one of those i'm gonna change your mind in real time or at least attempt oh in real time there you go i already got the tattoo so this is gonna be embarrassing if you change my mind but you can just add you can just add a arrow arrow of time onto it right true just a matter of fact raise it a bit yeah so and the argument that i think that is really most interesting is like people say the initial conditions specify the future of the universe okay fine let's say that's the case for a moment now let's go back to newtonian mechanics mhmm now the uncertainty per principle in in no newtonian mechanics is this if i give you the coordinates of your of an object moving in space and the coordinates of another object and they collide mhmm in space and you know those initial conditions you should know exactly what's gonna happen mhmm however you cannot specify these coordinates to infinite precision now everyone said you know oh this is kind of like you know the chaos theory argument no no it's deeper than that here's a problem with numbers this is how this is where hilbert and brouwer fell out to have the coordinates of this object a given object as it colliding you have to have them to infinite precision that's what hilbert says this is no problem infinite precision is fine let's just take that for granted but when the object is finite and it can't store its own coordinates what do you do mhmm so in principle if a finite object cannot be specified to infinite precision in principle the initial conditions don't apply well how do you know it can't store its well how do you store an infinitely long number in a finite size well we're using infinity very loosely here no no we're using infinite precision i mean not loosely but very precisely think infinite precision is required well let's let's take the object let's say the object is a golf ball mhmm golf ball is a few centimeters in diameter we can work out how many atoms are on the golf ball and let's say we can store numbers down to atomic dislocations mhmm so we can work out how many atoms there are in the golf ball and we can store the coordinates in that golf ball down to that number but beyond that we can't mhmm let's make the golf ball smaller and and this this is where i think that we think that we get randomness in quantum mechanics and some people say you can't get randomness quantum mechanics deterministic but this is where this is where we realize that classical mechanics and quantum mechanics suffer from the same uncertainty principle and that is the inability to specify the the initial conditions to a precise enough degree to give you determinism the universe is intrinsically too big and that's why time exists it's nondeterministic looking back into the past you can look at the you can use logical arguments because you can say was it true or false you already know but this is the fact we are unable to predict the future with the precision is not evidence of lack of knowledge it's evidence the universe is generating new things okay so so to you first of all quantum mechanics you can just say statistically what's gonna happen when two golf balls hit each other statistically but that but but sure i can say statistically what's gonna happen but then when they do happen yeah and then and then you keep nesting it together you can't i mean it goes almost back to look at look at look at let's think about entropy in the universe so how do you what how do we how do we understand entropy change well we could do the look at our process we can use the hypothesis we can also have we can also have the counterfactuals where we have all the different states mhmm and we can even put that in the multiverse right but both those are kind of they they they they're they're nonphysical mhmm the the multiverse kind of collapses back to the same problem about the precision so all the the what you if you accept you don't have to have true and false going forward in the future the real numbers are real they're just they're they're just they're they're observables we're trying to see exactly where time being fundamental sneaks in in this difference between the the the golf ball can't contain its own position perfectly precisely if how that leads to time needing to be fundamental let me i have a quick what do you believe do you believe or do you accept you have free will yeah i think at this moment in time i believe that i have free will so then you are then you have to believe that time is fundamental i i understand that's the statement you've made well no that we can logically follows because if you don't have free will so like if you're in a if you're in a universe that has no time the universe is deterministic if it's deterministic then you have no free will i think the space of how much we don't know is so vast that saying the universe is deterministic and from that jumping there's no free will is just too difficult of a leap no i logically follows no no i'm i don't disagree it's not i'm not saying any i mean it's deep and it's important all i'm all i'm saying and it's the difference of is it actually different to what i've said before mhmm is that if you don't require platonistic mathematics and accepts that that nondeterminism is how the universe looks and that gives us our creativity in the way the universe is getting novelty it's kind of really deeply important in assembly theory because assembly theory starts to actually give you a mechanism where you go from boring time which is basically initial conditions specify everything to a mismatch in creative time and i hope we'll do experiments i think it's really important to i would love to do an experiment to prove that time is fundamental and the universe is generating novelty i don't know all the features of that experiment yet but by you know having these conversations openly and getting people to think about the problems in a new way mhmm mhmm better people more intelligent people with good mathematical backgrounds can say oh hey i've got an idea i would love to do an experiment that that shows that the universe i mean universe is too too big for itself going forward in time and and i really you know this is why i i really hate the idea of the boltzmann brain the boltzmann brain makes me super kind of like you know everyone's having a free lunch it's like saying it's like let's break all the laws of physics so boltzmann brain is this idea that in a long enough universe a brain will just emerge in the universe as conscious mhmm without and that neglects the causal chain of evolution that required to produce that brain and this is where the computational argument really falls down because the computation is because say i can calculate probability of a boltzmann brain mhmm and i can and and they'll give you a probability but i can calculate probability of boltzmann brain zero just because the the the the space of possibility is so large yeah it's like when we start fooling ourselves with numbers that we can't actually measure yeah and we can't ever conceive of i i think it i think it it it it it doesn't give us a good explanation and i've become i want to explain why life is in the universe i think life is actually the novelty minor not i mean life basically mines novelty almost from the future and makes it actualizes it in the present okay life is a novelty minor from the future that is actualized in the present yep i think so novelty minor first of all novelty what's the origin of novelty when you go from boring time to creative time where is that is it as simple as as randomness like you're referring to i i'm really struggling with randomness because i had a really good argument with yascha bach about randomness and he just said randomness doesn't give you free will that's insane because you'd just be random yeah but i think and i think he's right at that level yeah but i don't think we i don't think he is right on another level and it's not about randomness it's about it's about constrained i've got a sound like constrained opportune i'm making this up as i go along so making this up constrained opportunity so what i mean is like so you have to have so the the the novelty what is novelty you know this is why i think is a funny thing you ever wanna discuss ai why i think everyone's kind of gone ai mad is that they're misunderstanding novelty but let's think about novelty yes what is novelty so i think novelty is a genuinely new configuration that is not predicted by the past right and that you discover in the present right and that is truly different right now everyone says that some people say that novelty doesn't exist it's always with precedent i want to do experiments that show that that is not the case and it goes back to a question you asked me a a few moments ago which is where is the factory yeah right because i think the same mechanism that gives us a factory gives us novelty and i think that that is that is why i'm so deeply hung up on time i mean of course i'm wrong but how wrong and i and i think that that life opens up that commentarial space in a way that that that our current laws of physics although as contrived in a deterministic initial condition universe even with the get out of the multiverse david deutsch style which i love by the way mhmm but i don't think is correct but it's it's it's kinda it's it's really beautiful multiverse the david deutsch's conception of the multiverse is kind of like given but i think that the problem with wave particle duality and quantum mechanics is not about the multiverse it's about understanding how determined the past is well i don't think just think that actually this is a a discussion i was having with sarah about that right where she was like oh i think we're we're been debating this for a long time now about how we how do we reconcile novelty determinism indeterminism so so gary just to clarify you both you and sarah think the universe is not deterministic i'm i won't speak for sarah but i roughly i i think that the universe i think the universe is deterministic looking back in the back in the past right but undetermined going going forward in the future so i'm kinda having my cake and eat it eating it here this is because i fundamentally don't understand randomness right as yascha told me or other people told me but if i adopt a new view now which the new view is the universe is just nondeterministic but i'd like to refine that and say the universe appears deterministic going back in the past mhmm but it's but it's undetermined going forward in the future so how can we have a deterministic universe that has deterministic looking rules that's nondetermined going in the future yep it's this breakdown in precision in the initial conditions and we have to just stop using initial conditions and start looking at trajectories and how how the combinatorial space behaves in expanding universe in time and space and assembly theory helps us quantify the the transition to biology biology appears to be a novelty mining because it's making crazy stuff mhmm you know that that we are unique to earth right that that that there are objects on earth that are unique to earth they will not be found anywhere else because you can do the combinatorial math what was that statement you made about life is novelty mining from the future yeah what's the what's what's the little element of time that you're introducing so what i'm kinda meaning is because the future is bigger than the present yeah in a deterministic universe how do you go from the how do how do the how do the states go from one to another i mean there's a mismatch right yeah so so that must mean that you have a little bit of indeterminism whether that's randomness or something else i don't understand i want to do experiments to formulate a theory to refine that as we go forward that might help us explain that and and i think it's why i'm so determined to try and crack the the nonlife to life transition looking at networks and molecules and that might help us think about it the the mechanism but certainly the future is bigger than the past in in my conception of the universe in some conception of the universe and by the way that's not obvious right that's what we was just kinda the future being bigger than the past well that that's one statement and the statement that the universe is not big enough to contain the future is another statement yeah yeah yeah yeah i that one is a big one i i'm that one's a really big one i think so i think it but i think it's entirely because look we have the second law mhmm and right now i mean i'm we don't need the second law if the future's bigger than the past it follows naturally right so why are we retrofitting all these these sticking plasters onto our reality to hold on to a timeless universe yeah but that's because it's kind of difficult to imagine the universe that's that can't contain the future but it's not really exciting it's very exciting but it's it's hard i mean we're we're humans on earth and we have a very kinda four dimensional conception of the world of mhmm three d plus time it's just hard to intuit a world where what does that even mean a universe that can't contain the future yeah it's kind of it's kinda crazy but obvious weird i mean i i suppose it sounds obvious yeah if it's true but the nice thing is you can so what i i mean the so the reason why assembly theory turned me onto that was that you let's let's just start in the present and look at all the complex molecules and go backwards in time mhmm and understand how evolutionary processes go gave rise to them it's not into it's not at all obvious that taxol which is a complex one of the most complex natural products produced by biology was gonna be invented by biology it's an accident you know taxol is unique to earth there's no taxol elsewhere in the universe and taxol was not decided by the initial conditions it was decided by this kind of the this interplay between the so the past simply is embedded in the present it gives some features but why the past doesn't map to the future one to one is because the universe is too big to contain itself that gives space for creativity novelty and and on some things which are unpredictable well okay so given that you're disrespecting the power of the initial conditions let me ask you about so how do you explain that cellular automata are able to produce such incredible complexity given just basic rules and basic initial conditions i think that that you've you've this falls into the brouwer hilbert trap mhmm so how do you get a cellular automata producing complexity you have a computer you generate a display and you map the change of that in time mhmm there are some cas repeat like functions like it's fascinating to me that for pi there is a there is a formula where you can go to the the millionth decimal place of pi mhmm and read out the the the number without having to go there mhmm but there are some numbers where you can't do that you have to just crank through mhmm there's whether it's wolframian computational irreducibility or some other thing well it doesn't matter but these cas that complexity is that just complexity or a number that is basically you're mining that number in time mhmm you know is that just a display screen for that number that function well can't you say the same thing about the complexity on earth then no because the complexity on earth has a copy number and an assembly index associated with it that ca is just a number running you don't think it has a copy number wait wait a minute well it it does in the human where where we're looking at humans producing different rules but then it's nested on selection so those cas are produced by selection yeah i mean the ca is such a a fascinating pseudo complexity generator what i would love to do is understand quantify the degree of surprise in the ca and run it long enough mhmm but what that i guess that means is we have to instantiate we have to have a number of experiments where we're generating different rules and running them time step steps but oh got it cas are mining novelty mhmm in the few from the you know in the future by iteration right and you're like oh that's great that's great you didn't predict it some rules you can predict the the what's gonna happen other rules you can't so for me if anything cas are evidence that the the universe is too big to contain itself because otherwise you'd know what the rules are gonna do forever more right i guess you were saying that the physicist saying that all you need is the initial conditions and the rules of physics is somehow missing the bigger picture yeah and you know if you look at ca's all you need is the initial condition and and the rules and then run the thing you need three things you need the initial conditions you need the rules and you need time iteration to mine it out without the coordinate you can't get it out sure and that's that that to you is fundamental and you can't predict it from initial conditions yeah if you could then to be fine and that time is a resource foundation of this is the history the memory of each of the things that created it has to have that memory of all the things that led up to it i think it's a yeah you have to have the resource yeah because time is a fundamental resource and and yeah i'm becoming i think i had a major epiphany about randomness but i keep doing that every two days and then it goes away again it's random you're you're a time fundamentalist you should be as well if you believe in free will yeah the only conclusion is there is time is fundamental otherwise you cannot have free will it logically follows well my my the foundation of my belief in free will is just is is observation driven but that's i think if you use logic it's like logically it seems like the universe is deterministic looking backwards in time and that's correct universe is and then everything else is is a is a is a kind of leap it requires a leap i mean i i i think that it's kind of this is what i think machine learning is gonna provide a big a chunk of that right because it it it'll help us explain this so the way i'd say if you take that's interesting why well let's let's let's just my favorite one one is because i'm i'm the ai doomers are driving me mad and ai in fact we don't have any intelligence yet i call ai autonomous informatics just to make people grumpy yeah and they could you're saying we're quite far away from agi i think that we have no conception of intelligence and i think that we don't understand how the human brain does what it does i think that we are neuroscience is making great advances but i think that we have no idea about agi so i am a technological i guess optimist i believe we should do everything the whole regulation of ai is nonsensical i mean why would you regulate excel other than the fact that clippy should come back and i love excel ninety seven because we can play you know we can do the flight flight simulator i'm sorry in excel yeah have you not played the flight simulator in nineteen ninety seven yeah what does that look like it's like wireframe very very basic but basically i think it's x zero y zero shift and it opens up and you can play the fight simulator oh wow wait wait is it using excel excel excel ninety seven okay i resurrected it the other day and saw clippy again for the first time in a long time well clippy is definitely coming back but you're saying we don't have a a great understanding of what is intelligence what is the intelligence i am very frustrated on underpinning the human mind i'm very frustrated by the way that we're ai dooming right now and people were bestowing some kind of magic mhmm now let's go back a bit so you said agi are we far away from agi yes i do not think we're gonna get to agi anytime soon i've seen no evidence of it and the ai doom scenario is nonsensical and extreme yeah and the reason why i think it's nonsensical but it's not non i don't think there isn't things we should do and be very worried about right i mean there are things we would need to worry about right now what ai doing whether it's fake data fake users right i want authentic people or authentic data i don't want everything to be faked and i think it's a really big problem and i absolutely wanna go on the record to say i really worry about that what i'm not worried about is that some fictitious entity is going to turn us all to paperclips or detonate nuclear bombs i don't know maybe i don't know anything you can't think of why is this is a and i'll i'll take a very simple series of logical arguments and and this is the the the the ai doomers are have not had the correct and this is had not had the correct they do not have the correct epistemiology they do not understand what knowledge is and until we understand what knowledge is they're not gonna get anywhere because they're applying things falsely so let me give you a a very simple argument people talk about the probability pdoom ai i can we can work out the probability of a asteroid hitting the planet why because it's happened before we know the mechanism we know that there's a gravity well or that you know space time is bent and stuff falls in we don't know the probability of agi because we have no mechanism so let me give you the another one which is like i'm really worried about ag what's ag ag is anti gravity one day we could wake up in anti gravity you know is discovered we're all gonna die the atmosphere is gonna float away we're gonna float away we're all doomed what is the probability of ag we don't know because there's no mechanism for ag do we worry about it no and i don't understand the current reason for the for the for certain people in certain areas to be generating this nonsense mhmm i think they're not doing it maliciously i think we're observing the emergence of new religions how religions come because religions are about kind of some controls so you got the optimist saying ai is gonna cure us all and ai is gonna kill us all what's the reality well we don't have ai we have really powerful machine learning tools and they will allow us to do interesting things and we need to be careful about how we use those tools in terms of manipulating human beings and faking stuff right right well let me let me try to sort of steal man the ai doomers argument actually i don't know are ai doomers in the yarkovsky camp saying it's definitely gonna kill us because there's a spectrum ninety five percent i think is the limit yeah ninety five percent plus that's no not not plus i think i don't know i was seeing on twitter today various things but i think yudakowski is at yudakowski is at ninety five percent but to belong to the ai drummer club is there a threshold i don't know what the membership is may may maybe it's and what are the fees i think well i saw i think scott aronson like i was quite surprised had put two i i saw this online so it could be wrong so sorry if it's wrong says two percent but the thing is if you were to go if you if someone said there's a two percent chance you're gonna die going into the lift would you go into the lift in the elevator for the yeah yeah elevator american english speaking audience well no not for the elevator so i would say anyone higher than two percent i mean like i i mean i think there's a zero percent chance of agi doom zero just to push back on the on the argument where the n of zero on the agi we could see on earth that there is increasing levels of intelligence of organisms we could see what humans with extra intelligence were able to do to the other species so that is a lot of samples of data what a delta in intelligence gives you when you have an increase in intelligence how you're able to dominate a species on earth and so the idea there is that if you have a a being that's ten x smarter than humans we're not gonna be able to predict what that's going to mhmm what that being is gonna be able to do especially if it has the power to hurt humans which you can imagine a lot of trajectories in which the more benefit ai systems give the more control we give to those ai systems over our power grid over our nuclear weapons or weapons of any sort and then it's hard to know what a ultra intelligence system would be able to do in that case you you don't find that convincing i think this is a i would i would fail that argument one hundred percent here's a number of reasons to fail it on first of all we don't know where the intention comes from the problem is that people think they keep you know we caught i've been watching all the hucksters online with the prompt engineering and all this stuff where when i talk to a typical ai computer scientist they keep talking about the ai as having some kind of decision making ability that is a category error the decision making ability comes from human beings we have no understanding of how humans make decision we've just been discussing free will for the last half an hour right we don't even know what that is so the intention i totally agree with you people who intend to do bad things can do bad things and we should not let that risk go that's totally here and now mhmm i do not want that to happen and i'm happy to be regulated to make sure that systems i generate whether they're like computer systems or you know i'm working on a new project called x called chem machina nice well done yeah yeah which is basically a for people who don't understand the point the ex machina is a great film about i guess agi embodied and chemistry chemistry version of that and i only know one way to embody intelligence that's in chemistry and human brains mhmm so category error number one is agents they have agency category error number two is saying that assuming that anything we make is gonna be more intelligent now you didn't say super intelligent i'll put the words into our mouths here super intelligent sure that i think that there is no no reason to expect that we are gonna make systems that are more intelligent more capable you know when people play chess computers they don't expect to win now right they just the chess computer could he's very good at chess mhmm that doesn't mean it's super intelligent so i think that super intelligence i mean i think even nick bostrom is is pulling back on this now because he invented this so i see this a lot when did the first happen eric drexler nanotechnology atomically precise machines he came up with a world where we had these atom cogs everywhere they were gonna we're gonna make self replicating nanobots not possible why because there's no resources to build these self replicating nanobots mhmm you can't get the precision it doesn't work it was a major category error in taking engineering principles down to the molecular level the only functioning molecular technology we know sorry the only functioning nanomolecular technology we know produced by evolution there mhmm so let's go forward to agi what is agi we don't know it's super it can do this or can humans can't think that i would argue the only agis that exist in the universe are produced by evolution and sure we may be able to make our working memory better we might be be able to do more things the human brain is the most compact computing unit in the universe uses twenty watts is a uses a really limited volume it's not like a chat gpt cluster which has to have thousands of watts model that's generated and has to be corrected by human beings you are autonomous and embodied intelligence so i think that there are so many levels that we're missing out we've just kind of went oh we've discovered fire oh gosh the planet's just gonna burn one day randomly mhmm i mean i just don't understand that leap there are bigger problems we need to worry about so what is the motivation why are these people let's assume they have their earnest have this conviction mhmm well i think it's just it's kind of they're making leaps that that they're trapped in a virtual reality that isn't reality well i mean i can continue a set of arguments here but also it is true that ideologies that fear monger are dangerous because you can then use it to control to to regulate in a way that halts progress to control people to to cancel people all that kind of stuff so you have to be careful because you you reason ultimately wins right but there there is a lot of concerns with superintelligence systems with very capable systems when you i think when i when you hear the word superintelligent you're hearing like it's smarter than humans in every way that humans are smart but the paperclip manufacturing system doesn't need to be smart in every way it just needs to be smart in a set of specific ways and the more capable the ai systems become the more you could see us giving them control over like i said our power grid a lot of aspects of human life and then that means they will be able to do more and more damage when there's unintended consequences that come to life i i think that that's right the unintended consequences we have to think about and i'm that i fully i fully agree with but let's go back a bit sentient i mean again i'm far away from my comfort zone and all this stuff but hey let's talk about it because well i i i give myself a qualification yeah we're both qualified in sentience i think yeah so as as much as anyone else i think the paperclip scenario is just such a poor one because let's think about how that would happen and also let's think about we are being so unrealistic about how much of the earth's surface we have commandeered mhmm alright you know for paper mitt clip manufacturing to really happen i mean do the math it's like it's it's not gonna happen there's not enough energy there's not enough resource where are they all gonna come from i think that what happens in evolution is really why is why is a killer virus not killed out all of not killed all life on earth what happens is sure super killer viruses that kill the ribosome have emerged but you know what happens they nuke a small space because they can't propagate they all die so there's this interplay between evolution and propagation right and death and so in evolution in you don't think it's possible to engineer for example sorry to interrupt but like a perfect virus no that's deadly enough no pretty nonsensical okay i think that just wouldn't again it wouldn't work so it's too deadly it would just kill the radius and not replicate it yeah i mean wait you don't think it's possible to get a you i mean if you were soup i mean i if you were it not kill all of life on earth but kill all humans there's not many of us there's only like eight billion there's there's so much more ants i mean i don't i so many more ants and they're pretty smart i think we the nice thing about what we're where we are i would love for the ai crowd to take a leaf out of the book of the bio warfare chemical warfare crowd mhmm i mean not love because actually people have been killed with chemical weapons in the first and second world war and people and bioweapons have been made and you know we can argue about covid nineteen and all this stuff let's not go there just now but i think there is a consensus that some certain things are bad and we shouldn't do them right and and sure it would be possible for a bad actor to to engineer something bad but the the damage would be we would see it coming and we would be able to do something about it now i i guess what i'm trying to say is when people talk about doom and they just when you ask them for the mechanism they just say you know they just make something up i'm i mean in this case i'm with yan lagoon i think you put out a very good point about trying to regulate jet engines before we've even invented them yeah and i think that's what i'm saying i'm not saying we should i just don't understand why these guys are going around making literally making stuff up about us all dying yeah when basically we need to actually really focus on now let's say there's some actors that are earnest mhmm right let's say jadowski is being earnest right and he really cares but then but he loves it he goes and then you're all gonna die it's like you know why don't we try and do the same thing and say you could do this and then you're gonna be happy forever after yeah can you hear me well i i think there's several things to say there one i think there is a role in society for people that say we're all gonna die because i think it filters through as a message as a viral message that gives us the proper amount of concern so alright meaning not the it's not ninety five percent but when you say ninety five percent and it filters through society it'll give an average of like a point zero three percent an average so it's nice to have people that are like we're all gonna die then we'll have a proper concern like for example i do believe we're not properly concerned about the threat of nuclear weapons currently like that that it just seems like people have forgotten that that's a thing and you know there's a war in ukraine with the nuclear power involved there's nuclear power throughout the world and it just feels like we're on the brink of a potential world war to a percentage that i don't think people are properly calibrating like in their head we're all thinking it's a twitter battle as opposed to like actual threat so like it's nice to have that kind of level of concern but to me like what i when i hear ai doomers what i'm imagining is with an unintended consequences a potential situation where let's say five percent of the world suffers deeply because of a mistake made of unintended consequences i don't imagine the entire human civilization dying but there's could be a lot of suffering if this is done poorly i understand that and i'm i kind of i guess i mean i'm involved in the whole hype cycle like why what i would like us to i don't want us to so what's happening right now is there seems to be so let me let's say having some people saying ai ai doom is a worry mhmm fine let's give them that but it what seems to be happening is there seems to be people who don't think ai is doing they're trying to use that to control regulation and to push people to regulate where which which stops humans generating knowledge yep and i am an advocate for generating as much knowledge as possible mhmm when it comes to nuclear weapons i grew up in the seventies and eighties where the with nuclear doom every or a lot of adults really had existential threat almost as bad as now with ai doom they were really worried right there were some great well not great there were some horrific documentaries i think there's one called freds that was generated in the uk which it was like it was terrible it was like so scary and i think that the correct thing to do is obviously get rid of nuclear weapons but let's think about unintended consequences we've got rid of this is common this is such a nonsecret we got rid of all the sulfur particles in the atmosphere right or the or the soot mhmm and what's happened in the last couple of years is global warming has accelerated because we've cleaned up the atmosphere too much so sure i mean the same thing if you get rid of nuclear weapons you can i exactly that's my point it's if if so what we could do is if we actually started to put the ai in charge which is i really like an ai to be in charge of all world politics and this just sounds ridiculous for a second hang on but if we could all agree on the the ad rumors just woke up yeah yeah yeah in that statement but i really don't like politicians who are basically just looking at local sampling but if you could say globally look here's some game theory here there's how what is the minimum number of nuclear weapons we need to distribute around the night the world to everybody to basically reduce war to zero i mean just the start experiment of the united states and china and russia and major nuclear powers get together and say alright we're gonna distribute nuclear weapons to everybody every single nation on earth yep oh boy i mean that has a probably greater than fifty percent chance of eliminating major military conflict yeah yeah but it's not a hundred percent but it but i don't think anyone will use them because i think i think and look what you've gotta try and do is like for to qualify for these nuclear weapons this is a great idea the game theorist should do this right uh-huh i think the question is this i i really buy your question we have too many nukes from just from a feeling point of view that we've got too many of them so let's reduce the number but not get rid of them because we'll have too much conventional warfare so then what is the minimum number of nuclear weapons we can just shoot around to to remove what humans hurting each other is something we should stop doing it's in it's not out with our our conceptual capability but right now what about nations certain nations that are being exploited for their natural resources in the future because for a short term gain because we don't wanna generate knowledge and and so if everybody had an equal doomsday switch mhmm i i predict the quality of life of the average human will go up faster i am an optimist and i believe that humanity is gonna get better and better and better that we're gonna eliminate more problems but i think yeah that's the but the probability of a bad actor of one of the nations setting off a nuclear weapon i mean you have to you have to integrate that into the but we we get we just give you the nuke nuke's like population right we give what we do is we but anyway let's just just go there let's say we so if a if a small nation with a couple of nukes uses one because they're a bit bored or annoyed they're gonna they the likelihood that they are gonna be pummeled out of existence immediately is one hundred percent mhmm and yet they've only they've only nuked one other city i know this is crazy and i apologize for well no no i think this just to be clear we're just having a thought experiment that's interesting but you know there's terrorist organizations that would take that would take would take that trade yeah i feel like i'm i'm we have to ask ourselves a question of how many which percentage of humans would be suicide bombers essentially to to because they hate another group of people and that i believe it's a very small fraction but is it large enough to if you give out nuclear weapons i can predict a future where we take all nuclear material and we burn it for energy right as we're because we're getting there and the other thing you could do is say look there's a gap so if we get all the countries to sign up to the virtual nuclear agreement where we all exist we have a simulation yeah where we can nuke each other in the simulation and the and the economic consequences are catastrophic sure in the simulation i love it it's not gonna kill all humans it's just going to have economic consequences yeah yeah i don't know i just made it up it seems like it's all interesting i mean it's but it's interesting whether that would have as much power in human psychology as actual physical nuclear i think so it's possible but people don't take economic consequences as seriously i think as actual nuclear weapons i think they do in argentina and they do in somalia and they do in a lot of these places where no i i think this is a great idea i'm a strong advocate now for so what have we come up with burning burning all the nuclear material to have energy mhmm and before we do that because mad is good mutually assured destruction is very powerful let's take it into the metaverse mhmm and then get people to kind of subscribe to that and if they actually nuke each other even for fun in the metaverse there are dire consequences yeah yeah so it's like a video game we all have to join this metaverse video game yeah i can't believe it's dire economic consequences i don't know how and it's all run by ai as you mentioned which so the ai doomers is are really terrified at this point they're they're happy to have a job for another twenty years right oh okay fearmongering yeah yeah yeah we got i'm a believer in equal employment you've mentioned that what you call it chem machina yep yeah so you've mentioned that a a chemical brain is something you're interested in creating and that's a way to get conscious ai soon can you explain what a chemical brain is i wanna understand the mechanism of intelligence that's gone through evolution right because the way that the way that intelligence was produced by evolution appears to be the following origin of life multicellularity locomotion sensors once you can start to see things come coming towards you and you can remember the past and interrogate the present and imagine the future you can do something amazing right so and i think only in recent years did humans become turing complete right yeah uh-huh yeah right and we'll go and so that turing completeness kinda gave us another kick up but our ability to process that information is produced in a wet brain and and i think that we are not getting we do not have the correct hardware architectures to have the domain flexibility and the the ability to integrate information i think intelligence also comes at a massive compromise of data right now we're obsessing about getting more and more data more and more processing more and more tricks to get dopamine hits so we're gonna when we look back on this going oh yeah that was really cool because when i've chat i've chat gpt it made me it made me really feel really happy mhmm i got a hit from it but actually it just exposed how little intelligence i use in it in every moment because i'm easily fooled so what i would like to do is to say well hey hang on what is it about the brain so the brain has this incredible connectivity and it has the ability to you know as i said earlier about my nephew you know i just i went from bill to billie and he went hello leroy like how did he make that leap that he was able to basically without any training i extended his name he went gay and he doesn't like he wants to be called bill mhmm he went back and said you like to be called lee i'm gonna call you leroy so human beings have a brilliant ability or intelligent beings appear to have a brilliant ability to integrate across all domains all at once and to synthesize something which allows us to generate knowledge and and becoming true and complete on our own i don't although ais are built in turing complete things their their thinking is not turing complete mhmm and that they are not able to build universal explanations and that lack of universal explanation means that they're just inductivists inductivism doesn't get you anywhere and not not it's just basically a party trick mhmm it's like you know the the the i like the i think it's in the fabric of reality from david deutsch where basically you know it it it the farmer is feeding the chicken every day and the chicken's getting fat and happy and the chicken's like i'm really happy every time the farmer comes in and feeds me and then one day the farmer comes in and doesn't instead of feeding the chicken just rings its neck you know and that's kind of and had the chicken had an alternative understanding of why the farmer was feeding it mhmm it's interesting though because we all know what's special about the human mind that's able to come up with these kind of generalities these universal theories of things so that's and we'll come up with novelty i can imagine because you gave an example you know you know about william and leroy i i feel like example like that will be able to see in future versions of large language models we'll be really really really impressed by the humor the insights all of it because it's fundamentally trained on all the incredible humor and insights that's available out there on the internet right so we'll be impressed i think we'll be impressed oh i'm impressed right i am impressed increasingly so but we're mining the past yes and what the human brain appears to be able to do is mine the future yes so novelty it it is interesting whether these large language models will ever be able to come up with something truly novel i can show on the back of a piece of paper why that's impossible and it's like the problem is that and again these are domain experts kind of bullshitting each other mhmm the term generative yes right average person they are it's no no no if look if i take the the numbers between zero and one thousand and i train a model to pick out the prime numbers by giving them all the prime numbers between zero and a thousand it doesn't know what prime number is mhmm occasionally if i can cheat a bit it will start to guess the the it never will produce anything out with the dataset because you mind the past the thing that i'm getting to is i think that actually current machine learning technologies might actually help reveal why time is fundamental it's like kind of insane because they tell you about what's happened in the past but they can never help you understand what's happening in the future without training examples sure if that thing happens again it's like so i think so let's think about what large language models are doing we have the we have the lang we have all the internet as we know it you know language but also they're doing something else we're having human beings correcting it all the time those models are being corrected steered corrected modified tweaked it's well yeah but i mean cheating well you could say that training on human data in the first place is cheating well let me the human is in the loop sorry to interrupt yes so human is definitely in the loop but it's not just human is in the loop a very large collection of humans is in the loop look i tell you could be i mean to me it's not intuitive that you said prime numbers that the system can't generate an algorithm right that the algorithm that can generate prime numbers or the algorithm that can tell you if a number is prime and so on and generate algorithms that generate algorithms that generate algorithms that i i can check start to look a lot like human reasoning you know i don't think i think again we can show that on a piece of paper that sure i think there has you have to have so this is the failure in epidemiology like i'm i'm glad i even could say that word then and what it means right i said it multiple times i know it's like three times now without failure quit while you're ahead just don't say it again because you did really well thanks so i but i i think the so what is reasoning so coming back to the chemical brain if i could basically if i could show that in a because i mean i'm never gonna make an intelligence in in kam mackinar because we don't have brain cells they don't have glial cells they don't have neurons but if i can make if i can take a matri a gel and engineer the gel to have be a hybrid hardware for reprogramming which i think i know how to do i will be able to process a lot more information and train that they train models billions of times cheaper and use cross domain knowledge and there are certain techniques i think we can do but they're still missing though the the abilities of human beings have had to become true and complete and so i guess the question to to give back at you and i is like how do you tell the difference between trial and error and the generation of new knowledge i think the way you can do it is this is that you come up with a a theory an explanation inspiration comes from out yeah and then you then test that and then you you see that's going towards the truth and human beings are very good at doing that in and the transition between philosophy mathematics physics and natural sciences where and i think that we we can see that where i get confused is why people misappropriate the term artificial intelligence to say hey there's something else going on here because i think you and i both agree machine learning is really good it's only gonna get better we're gonna get happier with the outcome but why would you ever think the model was thinking or reasoning reasoning requires intention and the intention if the model isn't reasoning the intentions come from the prompter and the intention has come from the person who programmed it to do it so i i but don't you think you can prompt it to have intention basically start with the initial conditions and get it going where the you know currently large language models jad gpt only talks to you when you talk to it there's no reason why you can't just start it talking but with but those initial condition conditions came from someone starting it yes and that causal chain in there so that intention comes from the outside i think that there is something in that causal chain of intention that's super important mhmm i i don't disagree we're gonna get to agi it's a matter of when and what hardware i i think we're not gonna do it in this hardware and i think we're unnecessarily fetishizing really cool outputs and dopamine hits because obviously that's what people wanna sell us well but there could be i mean agi is a is a loaded term but there could be incredibly super impressive intelligent systems on the way to agi so these large language models i mean if it appears conscious if it appears super intelligent poor way to say it's not i agree but i the superintelligence i want i want to i want to be able to have a discussion with it about coming up with fundamental new ideas that generate knowledge and if this if the superintelligence we generate can mind novel even in the future that i didn't see in its training set in the past i would agree that something really interesting is coming on i'll say that again if the if the intelligent system be it a human being a chat chatbot something else is able to produce something truly novel that we i could not predict even having full audit trail from the past then i'd be sold well so we should be clear that it can currently it can currently produce things that are in a shallow sense novel that are not in the training set but you're saying truly novel i think they are in the training set i think everything it produces comes from a training set they might be inter there's a difference between interpret novelty and interpolation mhmm we do not understand where these leaps come from yet that is what intelligence is i would argue those leaps and some people say no it's actually just what will happen if you just do cross domain training and all that stuff and that may be true and i may be completely wrong but right now the human mind is able to mine novelty in a way that artificial intelligence systems cannot and this is why we still have a job and we're still doing stuff and you know i use chat g p t for a few weeks oh this is cool and then it took me too i had to i well what happened is it took me too much time to correct it then it got really good and now they've they've done something to it it's not actually that good yeah right i don't know what's going on censorship yeah and so i mean that's interesting but it will push us humans to characterize novelty better like characterize the the the novel like what is novel what is truly novel what's the difference between novelty and interpolation i think that this this is the thing that makes me most excited about these technologies is they're gonna help me demonstrate to you that time is fundamental and unit future is bigger than the than the than the the present which is why we we are human beings are quite good at generating novelty because we have to expand our dataset and and to cope with unexpected things in our environment our environment froze them all at us again we have to survive in that environment and i mean i look i i never say never i would be very interested in how we can get cross domain training cheaply in chemical systems because i'm a chemist and bray the only sent in thing i know of is a human brain but maybe that's just me being boring and predictable and not novel yeah you mentioned gpt for electron density so a gpt like system for generating molecules that can bind to host automatically i mean that's that's interesting that's really interesting applying this same kind of transform mechanism yeah for i mean this is one that it goes my team i try and do things that are non obvious but non obvious in certain areas and one of the things i was always asking about in chemistry people like to represent molecules as graphs mhmm and it's quite difficult it's it's really hard in a if you're doing ai and chemistry you really want to basically have good representations you can generate new molecules they're interesting and i was thinking well molecules aren't really graphs and they're not continuously differentiable could i do something that was continuously differentiable i was like well molecules are actually made of electron density mhmm so then i got thinking and say well okay could there be a way where we could just basically take a take a database of readily solved electron densities for millions of molecules so we took electron density for millions of molecules and just train the model to put to learn what electron density is and so what we built was a system that you literally could give it a let's say you could take a protein that has a particular active site or you know a cup with a certain hole in it you pour noise into it and with the gpt you turn the noise into electron density and then in this case it hallucinates like all of them do but the hallucinations are good because it means i don't have to train on such a large num such a huge dataset because these datasets are very expensive because how do you produce it so so go back a step so you've got all these molecules in this dataset but what you've literally done is a a quantum mechanical calculation where you molecule mhmm so you say oh this representation of this molecule has these electron density associated with it so you know what the representation is and you train the neural network to know what electron density is so then you give it an unknown pocket you pour in noise and you say right produce me electron density it produces electron density that doesn't look ridiculous and what we we did in this case is we produce electron density that maximizes the electrostatic potential so the stickiness but minimizes the what we call the steric hindrance so the overlap that's repulsive so you know make the perfect fit and then we then use the kind of a a trend kind of like a chat gpt type thing to turn that later on density into what's called a smile a smile string is a is a is a a a way of representing a molecule in letters mhmm and then we can then so it just generates them just generates them and then the other thing is then we bung that into the computer and then it just makes it yeah the the computer being the thing that get you right the the robot that we've got that can basically just do chemistry yeah so kind of we've kind of got this end to end drug discovery machine where you can say oh you wanna bind to this active site here you go i mean it's a bit leaky and things kinda break but it's the it's the proof of principle but were the hallucinations what are those still accurate well the hallucinations are really great in this case because in the case of a large language model the hallucinations just like just make everything up to when it doesn't just make everything up but it gives you an output that you're plausibly comfortable with it thinks you're doing probabilistically the problem on these ertron density models is it's very expensive to solve a schrodinger equation going up to many heavy atoms and and large molecules and so we wondered if we trained the the the system on up to nine heavy atoms whether it would go beyond nine and it did it started to generate molecules of twelve no problem they look pretty good and i was like well this hallucination i will take for free thank you very much because it just basically this is a case where interpolation extrapolation worked relatively well and we were able to generate the really good molecules and then what we were able to do here is and this is a really good point what i was trying to say earlier that we were able to generate new molecules from the known dataset that would bind to the the host so a new guest would bind were these truly novel not really because they they they were constrained by the host were they new to us yes so i do under well understand i can concede that machine learning systems artificial intelligence systems can generate new entities but how novel are they it remains to be seen yeah and how novel the things that humans generate is also difficult to quantify mhmm they seem novel that's what a lot of people say like you know so the way to really get to genuine novelty and assembly theory shows you the way is to have different causal chains overlap and this the reading is and it really resonates with the the the time is fundamental argument and if you're bringing together a couple of object objects with different initial conditions coming together when they interact the more different their histories the more novelty they generate in time going forward and so it could be that genuine novelty is basically about mix mix it up a little mhmm and the human brain is able to mix it up a little little and all that stimulus comes from the environment but all i think i'm saying is the universe is deterministic going back in time nondeterministic going forward in time because the future is too the universe is too big in the future to contain in the present therefore these collisions of known things generate unknown things that then become part of your dataset and don't appear weird that's how we give ourselves comfort the past looks consistent with this initial condition hypothesis but actually we're generating more and more novelty mhmm and that's how it works simple so it's hard to quantify a novelty looking backwards i mean the novel the the the present and the future are the novelty generators but i i like this whole idea of mining novelty i think it is it is gonna reveal why the the limitations of current ai is a bit like a printing press right everyone thought that when book when the printing press came that writing books is gonna be terrible that you had evil spirits and all this they were just books and same would be with ai yeah but there there i think they're just the scale you can achieve in terms of impact with ai systems is pretty nerve wracking but that's what the big companies want you to think but not like in terms of destroy all humans but you can have major consequences in the way social media has had major consequences both positive and negative and so you have to kinda think about it and worry about it but yeah people that fearmonger you know my pet theory yeah for this you wanna know yeah is i think that a lot of and maybe i'm being and i think i really do respect you know a lot of the people out there who are trying to have discourse about the positive future so openai guys meta guys and all this what i wonder if they're trying to cover up for the fact that social media has had a pretty disastrous effect at some level yeah and they're just trying to say oh yeah we should do this because and and covering up for the fact that we have got some problems with you know teenagers and instagram and snapchat and you know all this stuff and maybe they're just overreacting now yeah it's like oh yeah sorry we made the bubonic plate and gave it to you all and you're all dying and now yeah but look at this over here it's even worse yeah there's a there's a little bit of that but there's also not enough celebration of the positive impact that all these technologies have had we tend to focus on the negative and tend to forget that in part because it's hard to measure like it's very hard to measure the positive impact social media had on the world yeah i i agree but if what i worry about right now is like i'm really i do care about the ethics of what we're doing and one of the reasons why i'm so open about the the things we're trying to do in the lab make life look at intelligence all this is so people say what are the consequences of this yeah and you say what are the consequences of not doing it and i think that what i what worries me right now in the present is lack of authenticated users mhmm and authenticated data and and human users yeah human i still think that there will be ai agents that appear to be conscious but they would have to be also authenticated and labeled as such oh so there's too much there's too much value in that you know like friendships with ai systems there's too much meaningful human experiences to have with ai systems that i just but that's like a tool right it's a bit like a meditation tool right some people have a meditation tool it makes them feel better but i'm not sure you can ascribe sentience and legal rights to a chatbot that makes you feel less lonely sentience yes i think legal rights no i i think it's the same you can have a really deep meaningful relationship with a dog and was the dog sentient yes the chatbot's not not right now using the technology we use it's not gonna be sentient this is gonna be a fun continued conversation on twitter that i look forward to since you've had also from another place some debates that were inspired by the assembly theory paper let me ask you about god is there any room for notions of god in assembly theory of god yeah i i don't know what god is a i mean so god exists in our minds created by selection so human beings have created the concept of god in the same way that human beings have created the concept of superintelligence sure but does it does it mean does it not it still could mean that that's a projection from the real world where like we're just assigning words and concepts to a thing that is fundamental to the real world that there is something out there that is a creative force underlying the universe i think the universe there is a creative force in the universe but i don't think it's it's sent in i i mean i think the so i do not understand the universe so who am i to say you know that that god doesn't exist i am an atheist but i'm not an angry atheist right i have lots of i have lots of there are some people i know that are angry atheists and say you know cranky say that religious people are stupid i don't think that's the case i have faith in some things because i don't i mean when i was a kid i kept like you know i was like well i need to know what the charge of electron is i'm like i can't measure the charge on electron that was you know i was just gave up and had faith okay yeah you know resistors worked so when it comes to i want to know why the universe is growing in the future and what humanity is gonna become and i've seen that the the acquisition of knowledge via the generation of novelty to produce technology has uniformly made humans' lives better mhmm i would love to continue that tradition and you said that there's that creative force do you do you think just to think on that point do you think there's a creative force like what is there like a thing like a driver that's like that's creating stuff yeah i think that so i think that and where what what is can you describe it like mathematical well i think selection i think selection selection is the force selection is the force in the universe that creates novelty so is selection somehow fundamental like what what yeah i think persistence of objects that could decay into nothing mhmm through operations that maintain that structure i mean think about it if it's it's amazing that things exist at all that we're just not a big commentarial mess yes so the fact and they exist and it they put the a thing that exists persists in time yeah may i mean let's think maybe the universe is actually in the present the things everything that can exist in the present does exist well that would mean it's deterministic right no i i think the universities might so the universe started super super small the past was deterministic there wasn't much going on mhmm and it was able to mine mine mine mine mine mhmm and so the the process i mean is somehow generating the universe is basically i can't put i'm trying to put this into what did you just say there's no free will though no i didn't say that as if sorry sorry exist i said there is free will i think i think i i i'm saying that free will occurs at the boundary between the the present future the past and the future yeah i gotcha but everything that can exist does exist everything that is so everything that's possible to exist at this so now i'm really there's a lot of loaded words there in that area there's a time element loaded into that stuff i i think that the universe is able to do what it can in the present right yeah and then i think in the future there are other things that could be possible we can imagine lots of things but they don't all happen sure so what that's where that's where that's where you're going to sneak in free will right there yeah so i guess what i'm saying is what what exists is a com is a convolution of the past with the present and the free will going into the future or we could still imagine stuff right we could imagine stuff that will never happen and it's amazing force because you're this is a the most important thing that we don't understand is our imaginations can actually change the future in a tangible way which is what fit the fit the initial conditions in physics cannot predict like your imagination has a causal consequence in the future isn't that weird to you yeah i do it breaks it breaks the laws of physics as we know them right now yeah so you think the imagination has a causal effect on the future yeah but it does exist in there in the head and there must be a lot of power in whatever is going on there could be a lot of power whatever is going on in there if we then go back to initial conditions yeah and that is simply not possible that can happen but if we go into if we go into a universe where we accept that there is a finite ability to represent numbers and you have round well not rounding errors you have some that there's some what happens the your ability to make decisions imagine and do stuff is at that interface between the certain and the uncertain it's not as yasha was saying to me randomness goes and you just you know randomly do random stuff it is that you are set free a little on your trajectory free will is about being able to explore on this narrow trajectory that allows you to build you have a choice about what you build or that choice is you interacting with a future in the present what to you is most beautiful about this whole thing the universe the the the fact it seems to be very undecided very open mhmm the fact that every time i think i'm getting towards an answer to a question there are so many more questions that make the the chase you know do you hate that it's gonna be over at some point for you no i i well for me i don't so i i i i think if you think about it is it over for newton now newton has had causal consequences in the future we discuss him all the time his ideas but not the person the person just had a lot of causal power when he was alive but oh my god one of the things i wanna do is leave as many easter eggs in the future when i'm gone to go oh that's cool would you be very upset if somebody made it like a good link large language model that's fine tuned to lee koner it would be quite boring because i mean i mean i i mean no novelty generation i would i i mean if it's a faithful representation of what i've done in my life that's great that's that's a interesting artifact mhmm but i think the most most interesting thing about know knowing each other is we don't know what we're gonna do next sure sure i mean within some constraints i've got you know you might i i can predict some things about you you can predict some things about me but we can't predict everything everything and it's because we can't predict everything is why we're excited to come back and discuss and see it's so yeah i'm i'm i'm i'm kinda i'm happy that it'll be interesting that some things that i've done can be captured but i'm pretty sure that my angle on mining novelty from the future will not be captured yeah yeah so that that's what life is it's just some novelty generation and then you're done each one of us just generate a little bit i think or have the capacity to at least i think life is a selection produces life and life affects the universe and the universes with life in them are materially and physically fundamentally different than universes without life and that's super interesting and i i have no beginnings of understanding i think maybe this is like in a thousand years there'll be a new discipline and the humans will be like yeah of course this is how it all works right and in retrospect it will all be obvious i think i think assembly theory is obvious that's why a lot of people got angry right they were like oh my god this is such nonsense yeah you know and like oh you know actually it's not quite but the the writing's really bad well i can't wait to see where it evolves lee and i i'm glad i get to exist in this universe with you you're a fascinating human this is always a pleasure i hope to talk to you many more many more times and i'm a huge fan of just watching you create stuff in this world and thank you for talking today it's a pleasure as always lex thanks for having me on thanks for listening to this conversation with lee cronin to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from carl sagan we can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
