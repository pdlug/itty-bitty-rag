the following is a conversation with ye the legendary artist producer and designer formerly known as kanye west and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this podcast we got shopify for ecommerce insighttracker for biomonitoring expressvpn for privacy and athletic greens for nutrition choose wisely my friends and now onto the full ad reads as always no ads in the middle i hate those they interrupt the conversation and i hate it when long form conversations interrupted still if you happen to want to listen to these i try to make them interesting but go ahead and skip them if you must but still check out the sponsors in the description i enjoy their stuff maybe you will too this show is brought to you by shopify a platform designed for anyone to sell anywhere with a great looking online store that brings your ideas to life and tools to manage day to day operation so since this conversation is with ye the artist formerly known as kanye west i should mention that i got a chance to hang out with him all day and discuss many things but one of the things we talked about is design fashion design i got a chance to try out some of the things he's working on sort of early ideas middle ideas and it's cool to just explore the way he thinks about design how detail oriented he is how you can spend you know minutes if not hours on a very specific detail and even with people like me who are not deeply knowledgeable about fashion at least like the behind the scenes of fashion he's still able to make it clear to me and have a brainstorm with me and just talk and i mean the creative fire is there no matter what he's going on through his personal life the creative fire is burning bright and that's really beautiful

shopify dot lex that's all lowercase this show is also brought to you by our longtime friends insight tracker a service i use to track biological data basically using signals that come from your body and then take those signals and use machine learning algorithms to give you advice on diet and lifestyle changes the amount of data that comes from your body is fascinating and the fact that we're not capturing that data we don't have devices or systems that while respecting the privacy are able to collect that data to give you just you not somebody else just you advice on all kinds of things on what to read next what to eat to maximize your well-being your productivity your everything long term happiness and growth and all that kind of stuff it's just obvious to me that that's where the world is moving it should be moving there's a lot of different trajectories that you can hurt people to doing that by being not transparent being opaque about how the data is used who it's sold to all that kind of stuff but as long as you respect the privacy and the value the power of that data i think you could do some magical things that help a lot of people especially in health and medicine i mean it's obvious and insidetracker is one of the great companies that represents that get special savings for a limited time when you go to insidetracker dot com slash lex this show is also brought to you by expressvpn i use them to protect my privacy on the internet i'm actually talking to the creator of tor on the podcast soon which is a fascinating technology there's so many interesting technologies that explore the way which you achieve privacy and the levels of privacy you're comfortable with i think the first line of defense that everybody should be using you know when when privacy is needed especially is a vpn and expressvpn has been the one i've used for many many years it's the one i love the most i think it's the best it's most importantly it's super fast works on any device including whatever operating system you use linux yes yes the greatest operating system linux it works on it works on beautifully with a big button big sexy button that you press and it all just works super easy super fun life is simple you know the best security is easy security like making sure you do the low hanging fruit stuff also make sure using password manager or don't use the same password every whatever you do just stop using password one two three four five six that doesn't make it more secure if you keep adding numbers after the password or it does a little bit but not much anyway go to express v p n dot com slash lex pod for an extra three months free last but certainly not least the legend the greatest sponsor of all time this show is brought to you by athletic greens and it's ag one drink i actually noticed that they sponsor a lot of podcast which in some weird way makes me feel like it makes you feel both joyful that a lot of people are spreading the word but also it makes me feel like it's less of a secret that somehow i discovered you know it's like when you were a fan of green day before they were cool oh man are you you're like a pearl jam or whatever whatever the band when they were not as popular as there there are today that you love them that's how i feel about athletic greens but probably i wasn't even the first wave of people that discovered and enjoy athletic greens i'm probably like the fifth wave the tenth wave and now it's like the fifteenth wave and so like i'm incorrectly from a historical perspective making myself feel like i'm the og of a lot of greens the og of ag but probably not anyway i love them and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter where i am in the waves i hope you love them too it's a great way to support your nutritional health i drink one twice a day now it's refreshing even when i'm traveling their travel packs are great they'll give you one month supply of fish oil which i also take when you sign up at athletic greens dot com slash lex this is a lex fridman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's yay based off of our connection and just you being a friend i need to show you my two tech companies and get your perspective on it because now i have friends that can give a perspective like when i would work on albums i had other friends that worked on albums and they would give me their perspectives on it you wanna do this we are doing it this is part of it this is part of it absolutely alright beautiful oh well i wanted to finish the thing is okay you're gonna ask me different questions but i'm about growing and building and bringing the idea to life so when i see you i say oh this guy understands how to hire engineers where i'm coming from coming from hollywood coming from press coming from media all of the guys you know that so many of the guys that have been like voices and faces and talking heads whatever have not understood how to engineer product and that's the reason why i was able to jump past everyone in the entertainment field and become you know whatever the net worth is eleven billion i'm a stop putting the whole black thing on my worth like let's just see where i am on the scale of life because that's a cop out for me to say richest black guy of all time because that's feeding into the same you know trauma economy that black lives matter feeds into that's why i love and respect engineers that's the only thing that we really need to teach in school is engineering we don't need to teach history we don't need to teach anything that is subjective it needs to only be engineering taught in school and everything else needs to be recess nothing that at all any force subjective information is just to weaken and indoctrinate our species and that's what schools do now as an engineer i love hearing you say that but to push back history is not the interpretation of history might be subjective but history has some facts and they're useful to give a grounding to the way you do engineering i don't one hundred percent believe in anything any concept of the future or any concept of history because history was just written by the victors yeah that's right if i see stuff happen on the day that later that day is reported wrong so how wrong is something reported a thousand years ago and why would we argue about something that's not in the now because that's the only thing that everyone can agree upon is that it is now right now yeah well you try not to make the mistakes of the past that's the usefulness of history the limited usefulness of history biggest mistake from the past that we keep making is looking at the past too much giving too much value to the past too much value to the past we are now we are now we are here we are one species we are one race we're here and it's time and the leadership is changing because you have elon as a leader yay as a leader and we are the top leaders we're more influential than the presidents so you're a human being with engineering challenges before you with stem player with parlor what's the hardest thing in front of you on the engineering front that's the first sentence that any of our species needs to hear when they're born you are a human being with engineering challenges and i consider consider challenges to be opportunities in front of you yeah literally like let let me see a piece for you i need to write that down that's the beginning that's a good line of our new species constitution i'm a do the page paper like this wide yeah yeah put it in widescreen this this for ridley you are no let me like u yeah r a being with engineering opportunities or challenges opportunities i'm sorry i don't spell as good as john legend opportunities and before you i like the before because it could mean actually it could mean forward or before you this right here i've always said i'm the top five writer in human existence but this is like this right here is pushing me to like number four or number three it's a good line because who would you say is the top it's top writer in human existence we know who it is that's subjective who's that it's factual though exactly it's like who okay who's the top person in tech history it's not subjective wow there's a nonsubjective answer to both of those both of those people have influence thirty percent of our existence so the influence is the is the main metric i of greatness okay one person yeah thirty percent of our language was the the english language was written by them the other person thirty percent of the products we use was led by them so thirty percent of our language remember oh shakespeare and it was and then the product product product product but but steve jobs yeah you put steve above like elon's of the world because steve is a designer not he's a designer and engineer but he's design he's a visionary in the design space well i would lean to him because i'm not an engineer right so i'm more like then you're an engineer if if steve is an engineer you're an engineer essentially he's a cultural engineer like the people who run the emotions of the world and run the world off of people's emotions right now are social engineers and social engineering is so important like like city design there's a fancier word for that but i was i was in oxnard last night to see anthony jeselnik mhmm and i gotta find out what his opening joke was because i'm doing interviews and i'm thinking i'm funny and i like that he said he just kept on saying twenty year anniversary i've been doing this for twenty years mhmm and his opening joke was so high level i realized that i wasn't funny i realized that this dude is a professional at what he does and so many things are subjective i always talk about this it's like you know people are arguing like is emily ratajkowski the hottest you know person and i'm like that's such a subjective thing but like if you go and shoot three pointers with steph curry it's not subjective right or if you go and compare bank accounts with elon it's not subjective and another thing that's not subjective porn what about it dick size it's not subjective you could measure but porn is more about more than just dick size and greatness is more than the size of the bank account right so there's a subjective is subjective though right so you do do you care about the stuff that's objective or subjective more because greatness to me is what matters the bank account comes and goes the impact on our society like you said social engineering the impact on the collective intelligence of our species that would permeates throughout the rest of the time i like what you said the impact i'm taking notes how did you what did you say the impact collective intelligence of our species the impact on the collective and time when ye is writing down the words that came out of my dumb mouth i have made it in life there's a lot of people that have kinda like sit through sat through i wanted to wear a different color hoodie because i was just tired of seeing this hoodie in all the interviews and there's a lot of kids that are with me they see what i'm saying yeah and they had to sit through all of the muck of all the previous interviews to get to this every interview has been just an emotional it's just like been an argument up to this point this is the first of this is the next frontier of where our species is gonna head it starts here it starts with you lex so this is the first time i heard you say the word engineering at least so many times which i love hearing so this is where you're at you're like that newborn you're a being with engineering opportunities yeah and we're all a a newborn because in christianity we say born again we're all newborns and everyone can everyone shell i don't like the word can shell the only thing about shell is like it kinda dictates and can kind of kind of lets people off the hook mhmm so i haven't found the perfect post shakespeare and post steve jobs and post elon and post ye and post drake way to communicate this but we update and we do and what the current media structure no it's not actually nothing that's holding us there's nothing actually holding us back because i'm still alive i'm still alive like they coulda killed me at you know george wish don't care about black people they coulda killed me at beyonce had the best video but we're here now so we just keep on leaning and leaning and leaning and there's these things where i just think about you know there'll be times when i'm at war and every now and then when the when the bomb stopped going off and all the headlines and the smearing and all that stopped going off i think about my family and i think about kim and i think about how you know king koopa has her in the castle right now and just on mario brothers you know how it is just go for the princess and you get to this level and it's like i i i'm like i i sung the song wrong right and then they take the princess again which one are you mario yeah what's your favorite thing the thing you love the most about kim from a mario perspective and the princess looking back was there a moment she's definitely my favorite of all time yeah was there a moment that you know like that catches you off guard and you say i love this human being yeah i mean it's just the the dna is like she's a mix of rob and chris can you explain i mean that's like a really high pool right there those are like two geniuses so okay so like the entire of history of evolution of the human species created this dna they created this being there's a life there there's a set of memories and the history that brought you together and you're like damn i like this dna yeah and so certain people have just like high dna ivanka trump has high dna you know it's like how's your dna pretty good i i i think we've seen that it's been proven i mean but look at my look at my mom and look at my dad you know me and my dad have a water purification center in the doctor right now and my my dad is the original steve jobs and he was blocked by people around him and people were using him and taking advantage and you know not believing in his vision he's my dad's the educated version of ye what'd you learn about life from your dad my dad got girls too but those are small details that's a big detail meaning that i found my dad's you know playboy when i was five years old it it it greatly affected my motivation yeah alright so that's part of the engine that drives yay absolutely i remember when pharrell was first in all the videos and my girl was like girls like pharrell and i was like i want girls to like me too funny that that's behind all the ambition all the drive that's how we make people it's how people are made it's the desire to be loved is that at the individual level just being noticed and also at the societal level of scale well now i've i've gone past i'm like at that place where nikola tesla was later into his career where it wasn't about being loved it wasn't about sitting at the dinner parties next to anna wintour and stuff it was about getting the idea across so i have these cells that are very and i just keep on saying ridley scott but ridley scott has a special anointing it isn't just sci fi what he's doing there's something in there just like george lucas there's something different that's there so what are you drawing i'm drawing these new living cells that we will exist in mhmm and this is over okay let's do like i don't like talking about money because like man made money anyway is like four quadrillion respected dollars and then you have other forms of currency of course social currency is super important right now but this is a drawing and it's at a pretty good place now this would be forty thousand square feet i wanna start just talking in meters i just think we should go to anything to restore the tower of basel like they said when the i'm just gonna draw a person here for scale yeah that would help okay what do you think of that look at my person see the scale in this room alright so wait the dot is the person yeah i'm saying it's forty thousand square feet but that would be like what are the other parts of the cell okay so what it's a screen it doesn't go all the all the way to the top and it's one hole for light but the water and the light and air all come in from the top so that's like like the mouth and then this is the belly button we're god's iphone we're his greatest creation so the this is all connected these are all connected yes i'm drawing how these other cells go next to each other what's the vision here happiness do we talk about like what's the motivation like yeah there's a motivation somewhere in the back of my mind of my family and if it's like where moses smithed the rock and god didn't allow him to get to the promised land because the promised land is family that is the problem that is earth i mean that is heaven on earth is family family is heaven that's the promised land and for your family to be together so say i smite the rock and god doesn't let me have my family back my mission in life is still to promote families at all costs and make families' existence easier so you take this thing you put localized a localized farm say if it's in community that we we do localized growing and then we partner with big pharma and all and say hey you're actually gonna make more money by making better food because at the end of the day you want money right now it's like everyone knows that between the pesticides and between the medical industry and especially america that we're keeping people sick and we know that mcdonald's makes food that kills people and you know coca cola's selling you know sugar water and all this like just in case i haven't pissed off enough people in power yeah okay so you're gonna piss off the sugar any anybody that's powered on sugar sugar well sugar west the health was actually a document documentary on sugar it wasn't about how bad meat was it was like a reverse documentary on sugar a refer i don't know if you call it a reverse like a sub but if you watch it again when they show sugar and it's just the sugar looks super clean yeah just so as as i state as i state these things i know that i know i have protection if i have god's protection that's why i'm here to this date right so it it's for me to have this platform and express exactly what i feel because it's kids out there right that it's kids that are gonna save the world through engineering and through facts and i've gotta get download as much of the information and as much of the don't be afraid to state your facts is the biggest thing because the world is being ran by fear and that is no actually god runs the world but there's just like little cloud this patina of our ego that deals with the money and the car and the girl we're dating and all this in the clothes we wear and spending too much on clothes and a lot of stuff that i've been involved with promoting so now what i'm promoting is you have the idea you say it out loud like you like if you had tourette's say your truth out loud if you hate yay you hate me say that out loud say whatever you feel out loud like you say it nonviolently you know nonviolent non violent i have to say that like as you know you know as a shout out to alex jones you know and trump where they try to say that when they say their truths out loud that it's inciting violence so let's be like really clear i'm saying that they have criminalized free thought the you know they i hate when people use they like they gets the blame for everything right it's always they yeah who who the fuck is they exactly the problem is they is us yeah well i love that what we needed to do is turn i to we so we take the responsibility and turn they to us so we take accountability to us they to i to we and they to us and that relates it's a language at the same time you're seeing the language of our surroundings you're seeing the language of i mean one of one of the things okay let's go back to the cell explanation because i'm also doing a what's that thing when elon just put all the information in the open and people could figure out if they could figure it out and open source yeah open source so i'm open sourcing this idea right now so that you know engineers and anointed people beings anointed beings can collectively contribute to this to push our species forward so where i've got to with my research is that there will be a hole at the top that allows natural light natural air and there's a constant water system so it becomes like a water city where it's a constant flow that's not it's it's regenerative it's not wasting the water and it's just a constant flow so i put the toilet really close to where this this i don't wanna call it a wave pool but in the pool the water is not still so that exists in in water surrounded by water well the living room is the you you have two rooms you have the dry room which people would call the living room before and then you have the wet room how is that a source of happiness what what is broken about our world today that that gives you in terms of the pursuit of happiness which is one of the things well all of our previous declaration of all of our buildings are based on just the industry and the economy and then people lean into what people are used to seeing like what we think is attractive because then you go back to the you know women who give life so everyone wants to be attractive to the attractive and that's the reason why the media goes and gets you know bella hadid kim kardashian emily ratajkowski those are the only ones i'm gonna there's more there's more but i'm i'm thinking the ones that i think are attractive yeah it is subjective yeah because it's subjective so to my subjective which i think i think the only guys that could argue with me on on my opinion on girls would be brad and leo because we're the only ones with the track record you know everything else so for everybody else it's subjective we've got history so are you are you are you happy absolutely i'm just here it's actually it's difficult to make me unhappy now i could deal with frustrations but when those frustrations are it's like when you've allowed people to be in your life that shouldn't be there and then they do the thing you knew they were gonna do and you're screaming at them but you really need to scream at yourself yeah so you realize anything that's like anger or frustration that's something that's wrong with you that needs to be dealt with yes like right now okay say i got this pattern cutter that i wanted to remove because i felt like she was copying our patterns into the computer and i didn't know why she wanted to do that and i just wanted to do the patterns by hand and then you know you mean like automating the patterns is that what you mean am i ahead of it because they just that's the whole thing it's like it's a war of it's a war of human beings and robots and so but that makes it more efficient right you don't like the efficiency you like the creativity of the singular nature of the pattern i believe that the human beings and i'm saying this to you as a person who makes robots and a person who's friends with you i'm deeply offended right now yeah but i'll you know i'll let it go okay good so yeah i believe that the yeah he hates robots not i'm not gonna put that out there it's a joke robots have feelings too yeah yeah that's right that was also a joke was we need to clarify that for future robots but the pattern cutter the pattern cutter you don't like that that had to be that that's you can't have that part of your life that's not what i'm i'm my everything that i'm doing is for the sake of the human race there's things in capitalism there's things in technology will tech technology and original human species can exist in a peaceful way as long as the people that know how to make robots aren't using their robots to control the humans lex definitely something you have to be concerned about as we become more technologically savvy that my friend is why engineering isn't everything that you have to desperately study the lessons of history in nazi germany science was used to create atrocities engineering the same engineering could be a tool of war we we are still in the holocaust a friend a jewish friend of mine said oh come go visit the holocaust museum and my response was let's visit our holocaust museum planned parenthood with all due respect i grew up in the soviet union i'm jewish parts of my family perished in the in the holocaust of nazi germany i have to push back that there is a difference of the atrocities at that scale at that time on an entire people gonna say the number that's the difference it's not the number because six million well also african americans are actually jew also the lost tribe of i can push back on that too okay so well everyone came from africa i am african i'm basically african american we're brothers and we're both jew and we're brothers so we're human six million people died in the holocaust over twenty million have died by the hands of abortion and the media promotes the my body my choice which is actually still a promotion for planned parenthood fifty percent of black deaths a year is actually abortion it's not it's not the cop with the knee it's not black on black violence and gang violence it's not heart attacks it's actually abortion the most dangerous place for a black person in america is in their mother's stomach there's nine hundred to a million abortions in the united states a year i hear you but there's something about the rape the torture the murder of children women men the complete complete humiliation and just the suffering that was endured during world war two that's what we deal with on our tvs right now with black people soros would use black trauma economy for to win an election and what i love is having a healthy conversation and as opposed to there's certain things you know boom this drops people gonna have pussy hats on boom this drops is gonna be you know black people and white people with signs boom this drops so hey china hey left agenda hey what we're gonna do is say that our species can have a healthy conversation do you it's can i just linger on this because when you say jewish media it there's a echo of a pain that people feel that reminds you you're saying it's you're saying it's redundant right no i'm not saying it's redundant i'm saying redundant you're saying it's redundant it's a i'm saying it's something that you're i'm saying that it's something that joseph goebbels the propaganda minister of nazi germany said i'm saying it's been said so many times in order to murder and torture jewish people that it just rings wrong and and that's the thing like the n word when spoken by people that have the same skin color as me it reminds people of a very dark time i know if if jewish people would accept that i'm jew then they would see what i'm saying in a different way they would hear it in a different way but see the people you saying you're jewish that no i'm jew not jew ish jew ish means like that of a jew i'm saying i'm jew you're a jew blood of christ that comes from right but that the are you are you a follower of the philosophy of the black hebrew israelites because that's where the idea comes from not all of those folks are extremists but some are extremists i'm a follower of the idea i have a vague idea that all people came from africa but what i wanted to do yeah not okay now i could andy kaufman this about seven more minutes yeah and then tell you what it is what i should i count let's count seven minutes no or what i did this to do a spoiler alert sure spoiler what's the first thing i said at the beginning we're talking about engineering and humans we're all and i said and then what did i say we shouldn't focus on race not just that i said they shouldn't teach this in school history the history because what they do what schools are doing is exactly what the cia does with pixar films and disney films they make bambi's mom die in the beginning right and off that pain comes a purchase of ice cream off that pain comes i need some more toys off that pain comes i need a bigger house off that pain comes i need more girls than my wife off that pain comes so they put that pain in to make us now we're the orphans of capitalism to make us be consumers and we need to be a community not just consumers so i could've went another seven minutes yeah by being a person who presents himself in a way that says well i don't have to feel your pain because i also have pain too that's not being recognized and in every interview when i say well why did i get to the point of putting up the tweet no one wants to understand why i got to that point right you had pain you had pain yeah but no one pain in your heart but the let's say this undoubtedly jewish people have a lot of movies about that pain and black people have a lot of movies about the pain of slavery right it's almost impossible to find a movie about mansa munsa when you go to the african history museum in washington dc it doesn't start with the idea of africans being kings it starts with the idea of africans being slaves but here's another interesting point about this this was said to me one time and it stuck with me as a family member of mine with africans how many times you've heard like a rapper you know talk about we were kings that's incorrect if we're jew if we're jew and since we are we weren't the kings we were the slaves that moses freed africans have always said we've heard you've listened to rap music and hear black people say we kings we blood of the pharaohs and if we are jew then we weren't we were the people that moses freed and when we talk about have you heard black people talk about four hundred years of slavery mhmm alright that is in rep and we're having this history lesson right and history doesn't matter you're exploring ancient history and drawing deep wisdom from it and at the same time saying we need to forget all of it we need to put that behind us absolutely we need to forget it and we need to move forward there is so much wisdom to draw from history even the twentieth century look at this communism without the the lessons of history of the twentieth century communism sounds like a great idea except that some of the worst atrocities conducted by stalin and mao that killed fifty hundred plus million people not just killed tortured starvation where people the cannibalism they ate each other they ate their children there's the there's just dark people people should read some books on this on the hollywood in nineteen thirties but i disagree lesson we would and now it's becoming more popular marxism and communism i'm not disagreeing that that happened i'm disagreeing that we need to harp on the things that happened because the truth is i'm giving a fact fifty percent today of let's say you don't call black people jew right black people's deaths today is abortion today right now like that it's not racism that's too wide of a term it's genocide and population control that black people are in today in america that is promoted by the music and the media that black people make that jewish record labels get paid off of or media companies record labels and media company also so let's give it a wider you know i agree with martin luther king i have a dream too martin luther king what's day you would not be judged mhmm by the color of your skin or your race black or jew but by the content of your character all the assholes that fucked you over in the music industry fuck artists over in the music industry are individuals they're not jews can you can you they are they are jewish it doesn't they're human with opportunities and they took those opportunities i don't care if they're jewish do you feel like i should release that that pain and separate it yes okay so if that if okay so if you're saying i should release that pain and separate it then i'm telling you you should release your pain and separate it and we could get to this the list of how you are being with engineering opportunities that's hundred percent i see what you're doing that exactly you're doing the pain i'm gonna let it go engineering challenges i get it one of the problems you highlight is people get fucked over in the in the music industry and get fucked over in the media get fucked over all over the place they created there was a there was a jewish trainer that brought me to the hospital and put in press that i went to the hospital i got i know friends that off of exhaustion a jewish doctor they diagnosed me jewish because they were right diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and shot me with medication and put me on medication then put it in the press and every time even if i wore the wrong color hat that a is not supposed to wear right then they immediately say he's off of his shit he's off his meds he's off his rocker and it's literally used as a scarlet letter control mechanism for the people understand the kids the colleges the high schools where do you think they put me right now they put me as the prophet not the leader it doesn't have to be the leader right because we we need we need a more intelligent person to be the leader but at least right they put me as the prophet they put me as the only person that would say this and i'm just saying that was four jewish members that controlled my voice because for the fact that ninety percent of black people in entertainment from sports to music to acting are in some way tied into jewish business people meaning that in some way just like if if rahm is sitting next to obama or jared's sitting next to trump there's a jewish person right there controlling the the the country the jewish people controlling that who gets the best video or not controlling what the media says about me person not jewish let me just say one thing but they are though that's the only thing it just so happens that they are it just happens that they are that doesn't mean that i hate them yes sir that just means that they are but it's a it's a dog whistle too let me let me just say as i would love to add more love to the world i would love you to do that as a person with a big voice with a big powerful voice that a lot of people look up to and when you say jewish media it's funny how this world works that way when you say jewish media or jews are controlling the voice of black artists black people black artists when you say that am i not allowed to say it out loud you can say it there's a large number of people that are hurting and have anger and even have hate in their heart when they hear when they hear jewish media they start that hate starts being directed towards the jewish people do you acknowledge that that's do you understand do can you feel the hate in the world that's when that that comes to the surface when you say stuff like that okay i i feel that when we go into therapy my dad was a therapist and obviously i've got some therapy skills myself a lot of people my music is healing these type of spa like existences are healing the color palettes i use are healing and we can use healing words right what i really feel there i feel that there's no accountability and no responsibility on jewish people in media to at least start with owning up with the facts of what's dealt with and tell me if i say the facts out loud to to the point of ari emanuel writing a letter in the financial times trying to take food out of my children's mouth telling people that they're not allowed to work with me even chris como or piers morgan getting me to apologize and separate jewish business people to from the families of the jewish business people which i did update i did that that already happened and the way a shitty apology that wasn't really an apology but shout out for that conversation here's a great conversation on my knees and kiss the dick of howard stern and you don't need to kiss anyone's dick i don't know what you guys are acting like you guys look at that because you're talking about it as a shitty opinion apology but where's our fucking apology watch this sorry we don't we don't get thank you not that let's move on sorry oh do i need to get on my knees or no and kiss my dick oh shit so it just escalated quickly so that's escalated quickly so nice the so what no no i'm saying where's our apology but we're right we can't get to apology because you're telling me there's no right way for me to word it so tell me for me a person who's been fucked on my deals and a person that has friends that never figured out how to make shoes with a german company that couldn't tell me to wear a blm shirt and take off my red hat like what would've happened if i was at nike right tell me exactly how to engineer the situation i'm in you exactly how you got a big voice have the balls as a man to call out the individuals don't call them jews call them by their name and start a war against those individuals they're not jewish but if that's the case will you help me with that sure okay hundred percent assholes are ask well let me like flip that too i don't understand the industry well i i i see that people are fucking people over for sure but how do you solve that if you run if you right now run the world's you're doing a million things but say you ran also a record label i have ran a record well i've been ran by a record label where i was the face of a record label and had big sean and different people complaining to me and i knew fuck about running a record label i was simply just a talented producer and an influencer yes that then start a good music but i wasn't the one running good music how would you do it differently this is something i i propose i would look at the top ten execs in three fields in sports film and music and i would look at the top ten clients participant act talent i would look at the top talent in each of those field the top ten of them and some of them are gonna be tom brady some of them are gonna be taylor swift some of them they're not all gonna be black right some of them so some of them will be adele right and we'll look at all their contracts transparently and will compare the notes and reengineer like it's a new constitution yeah because when i told my dad when i was nineteen that i was gonna get into the music industry he begged me not to he said i heard it's treacherous now i'm in a position where i've been through it i saw it i went out made some money somewhere else i saw my name get smeared i saw my family get destroyed i saw my reputation get destroyed and i'm back here to have this kinda i'm back here as a being with engineering opportunities so wait a second if you say it's a shitty apology what is the version of the apology short of kissing howard stern's dick i don't think anyone wants to kiss howard stern's dick that's the whole point howard stern nobody wants to kiss your dick so shut the fuck up i said and by the way i'm antagonizing you howard stern i used to be a fan of you yeah me too yeah now i'm still a fan sometimes now now you're just doing clickbait like everybody else now you're just a sad old man howard alright now howard stern this is the first time anyone's said your name in years your own family doesn't say your name unless they're calling to get their bills paid you're going hard i'm just see that's beautiful right there that's much better than calling jewish media call go after individuals okay so after individuals if you don't talk shit about me talk shit about me this is great and you know what that is yeah what's that engineering that's an engineer's approach yeah engineers yeah yeah you should learn some of that we all can use our pain against each other yeah or we can say we're being with engineering opportunities and we can know about history so let me change something we can have a just to be judgmental people say thou shall not judge i was talking to camille vasquez she says i'm very judgmental that's what we're doing we i i i believe now you could go to one thing's gonna say one thing another thing may be contradicted in a way and then the pastor has to unpack it i believe that we are to judge if you look at some food and it's got a fly coming out of it you can then judge at that point you're supposed to use your better judgment but whenever someone doesn't wanna change something they're doing they'll say don't judge me right but as a species you called for me you got the breakthrough and by the way it's only a engineer that i would respect yeah to tell me of how of how to update how i'm communicating because this started off right i've been through all these interviews let me go to this you said this was a sorry apology i was very specific i said the jewish because by the way it's a barrage right it's a thing where i don't even remember the names at a certain point right it's like if a if a girl was getting raped by men if that person's not eighteen right and she was getting raped since fourteen right and she still got this face this super like irina shayk level face right she might say i hate men that woman may say i hate men she might get to that point because she was raped on my contracts and no one can say this is ramped up no one howard stern can't say this is ramped up ari emanuel can't say this is ramped up george soros knows damn well that i'm not ramped up george soros knows like wow this guy is like a younger guy that's looking at what i did and looking at how i control the world silently and he's calling it out and he's not using any of the fear tactics i can't send his homeboys around him i can't send his wife to him this guy that's what george soros sees right when he's dealing with me right so what you guys are actually asking me to do i'm comparing myself to that eighteen year old beautiful woman that had been mistreated by men for four years of her life right and you're saying you know as a man you can't blame all men and i'm saying as a responsible forward philosopher leader okay i'll drop the pain and i will specify because i'm up here i lost my fucking family i lost my kids i lost my best friend in fashion i lost i lost the black community i lost you know people said i lost my mind all of these things lost my reputation and i'm up here just like i just want my family but i don't want my family to have to say what the left wants us to say i to have to say what china wants us to say i wanna be an american and protect my kids and protect my wife and raise my kids as christians and have my wife be a christian and innovate and america made rock and roll i wanna innovate as a creative person and be a successful american but all of that had been taken away from me so i'm coming back and i'm removing the pstd right now right i'm standing up and saying the only way that we're gonna be able to get past this and the way god is gonna use me right now is for me to stop talking about the pain stop talking about what happened and do something about it and that's where i'm at right now in this moment like yeah people agree at least there was something where you could say he has a reason of why he got to that tweet and what you're doing for me today is saying yo that was a sorry apology and let's specify i'm not asking for anyone out here to empathize or sympathize for a you know a dude worth eleven billion dollars that can make money disappear i mean appear at a thin air in five different industries you know i'm not asking for the i'm not asking for anybody to sympathize with someone who's married to kim kardashian dated irene and shay blah blah blah blah like i i feel like i'm just not gonna get the sympathy vote in this situation right so i feel your pain i feel your pain yeah i feel like no one's gonna feel my pain only only brad and leo could feel my pain right so the so but still but here today when you said it's a sorry apology what's the what's the apology that you're looking for as a as a jewish engineer oh no no say as lex let's not talk about you being jewish as lex what's the apology that you want me to say to am i allowed to say jewish tell me is it anti semitic for ye to say jewish out loud no there's i don't like the allowed that presumes censorship i think you choose you have a powerful voice you free did i prove did i did i prove that there was censorship over the past two weeks i proved that censored you oh drink champs who's oh my lord oh like twitter and so on twitter that has less to do drink champs that hurt you the drink champs that noor took it down took down your conversation no it didn't hurt you i've man you gotta be honest about that thing we're still the kids we used to be i put my hand on the stove to see if i still bleed and nothing hurts anymore i feel kind free no do you think you know i i went to japan for two to three months right the day i had sunday service my kids are supposed to be there and my kids were nowhere to be found and i text kim and say where are my kids we get into a argument and then i get a text from a number i don't know and it's pete davidson bragging about being in bed with my wife then just fucking with you well at that point it's like they're trying to put me in jail or put a friend of mine in jail because then i'm gonna go surround the hotel and do all you know do something which would have me not be able to be here and instead i walked away from that situation i went to japan like the samurai that i am and went to the top of the mountain and because i knew that i mean i knew there was no way she could love this dude not just because he's ugly he's not black she likes black guys every guy that she you know is with looks exactly the same ray j reggie bush at that time kanye west she has a type just like how i have a type like a lot of my girls look kinda similar to her because in a video game character people have people have their type right so i knew that this was like the the princess has a type and she likes mario right there you go as somebody cares for you and hopefully can be a friend yay i gotta say these words and the words about jews is not the words of a samurai of a great man i would say you know you said something that inspired that resonate with a lot of people when you said george bush doesn't care about black people i have to say as somebody who cares for you that ye the artist formerly known as kanye west doesn't care about jewish people in the same way you spoke about george bush being a politician and not giving a fuck about the poor people that suffered after katrina you're not giving a fuck about the suffering of the jewish people across the world why why am i not because you're feeding you're giving strength motivation dedication updated i gave an apology you said it wasn't good enough yeah that's right it's not and now you're telling me no i'm not gonna no no you don't need to kiss anyone's dick what you you're asking me to kiss to say it was wrong to say there's no jewish media there's no jewish there isn't there's no control of the media by jewish people engineer brother if you're an engineer and you're not holding to the truth that's not engineering engineering is not that's not that doesn't that's hate that's not engineering no it's because i'm gonna build a better record label it's called and i'm going to respect our stereotypes exist for a reason engineers don't do stereotypes i do stereotypes are dumb they allow you to channel hate towards the other you know what the biggest thing is yeah with something a veteran that was sitting next to me at cheesecake factory last night he said you know the the general justice he serves for whoever is the president right and he said what's happening in politics is we're forgetting we're on the same side we're forgetting we're on this this is someone that's practically now he's a nurse so he's still you know fighting for humanity in a way he went from holding you know guns in battle to being a a nurse and when people are battling for their lives and he said we're forgetting we're on the same side this is a person that no matter who becomes president he can still be told to go to war and the chaos that's created by the media has split the country in half and what we what us as beings with the engineer opportunity need to do right now is find the blue water where do we where are places that we agree on and i want you to finish everything hey i'm a let you finish everything i've heard that before you want to express to me get off all i'm your i'm your scarecrow today i'm your i'm your punching bag today for everything i did and i want you to stand up for all of the hate that i'm your al gore when he lost the election remember he almost became a punching bag for the lady that had voted on him and she just said all this stuff and he's like i know i agree with you right but there's nothing you know that he could do about it with this it's like things that you're saying i agree with you you know it's like if you sit some kids in the in the principal's office and i punch somebody right i took i took my hand right as what it really means even ari emanuel had to say this is a pop icon right and i went and just punched an entire people at one time or said that i was about to i went like this right and i get blacked out black mirrored done right and it's like what were you even gonna do and why did you go like this i went like this because i i can't even do i would i would look insane to physically show you a metaphor a a a a physical representation of my last twenty years of what i've been through as a musician as a father and as a black person with a political opinion a great man still through the pain does the right thing and i think the right thing is to not say that there's jewish control of the media and the incorrect though that's a fucking lie there is and they did come and bully me it proved the point no the reason you don't say it why is because the world is much bigger than the forgive me the narrow little world you exist in your impact stretches way past those little boardroom meetings over contracts so what should i have done what should i have done not say that you should be a strong man that doesn't mention that doesn't mention religion or people and then fight do you wanna win this fight how do i win how do we win call out individual people built that's one way because they have a big voice the other voice that i prefer is to build another label i feel or support label that you're controlling my creative narrative and my because just like how you're telling me i shouldn't have said that do you think there are people telling me i shouldn't have wore a red hat no you because you asked me what should i have done you're supposed to be a scarecrow so i thought i'm gonna beat the shit out of the scarecrow with my words right you let me yeah it was consensual the punching bag is a bad because scarecrow actually has a different yeah that's right i'm not gonna start punching bag i shouldn't say a scarecrow yeah but every single person that i've sat with from the point when i wore the red hat till now has done the same thing sit in the principal's office and don't do what you're doing we're in the general's closet right now together yeah and i'm not the red hat is very different the red hat is you have a set of beliefs you represent half the country that has a hope a vision for the future of america that's very different than without any purpose whatsoever saying jewish media jewish control of the media you said there's there's no purpose so you're taking away my history and my reason of what my purpose was i'm saying it was also also also it could i'm speaking my voice vocalizing also yeah it's god's plan there's a lot of things that open up let me tell you something that opened up there's a guy like i told you that was running stem player who i've had issues with we hadn't got paid on top certain things right and he took his his iq his know how his engineering know how to he basically was trying to adidas me with even though i was the bigger money in the situation that was fun and we funed together and he hired these engineers and he said well because of your comments we're not gonna be able to hire anybody else and i was like well how many jewish people do we have in our company he said i don't know he didn't say exactly right i said do we have black people he said yes i said how many he said two so we have like sixty full time employees like forty half time and part time and i i took as a responsibility let's let's let's let's take a step back from the us being one species and say hey you're jewish i'm black right why step why step back for this example for the sake of this example and i said wow i'm sure i could hire more than two black engineers and what happens is because there are so many businessmen that just so happen to be jewish that it's good business right just to monopolize that's what people are looking everybody wants to be elon right so the i disagree with that okay but let me finish this point i'm i'll let you finish i'll let you finish a lot of a lot of businessmen want to be as successful as elon and as popular as elon a lot i could just word it like that which i hate the term a lot actually i wanna be more specific but i don't i haven't done the math on it let's say some factually for sure there are some business people of all different walks and backgrounds that would like to be as rich and as popular as elon musk so let me just take a a step back from the we are one species into the we're separated by race gender socioeconomic class conversation and say as a black owner of two tech platforms hardware and software i need to take action let's not call it affirmative let's just say i need to take action and i need to take accountability and ensuring that black engineers are hired and guess what hired together because when the black people that are brilliant are separated from our culture we forget who we are and we'll get to a point where you know oj is saying i'm not black i'm oj because just to be on the golf course we put on the golf shirt but the golf shirt might not be something that our culture would have done and now our culture in poor communities is oh everybody's got draco on them everybody's got a gun on them oh if you run up on me on the gas station i'm a kill you hey you ain't gotta talk to me like a man if i haven't killed at least five people but you know what happens is we can kill five people we could kill ten people and still be in the media as long as we play by the the rules right because what will happen is any of these guys that have talked about killing people and different things unless trump had pardoned them right but let's say even if trump had pardoned them they could still go to someone like a lil boosie or meek milles or puff daddy anybody and say hey we need you to talk shit about ye right now and also you're not allowed if you do wanna vote for trump or vote outside of what this arrangement is then we're gonna put you in jail it ain't now we're not gonna bring you down we have this on you you get what i'm saying if i had ever killed someone if i wasn't the bitch with the pink polo on i wouldn't be able to be the vocal man that i am today you understand what i'm saying this is the reason why i'm happy that my gangster disciple brothers kept me from the initiations which made me feel like a pussy my whole life right but now i am someone who legally can say this other people in my position they legally cannot speak they legally cannot speak mhmm or they will go to prison i am in a bit of a glass prison because i don't have say so of where my children go to school but i'm in a freedom place where i can have this conversation with you right now and that is i i don't like the word breakthrough you know that that's god's hand on this situation but you get what i'm saying about if i hadn't said the tweet i wouldn't have had to take the accountability myself to hire black engineers into my two tech platforms yeah and do you get what i'm saying that's a beautiful personal journey you're on but do you get what i'm saying that that personal is for my people as a whole as a tribal small company it's a small company as a tribal person i believe that i am my people yeah and i and and the thing that that businessmen have done to my people have pulled the brightest out of our tribes and siloed them and made us lose our culture and lose who they were all the only thing i wanted to say of virgil's funeral which i wasn't allowed to right it was a white pastor that talked the majority of the funeral half the funeral was pissed pissed right and and this pastor actually married me and kim right he looks like justin timberlake a little bit and he talked to half the funeral he knew virgil was passing did a collaboration with him before he passed by the way right a clothing collaboration i didn't know virgil was passing but the thing i wanted to say i saw asap rocky and i saw some other members of his gang you know in the audience at the funeral and all i wanted to tell him is don't let them split the gang up don't let them split the gang up when i did the first yeezy because i did kanye west two fashion shows before as a high end luxury all leather kinda designer not all leather but you know high end materials mink this kind of thing and then i came back with yeezy with adidas and this fashion show was so popular that justin bieber had to sit in the second row right this thing had every name you could think of it had kim kardashian kris jenner kendall jenner it was kylie's first fashion show she'd been in and in the second fashion show i put kylie and bella hadid next to each other in the fashion show you had puff daddy at that time puff daddy had beef with drake drake still came to the show and jay z had to break up the fight backstage the designers you had jerry lorenzo that's head of fear god you had kim schraub head of skims you had virgil abloh head of louis vuitton you had demna head of balenciaga all working for ye for the leader for the philosopher right for the person that put who put this together me that's who right you had these people working for the king in new york basically the boss yay right you had you had jay z in the audience rihanna in the audience beyonce in the audience sitting next to anna wintour in this audience and guess who heard wind of this one of the richest men in the world bernard arnault caught wind of this what's going on they're building up something and we need to stop it so then he met with me and politely offered me backing for my clothing line it would be kanye west they would get forty nine percent fifty one percent i would get forty nine percent they'd have control and they were gonna give me all of the support from louis vuitton so i had to go to adidas and i told adidas hey let's indemnify the apparel so adidas you're not gonna do the apparel anymore hey we had a we had a good time but we're gonna run off with giselle now right so the that's like you told your girl that and she's like oh no we're supposed to we had the proudest moment of our career and stuff so so then he offers me the deal and alexander arnaud who's went to gone on and rape and pillage from all of the talent that i had afterwards said i say before i tell adidas to indemnify the apparel can i get a written contract from your dad bernard arnault and he says my dad will never go back on his word you so you already know where this thing is going right yeah you can spoiler alert right he went back on his word so three months into the deal i get anna wintour i say who should i use for my lawyer she picks my lawyer for me right i just found out even a couple of days that the lawyer demanded a airplane during negotiations had nothing to do with me right they said that bernard arnault got freaked out and then alexander arnault calls me and says the deal got dropped at the board i went back and told my high maintenance wife i was supposed to become this designer at louis vuitton or the louis vuitton group was gonna back the kanye west line because that's how good i've done in fashion babe and now the deal is dropped now the deal is dropped so then i did a second collection and we didn't have any support to be able to build the collection then i went and found and third collection we did it we took over msg fourth collection went and the show started a hour late then a week later kim got robbed then i told scooter braun my manager at that time i say i i'm looking you know i need to go to japan i'm tired i'm tired he says no you need to make more money i do four more shows on a second leg of the tour and i suffer from an exhaustion and go to the hospital and then get diagnosed with a disorder this is the first time i ever suffered from exhaustion by the way i haven't been to the hospital since haven't been to the hospital since and haven't taken you know medication in two years and i'm sure there'll be people in the media we won't say where phone will say well that's obvious right so so right now i'm talking to you right i'm not on medication i just go to sleep right i have sleep have you been able to sleep this that's that's that's that's that's too low hanging fruit for you you're you're more you're i i just i agree i agree i agree i agree that was dumb i regret it oh good good good so so this out of my shit i love it but then amidst that the same guy that dropped my deal bernard arnault goes and hires my best friend mhmm goes and hires my main engineer right it would have been like them hiring you know elon from peter before they figured out paul before they figured out paypal but it it don't paul only sounds like it don't paul sounds like paul i just say it because i'm a christian i thought it was cool but it would have been like what if someone could have went in and took elon away from peter before they pay paul before they i just because they paid paul yeah yeah before they pay paul before they that it's just too close yeah too close it just sounds so fresh to the fact that it's so close right and that's that's what happened right they broke the gang up and i'm telling you right now that hadn't happened virgil's alive i'm still married you know what i'm saying the power structure was broken then right because we're building some kylie wasn't a billionaire that's you know what i mean yeah we were building something together that a french colonizer came in and caught it early and tried to destroy it but the only thing is god is alive and i'm anointed and even with those drawbacks losing my wife losing my friend exhaustion all of these late night tweets that piss off an entire group you know like this the frustration still there we work i work for god and god runs the world and we'll see what we'll see what happens but in those words don't you feel that being split up don't you feel you're doing the thing that you stand against which is playing victim aren't you playing victim to the forces in the world i didn't play i didn't even get a chance to play i just said i was about to i said like this like no you played pretty damn well uh-huh what do you mean what do you what do you mean about to you're like one of the greatest designers in history fashion designers you were playing what do you you are playing what does that even mean i thought you're referring to the tweet oh all of them there well there's a full set of things that you're under attack for the tweet and everything beyond that but like you're you're blaming not blaming but you're saying that the jewish media the jewish record labels the jewish people forget jewish or not doesn't matter is playing victim right ultimately i am fighting a battle in the spiritual form and anyone that believes in god and is looking at this interview would agree with that and i just so happen to be a bright part of god's army i'm fighting for us to live the greatest gift is life itself i am pro life i am pro god i believe that jesus christ is our lord and savior and died for our sins what do you feel about another attack another painful thing i imagine super painful is balenciaga pulling you had a really close relationship and friendship with their creative director like how do you feel about all of it i told you i sang the song i sing another song from one of my mentors future i never feel pain i done felt too much pain like there was a day where i was headed to nashville to meet with george farmer who is the ceo of parler the the day when we made the announcement at that same day balenciaga was taking my imagery off of their site and the drink champs was being taken down and i said this is the happiest day of my life i love cutting the grass low people wasn't really with you they was part time people switch up when it's wartime i'd rather have people who are really with me and not people who are just trying to use me listen as a friend if somebody cares for you you have to be really careful by the people by all people always the people that are gonna be try to be close to you now you don't know if you can trust them anymore more with the valencia i got one i have more to say about it though yeah let's do this yeah demna will still work for yay someday and this is just speeding the process up have you talked can you share if you've talked yes i'll i talked to demna this is like we're kendrick spirits none of this can keep us away from each other i brought demna to gap to be able to bring the best product in the world at that time i wanted to go under a hundred dollars now i'm like okay we're gonna go twenty dollars a product i brought demna in to engineer that's why i said engineer by balenciaga yeezy gap engineer by balenciaga to engineer the best product for the people the people that that they say are at the bottom of the maslow hierarchy and need chart they're at the they're at the bottom of the pyramid mhmm right so gap didn't want that balenciaga didn't want that our agendas were not aligned i was brought in to the gap for political reasons and influence like a virgil like a george floyd when popular celebrities are brought into fortune five hundred companies it's not to raise the stock it's to strengthen the position and influence and it's definitely not to be out here letting a nigga think he's steve jobs yeah there's people like that but you as a great man a visionary your job is to understand that game and be one step ahead well that's what i'm telling them that relationship you know some relationships only last for a summer yeah you know some last for a year the relationship ran its course you know in that relationship i invested a lot of my social capital and actual capital there i spent somewhere between five to ten million dollars personally on balenciaga how much money do you think balenciaga had paid me in the past two years just take a really wild guess a really wild less than that just take a super wild one just go to your the furthest extent of your imagination one point two million lower five hundred thousand lower zero zero alright and actually two weeks ago i paid out of saints account eight hundred and sixty two thousand dollars not in clothes for me from balenciaga from the store in royalties to balenciaga where the deal had been engineered where i was coming out of my pocket so i paid last year i paid demna three million dollars to to design the collection right and we got it out of the gap marketing fund and he was gonna deliver a hundred sixty skus or a hundred twenty skus a hundred skus are separate items of clothing so styles of clothing so we ended delivering about sixty i feel like we're on the people's court because we actually are right in the court of public opinion so he delivered about sixty there were all kinds of people that were working part of the reason why i had to get demna like i didn't wanna have to i wanted to compete with him i didn't wanna have to like get him you know when i made stronger i did it to compete with timberland and and justin timberlake because my fiance at that time liked justin timberlake just a little bit too much so i made it to compete and then we have the song out it's number one on apple it's blowing up i play it in a club and it sounds muddy it doesn't sound the way sexyback sounded in the club so i go to pharrell williams to to do the drums and it doesn't they it sounds like a different record and so it can't be a different record because i'm like i'm gonna swap it out on radio right then i go to swiss beats it sounds like a different record i go to timberland the person who did sexyback and he did he did it in five minutes and then spent the rest of the hour talking about how nobody could have done it except for him running around the studio i'm the best no one could have done it that's why he had to go to me he had to go to the king well he he had a point right he had a point right so what makes us so muddy is it the beats it was it was in the drums it was something that timberland had in those drums like now watch this i said i'm going defcon three right and the actual i spelled it wrong i have a tendency to do that i'm not quite john legend tight sweater level spelling b level so i feel a parallel to me going to timberland to when i said hey you as an engineer i need to work with you as an engineer that is jewish to look at these contracts and what my people not just black people let's say artists are dealing with in our contracts these contracts need to be fixed everyone could be so mad at the messenger right yay you said it the wrong way you're offensive you're like hitler now because you said it you said this out loud but it does not you're you weren't getting enough sleep all this shit does not negate the fact that we do have houston we have a problem yeah but we is just the music industry like there's a lot of hate that was created by just saying that you know but you're saying what is just is everything to me right yeah yeah one one it could one person could mean everything to me right and for george bush winning an election was everything and then when you said george bush doesn't care about black people that you woke him up you woke the people up to the fact that he was narrowly being selfish you are there's a sense to which you're being corrupted by your own greatness that you're focusing too much on the industry that you've made great that you've rose to the very top one of the richest artists in history one of the greatest designers i'm not i am the richest artist in history probably the richest artist in history yeah i i don't i you know the funny thing is they're like oh rich is black person like oh also rich is actor rich is musician rich is fashion designer like it's a bunch of riches in that one you know what i'm saying it's like richer than ralph lauren like like richer than armani like richest like of that but still low like because where do you put that you know like on the totem because i don't even want to i bank account isn't everything i would say you and i are equal in a certain deep sense no matter what the bank account says voom voom voom voom so i wanted to give you some theme music for for your moments a little muddy let me give you the timberland version thank you but okay say that at the club so other thing about like say like balenciaga is demna will work with ye someday and for cedric and for francois pinault and salma is is a beautiful human being five years from now you'll hear and know the name yay and know things that we did and balenciaga is not gonna make it onto your questions would you would you as a a gambling man would you bet on that i will bet on that i can see it in your eyes let me ask you a question it it was sad it was actually a sad day for me not for me but more for balenciaga i just when i when i heard that i was just like oh shame let let me ask you a silly question just about them i i read something that you two talked about like buttons for a few hours they're my gumdrop buttons just in that accent me and dim long is speaking shrek what what's your philosophy with which you approach design you're you are one of the great fashion designers of our time how do you think about it do you have a philosophy you know what i like about the zipper is the zipper the zipper hoodie replaces the dress shirt because you could get on your douchebag shit and like unzip it and give a little bit of you know that type of look and which is the douchebag you know like when the when the you know the douchebags that go to vegas unbutton their dress shirt yeah yeah yeah and the problem with the pullover hoodie is you can't do the douche bag thing where you unbutton it but then still get the like the stomach because the thing is the ultimate look would be like you know military tank pullover hoodie and if you get a little hot you take off the hoodie but you're like crazy in shape mhmm so it gives you that flexibility yeah it's giving the zipper's giving some flexibility and it's like maybe you wanna keep your jacket on like it is considered like a hoodie to be like a jacket if you wanna keep your jacket on then you might you might wanna do this as opposed to pulling it all the way off yeah you know so and it's just comfort but then you get okay can i do a jogging pant on this with a last elasticity now people argue about climate where we are with the climate i take responsibility as being the most influential designer yeah of all time to to say we're gonna use biodegradable clothing now the issue there is the elastic is not biodegradable so that means it's actually better to use jeans and a belt than to have an elastic waistband because elastic waistband is not biodegradable so i use the planet as a big the future of the planet is a big piece of the way i engineer and the way we talk about where designs are going the constraints on your design and engineering is given by the planet by the future of the planet yes that could almost make jewish people like me again every time you say jewish people i think i've been maybe reading a little too much about world war two but man i'd recommend you listen to some audiobooks or read some books on the holocaust because like it's heavy it's heavy it will put into context would you impact of your words that read books on the current holocaust that black people are in no i i mean i read i read what have you read about abortion i've read a lot of short form writing and i've listened to a lot of debates because it's really humbling that the the question of when does life begin is a really difficult question for me as an engineer and scientist it's a philosophical question i mean we could just go on population control not like if abortion is right or wrong we could say factually the clinics were made by eugenics for population control and it is controlling the population as is the never being given a forty acres and a mule so you don't have the opportunity and when the people that do have the opportunity are separated from our people our tribe and placed in suburban communities next to as chris rockwell put it the dentist and you know whitewashed and made to shut the fuck up and you know vote left or whatever you know niggas are supposed to do when we make it as opposed to saying okay we're building schools we're building up choirs we're building up our own leagues basketball teams our own factories we we started the first sportswear factory in america since world war two was actually this factory i put in cody so you know i'm forty five years old we're on this journey right now it's the other thing about this it's like people just in general they love me so much i'm like actually a hard guy to really hate for a long period of time just because like because of like my huge cock and that's what i noticed i didn't i didn't understand why you showed it to me when we first met but now i understand yeah it's very nice congratulations i know you don't talk about it but your hat does say twenty four yeah if you run for president what kind of ideas would you represent that we're beings with engineering opportunities i would represent just as you serve the platform here there's something that happened on my last run that i thought i feel i know was brilliant it was noisy but it was brilliant i had one rally and in the rally i just let people come up and i gave them a platform it's our responsibility to listen to the pain and hear the pain and understand even when we're the ones that cause the pain like with my tweet it's my responsibility to hear you and understand why you feel like that but it's our responsibility as a people to understand each other to give people a voice people need the voice and even right now what i'm doing or how god is using me i'm showing where our voices are being muted there is professors that are actually intelligent actually have multiple degrees that have been canceled from their schools and they don't have a music industry or a fan base or shoe design or a smoking hot ex wife to complain about they've just got the truth of what they saw and what they dedicated to this country and to education that has been muted by schools that have been taken over with an agenda and so you're you want the brightest minds to be these professors and then you mute them and they have nowhere to go and you might get a guy now that went from being someone's favorite professor to he's working at starbucks like like he was back at school or like he was back in high school so even if that voice is about anger and hate it still deserves to be heard yeah it deserves to be heard and we deserve to ask why you know like we you have to ask why i just feel like that's what's i feel like that is sympathizer mister hugecock i'm just saying that it just needs to be you should change that to your name on twitter while you're still allowed on there yeah i do you think they got that would get censored i feel like they you know they definitely cut it down some inches the i'm pointing out this truth no i'm sorry this is not a christian thing right and you know i wonder right there when i say these jokes is this something that i because i do feel like laughter is the key engineering and laughter right is the key to peace like when i go get my teeth cleaned and i i have the nitrous there's there's something that i wanna go and hug kris jenner i wanna go and hug corey campbell i wanna go and hug you know howard stern i'm at no one wants to hug howard stern i mean you know but you know just if what no no no no let's i think i would love to see you two hug it out and make up even though all the shit talking back and forth what about talking it out or is he gonna be screaming at me yeah judgmental and that kind of stuff no i hope i hope there's love there you know the thing is i think howard's just jealous you know yeah yeah yeah not not just not just jealous of my cock he's also he's jealous that i started my campaign earlier than him you gotta let go of that jealousy is you gotta let go of that jealousy howard you gotta howard and everybody else jealousy is a natural human thing man i wonder just as a christian right when i joke and say this stuff i it's like am i being disobedient to god because as a boss right i'll talk to an an employee and i'll be like why didn't you just listen because i've got the bigger plan right so it's like me talking to god were there things that i did in this interview that were disobedient to god and and for those things i i pray and i repent for anything that i've said that was disobedient to god or humor is not one of them jokings i feel like humor is the way we avoid so much suffering in the world it's the way to it it's like a catalyst yeah for love like it's a way to people that have gone through some of the darkest trauma that i've ever met through the war i just came back from ukraine they're laughing they're they're making jokes that's the best way to deal with dark times i don't know what it is about like humans i i feel like humor that's the best way to socially engineer a good future i think is humor not taking shit too seriously that's the problem with censorship one of the things that really suffer is humor jokes maybe going too far in the jokes you mentioned anthony jeselnik that guy goes hard that guy goes really hard and it's great mhmm he crosses all cut he crosses all the lines and he's that's why he's a genius and that's what people feels refreshing when he does it i don't know what it is but then it's like hurtful when i do it but i tell you something that was interesting i'm pretty sure anthony doesn't like sorry for the assumption but just most comedians i know didn't vote for trump that's interesting i not saying there aren't comedians that did but just the ones i know because i live in california right but they have an appreciation for trump because of the sense of humor yeah had i asked you about parlor engine engineering because i'm interested about that doom doom doom hey man i'm actually trying to hold it together you're pretty you're pretty offensive towards towards a lot and i'm not looking to be offensive i really wanna bring people together and get these stuff done but the word i a hundred percent i see your vision how do we do that somebody you care well not don't say jewish media and jewish jewish controlled media jm like man you sound you sound like it it sounds too much like nineteen thirties nazi germany that was leading up to the atrocities oh he he would say jm yeah he was branded jm that's right no it's just the the the implied like this memeified prejudice towards a group in a way that's going to lead to hate and i i know you don't mean that i know i know you have love in your heart you know what's the you know what's the prejudice towards a group that led to hate blm blm took a black person showed his death on camera because okay there are examples of us being killed and being killed on camera but if it was spread on camera it was done on purpose by the media because fourteen twenty kids get killed in chicago every week and it's not spread that much they like you said singled out a person directed everything on that person right as the martyr and raised the people that hadn't had any we didn't have our forty acres and a mule we didn't have you know like a lot of things right like that black people have not ever been given so once we've given just a little bit like your life matters right then we literally like oh okay now we're being hurt right but actually the death toll is up the city where this happened is completely been turned to a war zone they actually it's actually something like candace owens can actually specify this better but it's like its own city or something like they they made it not be a part of the actual state or something it's like like dc and stuff it's like it's like washington dc now and stuff like and that has to be from a government you know that's got higher level agenda written all over it yeah they're using the death of an individual yeah sure the media are not the jewish media the media and that's the media is fucked up that machine does takes whatever tragedy and pushes it towards whatever narrative that gets more clicks and views and so on sure and then politicians do the same they use the media they influence the media to tell a story and i this is a simple thing i put i believe that the idea of antisemitism and the the closeness of the holocaust is used by certain individuals in media to not take accountability for the bad things that that are happening and what's happened is there's a new frontier right meaning like it used to be okay for somebody to be a billionaire we thought about a billion a billionaire right you a lot of times you think i'm actually kinda being out of shape and you know twenty years ago thirty years ago like onassis or something like you thought about it a different way now you think about it but you think about elon you think kim you think yay you think it's a new kind of billionaire you know it's not just soros who's a billionaire it's a new form of billionaire well right now what i'm calling for the industry is i'm i'm calling i'm calling the industry out and saying like hey it just so happens that there's been times where i had my lawyer was jewish my regulator was jewish but like like eight people that basically would collude and talk without me were in groups saying okay this is what the tour is gonna be this is his next house and they were making all these decisions and they were making all this money and at the end i was like i ended my tour and i don't have the money and it just so happens that that's the case that what they were but what i'm saying is if everyone can say hey you can't point out this fact or we're gonna say you're antisemitic and we're gonna call you hitler i feel that there has to be at least one percent of safeguarding the ability to screw the artist based on saying it's anti semitic by pointing out that they just so happen to all be jewish and i don't think that's antisemitism i just think that's hey this is another thing like okay the kardashians when you hear that do you think male or do you think female you think female you get what i'm saying you think this is the realities this is why rap works right they're gonna make a anti women thing in a in a second right and it's gonna say well if you point out that these five women six women are having a meeting on where the christmas party is and none of the ballplayers or rappers that they have babies with have any say so so that christmas happened at courtney's house all eight years when i was there and it never happened at anyone else's black family house right if i'm the one that pointed it out they just don't have they they don't have their oh you're antisemitic word to say shut the fuck up yeah but because this is the way it runs and this is the way we wanna do it you say that though that women are silencing the black voice yes you're gonna get the same response but especially if it historically resonates the fact that it's true when you talk in groups that breeds hate when you talk about individuals it solves problems and this you're an inch engineering okay but this is something i pointed out on pierce i said if a black person gets pulled over with a car and it's three other people in the car they're also going to jail they're not going to single them out they're gonna say you guys are all in collusion i just described collusion five times in this interview and you keep on going back to this is like nineteen thirty this is like this this is like that what i'm saying is look i want to work with you as an engineer to free my people can we start as a being with engineer opportunities right here i i am sorry to the people who had to be hurt and affected by that now we are here and i'm looking to solve it but what happens is every time if i talk to any of these business people one by one because mind you i didn't get to the tweet by not having a conversation i had the conversations beforehand before i got to the tweet now we're gonna take it to the stage now we're on the world stage right and you saw ari emanuel do exactly the kind of thing that i was saying had been done behind closed doors now he's doing it in open doors they told candace owens i couldn't be on the daily wire like you can't even explain yourself and we don't care have how you got to that point either and that's fucked up they told candace you can't be on daily life even about yes she did that's what they said and you know what and you can have my voice raised or lower i'm a do it lower right because what's happening to me by i put in your words the media is saying not only can you not explain yourself we don't care how you got to that point you need to apologize and you can't explain and that's the end of the story so just apologize so we can have mel gibson do some more films it's exactly what ari emanuel was saying no one is looking to change the problem that led so many people to that same level of frustration and i just so happen to be the one that's not gonna back up on it until this changes because you know what i'm sorry i had a sleepy text i'm sorry i wrote i'm sorry for every i'm sorry that i i put that i was five twelve or five eleven on tinder okay my cock is not fourteen inches i lied okay it's only thirteen yeah so i'm sorry right yeah so the he's dropping so many facts today so what i'm saying is but where do we get to this because even you as engineering as intelligent as you are you just like everyone else that i say was colluding won't let us get to the point of fixing it yeah but i'm not i think you're more powerful than the media i'm not saying you need to apologize because the media i'm saying everything we've been talking about just because i care for you and i want you to be the best possible man you can be to me a definition of a gray man i'm with martin luther king on this you don't talk about jews or or black people you talk about engineering you talk about humanity you solve problems you identify the problems in the world and you don't come from a place of resentment this group did this this fuck all that that is in the past you just build solutions i'm gonna create a new record label i'm gonna create a new design firm i'm gonna create a new social network i'm gonna do it better i'm gonna do it right i'm gonna do it right by the people that i know don't have a voice i'm gonna give them a voice and talk about that is it okay to call out collusion do people collude in your business under you like the engineers they come together and like say they collude against the bosses right you know why bernard arnault offered the deal and took it away from me collusion because i was too powerful with the collective that i had right there he had to stop that at all costs they said for whatever reason this kid yay it has the ability to have all of the kardashians jay z and beyonce justin bieber demna virgil dah dah all these people in the same room working towards a same goal i've been that person since preschool that's called a leader right and right now what i'm saying is hey for the people in business whatever their background is whether it turn their whether they turn their cell phones off on friday or not there's been some bad business done there's some bad business practices and we have to change that because this game is like boxing more people end up retarded than rich and i'm saying like beat to a pulp driven crazy beat by the media to a pulp right now the media has done everything they could to make me apologize and to make me look crazy and that one person has done anything to find out why i was frustrated enough to do that tweet and that's facts and that's fucked up well i i was hoping to i am finding out we found out i mean but like i want solutions like see there's something about human nature where if you focus too much on resentment totally focusing on anymore fuck the resentment we're moving forward right so there there's two things i think that are required for i mean this is how i've lived my life for great engineering you surround yourself in your personal life by people you trust and then in your professional life from the engineering perspective with the team with an incredible team and everything else doesn't matter that allows you not to focus on other groups how they're fucking you over how they're like trying to manipulate or collude and all that kind of stuff you focus on solutions and you find a way around all the difficult shit that's it if you have people in your life you can trust that's like lifelong you said like some people you're with for the summer for a year find people you can be with for your whole life do you have people in your life that you trust like really trust no i trust god at any point a human being can like i could like if i like go and like really you know treat this guy like a piece of shit or do this am i supposed to you know trust him to be loyal and stay in the situation no i trust people to be people and people are flawed and people can have the right intentions but it only makes sense for us to work together when our agendas align when kim was pulled really far to to to the left our agenda's no longer you know aligned so that made the marriage impossible it it aligned where it's like oh i could wear a red hat that can help her get alice johnson out of jail because trump's willing to do that for my wife because i was the only person in my position that stood up and said waste it i like you you know because but isn't there a deeper agenda the human agenda of just being in love like that's just pot what you're talking about red hat is just politics right i mean the world is becoming more and more transactional every day and actually marriages were actually actually originally based on transactions you know and that's why they're less needed the more autonomous as we come or the world makes it less needed i feel like we do need each other i feel like we do need someone we can always you know count on it's like i'm yay pulled away by king koopa which is the media the politics the promise oh we're gonna keep you safe so the thing the reason why i get you know really frustrated with kris jenner is she says losing rob kardashian was the greatest mistake of her life but she never gave kim's hand over in marriage because this is the bottom line when me and kim met we were millionaires or whatever right you're telling me you just hand her hand over in marriage that your daughter's not successful handing your hand over a marriage to but no she had to still be the husband to all of her daughters and we see what the results are consistently so that's where i get you know frustrated it's like let that go let this person do what you made mistakes on don't make this person relive those same mistakes and then put that agenda into my daughters too is there somebody in your life close to you that that you trust enough to call you out on your bullshit we're all full of shit sometimes what's my bullshit well some of it i pointed out today but i don't know you deeply enough what was the bullshit media jewish that's not bullshit the bullshit is that the jewish media won't admit your dad was right your dad was right the words you used the you weren't the point you said it you're not gonna maybe say it eight hundred more times i don't know if it resonated because you keep saying like the words did it resonate to y'all that y'all ain't do nothing about it and that all y'all wanna do is have somebody apologize or sweep under the rug your bullshit that you've been doing the whole time you you on the same bullshit as the other people so you're doing the same thing that the other let's say media because i'm not allowed to say has done so until somebody which is what man is just what is i'm trying to call you out in your bullshit because i hope i'm somebody you can trust i don't fucking trust you well you should find people in your life you can trust don't tell me what i should do i'm not one of your blm marchers listen i'm with you on the blm a lot of organizations use tragedy it it and and i watched the candace owens documentary and what what was your take on it i think it's important to question the mainstream narratives but i don't agree with it i still believe that george floyd died from the knee of the cop not from fentanyl and and even if that was the case there's still fifty percent of black deaths is actually abortion so let's get into engineering let's just go because that's some how do you fix that population control is social engineering and and it's most literal form the blacks that are under population control that's something that i mean that's just what it is african americans are not choosing to get the abortion i mean it's a choice it's an individual choice but we're being influenced too well then speak to the community and help i mean i don't know what the engineering solutions there are it could be i you're doing that in part by speaking to the value and the power of family well well watch this i was building shelters i bought land in calabasas i bought two ranches in wyoming three hundred acres in calabasas twelve thousand acres in total in wyoming and i started building ideas for shelters and god set it on my heart to make monasteries which would be modern day facility facilities that don't turn people down that have farms that have shelter clothing but first of all water first of all knowledge because knowledge is the most important resource to our species above water knowledge it's itself because then you can go get water i mean you could argue like if you're a baby how do you eat water but but the baby doesn't have it you know so someone with the knowledge then feeds the baby the water but it's important that those with the knowledge teach the baby how to find the water themselves and the business people that i've been dealing with have been keeping the baby sick by not sharing the information and the knowledge with inside of those contracts my people are sick if i load up apple music right now and i play the top songs in the rap chart i would tell you my people are sick if i go to the restaurants and opportunity zones and we look at the calorie rating and the cholesterol i would tell you that my people are sick if we look at the obesity rate if you go to just a a a restaurant somewhere in in middle america denny's or something i went to denny's the other day you will see that my people are sick and my people meaning all people right but black people are very influential to all people so right if so if the media picks a overweight black woman and says this is body goals then the media are influencing my people to stay sick and it just so happens that that night i was so frustrated after twenty years that i had to call it out in one tweet that now even if i say hey okay i was frustrated for these reasons now it's not good enough you've literally tried to make me re apologize ten times in this meeting re say this re say that but it doesn't change the fact that my people are sick and i'm the only person in my position that will say that my people are sick today not thirty years ago not sixty years my people are sick today fifty percent of my peoples of deaths are abortion today my people don't have the opportunities today even to the point that because if jpmorgan had been nice to me and if alex klein a stem player had been fair to me different things then i wouldn't even point it out that we don't have any black we have two black engineers so i have to have a responsibility obviously to all people but specifically to my tribe because tribes tribes move you know tribalism is real with black people to separate the brightest from the tribe or to separate the leaders it is factual that the cia removed the leaders from the black community put crack in the communities put guns in the communities and locked up all the leaders and called them gang leader right locked up all the leaders locked up all the fathers now seventy two percent of black mothers are raising children by themselves this is agenda like a tuskegee experiment set on my people right and what i'm calling out for the black people in entertainment is what are we doing we have to collude and if we don't collude because even if i said hey i'd like to make a company that's all black right is that okay for me to say is that okay for me to say or is that antisemitic see if i hadn't crossed the line so far then that would have sounded anti semitic now i've stretched a bit so now we can go to okay let's make an all black company but that would have been antisemitic just that concept because you could word that in a different way that would sound antisemitic i don't know man i i have to get no no listen what if you were if i said i didn't wanna have the jewish people in the company would that be antisemitic it would sound like it right you'd say i'm from nineteen thirties right yeah but for me as a tribe to say no i want an all black company right i'm generally against that kind of thing but you first of all you have the right to do whatever the hell you want to cement that saying is that's what i feel may need to happen for my people to have power again because when my people have been left under the media's control we've been made sick we've been allowed to be sick we've been promote and we're promoting sickness i think at least in the engineering realm i haven't met an engineer who happens to be black who would like to be called a black engineer and when you have a company of all black people that are engineers i don't know the creative arts i apologize but engineering they really try to look at each other as humans and look at the problem and you want to know you want to have the confidence that everybody on the team is the best possible person for the job what i can say is the world is sick and i have slight images of utopia slight images of happiness slight images as a visionary and a creator and i know for a fact the way that business deals have been done for me are keeping the world sick fix them i see that's what you're trying to do and you probably listen people should not doubt yay but i gotta tell you i have to be honest i don't this is silly because you don't know me but it it hurt when you say you don't trust me you kinda lost me i don't think anyone's ever said that to me i don't know man fuck that you know i'm not i don't care about views or clickbait or any of that bullshit i just thought you're one of the great greatest artists ever it'd be cool to talk to you and i just i feel like you got pain you're working through i never had anyone say that to me i i maybe i'm just being a mess about it i guess that's fucked up though but maybe it's not maybe you shouldn't trust it but but i just haven't had that experience i yeah do you think i would trust anybody at this point in my life yeah it's tough it's tough it's tough i hear you and i it's it's also kind of good to see how much strength you got you're not broken by any of this you're under a lot of attack a lot of attack by a lot of people you have a vision and you're trying to feel your way through it and you might get destroyed for it that's the human that's the risk you take it's a wonderful life though what do you hope your legacy is to be forgotten you think you'd be forgotten because the memory there's ego and memory in the memories who designed the sidewalk who designed the water fountain who designed the stop sign who designed the stoplight these things are so ubiquitous that the person that designed them is forgotten if it's a good idea it's a god idea and i don't know vcs can own it so you want your designs in all rounds of life to be so simple that they they permeate everything they take over and you're forgotten that that's a successful design is you're forgotten yes do you have advice for people a lot a lot a lot of young people look up to you do you have advice for young people of how to live a life they can be proud of don't tweet while you're sleepy take a nap surely there's other things i i love the humor don't take it seriously i suppose is what that means no no send sleepy tweets unless you buy your own social platform the very next week call parler but other than that if you're not gonna buy your own social plat then don't is that why you bought parlers so you could be sleepy and send messages out into the wild i actually am really interested in the engineering aspects of parlor is there a vision there because i'm also super interested in elon buying twitter i like instagram better than twitter and i'm sure mark zuckerberg liked instagram better than facebook or saw how you know how valuable that was and he bought it so you'd like to take parler or something whatever is the magic that makes instagram work you wanna push it there i thought it was interesting how it felt like snapchat made the kardashians bully instagram what what's the what's the point of snapchat going to war on instagram yeah i mean just everyone wants to say well this is our value snapchat you know no one wants to lose their value to someone else's value whatever it's like and everything is just what's the difference between permanent and temporary you know it's just a permanent structure and until god says it's not you know it's like nothing's permanent our life is not permanent so how do we just let go of those things even like going from the name kanye westieier was the beginning of just letting go of some things of these titles like we need to remove the titles like hey if i if i have to leave adidas and i have to go next computers that may take me out of the billionaire standing altogether and i i gotta get low for however long god says i have to get low and refocus i've been reshaping refocusing my staff i had some people that were good and i had some people that weren't i had too many people and i've got a vision inside of me and i'm like this is how i make this vision i have to bring this vision to life i have to bring these houses to life i was talking to one of our architects on you know we're actually getting close on it i've like built it a few times i had like the domes you probably saw and kinda and i said you know how he transformed kim's house and you know we're getting there like so you won't get into architecture like you really you really want this to be become physical reality yes and i've i've got close rome wasn't built to today yeah but rome had to start somewhere yeah i gotta call you out on the advice there really is a lot of people that look up to you and you've lived a really difficult life and you made it through all of it what what what do you advise them to do do everything that you feel even if you are told that it's the wrong thing no no no no no but not anything violent so do what you feel say what you feel like trust your heart yeah trust your gut trust your instincts because that instinct is who god made you to be not you know what lines up with your like frat brothers or what lines up with what your dad wanted or what lines up with your classmates or you know it's just god has something inside of you and and when you walk down the street you're thinking about it and then you just see it in the window and you go down another street you see the same thing or you're thinking about a number and that number pops up or you see it on a license plate and that's just you know something is trying to say be the maximum yay you know be the maximum you and god won't give you anything that you can't handle so for me everything is a yes i think they say be like water i know bruce lee said that or matter of fact just be because we are beings with engineering opportunities beautifully put yay i have hope i have faith that however this turns out that you have the skill and the capacity to really add love to the world and i hope you do that i really really hope you do that and we talked about the tension of that the challenges and the opportunities of that i mean i see how we could be of use to each other you actually have a particular thing for me as i eject from media because even also you know i'm really big at like you know burning the phoenix too all you know as an engineer that your cells completely regenerate every seven years i think i i rush the process a little bit so i i run around looking like a burn victim sometimes yeah but i gotta tell you anyone i am close with i work with there has to be trust there has to be love and i think you've been burned quite a bit in your life sometimes i did it myself i put my hand on stuff so how do we get to engineering there's a deal to be done here not saying you're making this money off of that i'm making that money off but there's i don't care about money by the way same twins so there's dealings here you got pain i got pain but we're beings with engineering opportunities for a long time i thought somebody should create a new social network and it looks like great engineering could do that you got two at one time from two of your homeboys at one time yeah and that's a great way i mean every you know it can be done from scratch or it can be done anew with an already established platform yeah i'm very excited by that possibility parler is smaller twitter is larger i wonder whether you can do any kind of revolutionary engineering with a large company if anyone can i would say it's elon well elon can look at what we do over here that's why i like god does this a lot of times he creates doppelgangers there's a lot of examples where theory happened two places at one time a really similar type of personality happens at one time it's weird it's beautiful yeah it's hilarious actually yeah it's kinda humorous so we should we should just share every piece of information together as like as i go build parler and as he builds up twitter and see how to make both those better but i'll i'll be like hey i'm not gonna let snapchat bully me out of you know adding something to it that's best it should just be the best platform possible yes that means that you know that means tiktok has amazing features twitter has amazing things about it i i know this girl that's like i like instagram better than twitter it's just she likes that twitter has porn but other than that instagram but i was like well instagram is porn also it's like soft it's more subtle it's not telling you it's not it's not conservative by any means you know and i mean that's the thing you have to please a lot of people with these platforms and i think the goal of a platform should be to help individuals maximize their long term happiness and growth like intellectually spiritually psychologically all of that and it's a tricky thing to figure out how to do that of course you could just have a platform that's just strictly for fun i think that's where tiktok leans but there has i think there's a balance to strike like twitter there's a lot of intellectual philosophical stuff going on on twitter but it somehow currently makes it too easy to be divisive and hateful towards each other and cancel and all that kind of stuff i think we need to have these healthy conversations that's what it is healthy conversations healthy dialogues that's the biggest thing like when i first wore the red hat the conversation is less healthy than it is today the conversation about george floyd you know it's like did i send the tweet the right way did is katniss owens' documentary perfect is what michael moore is that documentary is perfect century self is it fully accurate you know it's two to three hours of a transmit of information through a particular usually one person's view and anything you want to research if you're interested in it you gotta look at ten versions of it twenty versions of it george floyd we've looked at one version of that now we have a second well by the time we get to the you know i know this is like it's it's not my last hoodie but it's definitely not my first hoodie that i put on you know it's like that's how we got to it like even this particular size of zipper or the fact that you know for people who know they know that that's like carhartt even though the carhartt tag isn't there anymore you just know by the shape of it you feel it so it it abstracts it takes into like this cubist place like picasso and matisse or african cubism or dire straits money for nothing and your chicks for free look at that yeah i wouldn't think you could reference dire straits look at you that video yeah i know it's a great video that video is like sexy knowledge of music is great i think that you know porn is not just sexual that term actually relates to torture like you know what i'm saying like watching people beat each other up on on worldstar or something you know it's like that's called torture porn there's also food porn how do you explain that what's food porn food porn is like looking at really delicious cakes and cookies and steak and so on and you're like holy shit exactly architecture like there's people who love architecture when they see architecture i know i got friends that'll be like oh that's porn yeah architecture yeah yeah it's like that's like love like dopamine fueled love for a thing yeah we need that's beautiful i think that's beautiful well i think as long as no nobody's getting hurt the intoxication that people have you know the worst part is like when one person's in love and the other person's in like that's us right now well who's in like no because you said you love bill maher and you like me not and and i love you so that was that was no i i actually love you both alright alright and the funny thing is like as a as a visionary visionaries are more extreme than business people because a visionary would do bad business for their vision mhmm a businessperson will never do bad business it's well put yeah it's really well put so when you say i don't care about money it's like yeah i i feel you like i feel that i care in a way that i need that but i care about the vision that i have to a steve jobs level to the point of putting that above my regular human existence meaning having to go and take all the arrows that i become a soldier of the vision because someone could say a wife could say to like say like in the sixties their husband's about to go to war the the wife may not want their husband to go to war because of their children but he's going to war because of their children definitely do you regret any aspect of just giving everything to your vision i mean you've spoken about that saying like i got fucked over in the business side i promise that i had to stop envying cool people at their current cool time if anything if someone's cool and i say their name a lot i'm gonna flash the light on them so much that it ages their coolness it's actually a war technique showered in compliments yeah you know because that that you the to be able to stay at forty five years old to still be the bad kid in class at forty five i'm still in the principal's office because if you look at like say fashion right if you think of something fashionable it's probably gonna look like the kid in the principal's office that's gonna be the fashion and that's part of the reason why i'm the most influential person at fashion and fashion because i refuse to leave the principal's office if the substitute teacher comes in i'm gonna say you got a big butt yeah i'm gonna get and they're gonna right back right back to the principal's office and people gonna be like yo and that's what you keep on saying like who can we talk to because no one can talk to me no one i'm out of control bro it's just god then me and then fuck everybody you know what i mean that's how i that's really how i live my life and i would just wanna say this one thing about the children thing i wanted to you know put that point together put that idea together i don't like the word point i'm really big on like words words being powerful says the person with the sleepy tweet yeah so you're full of contradictions yeah i'm a human being right it's like some days i'm like i so i could go thirty days to be celibate you know like really like i'm a monk i'm being like faithful to god and then i'll go like working out no carbs like my work weight will fluctuate and i'll have times i'm like i don't feel like being told what to do so i don't wanna work out with a trainer and i just wanna drink this hennessy but i wanna say this thing that i will text to kim sometimes i'll say you know you may not understand what i'm doing right now but you will and that's what i would say to everyone you may not understand what i'm doing and this gives a little bit maybe we're like twenty percent there but there's still gonna be people who'd leave this interview and they were like i still don't like the way he apologized i still don't wanna say what my involvement would have been to make him lead him to that point and we just want things to be how they are there's people in the world who want the world to stay as it is and there's people who want to change the world and that's happened throughout time they say that with da vinci halfway into a conversation he could not suffer fools so much that he would walk away halfway into the conversation and i said well that's why it's the davinci code and not the davinci world and every time i go and piss off a group of people or do these things on some end it's like i could be turning my thing from a potential world vision to a code or i could be opening up conversations with new friends that i may trust someday yeah that's beautiful that's beautiful that that because the change you will have on the world that you don't know for sure but it'll happen across years even decades so you have to think in the future like you're working in the future your actions are working in the future and a lot of people will judge this conversation and others you've done and so on in the present and that doesn't matter you know why i apologize when i say i'm sorry to the jewish people that i hurt it's not about like i said oh i said i'm not gonna hold this apology hostage right it's obviously it's about god but god is everything right so what's the point of having language and being you can't engineer if you say god god god right it's like it's god asks us to be judgmental so that you become if you're a doctor right it's your judgment that saves grandma right and god puts that in this like we have god inside us we're a piece of god also right so i'm gonna go specific to a person that story about da vinci alone is enough of a reason for me to give a sincere apology to the jewish people because i do believe that there's a da vinci code inside of all of my misspellings and scribbles right here that god wants me to get to the world and when i'm in my way if god has set something on me when i'm in my way i'm in god's way now i can point at other people and say hey you guys are in god's way because you're not listening to me but if i'm in my way i'm not listening to god and for me to be a philosopher and a leader whatever other language i have to listen to god so before god what i would do is start off as a samurai and say i'm sorry for hurting you as a jewish person i'm sorry for the way that made you feel and i'm sorry for the entire population of a race that that i feel is actually my brothers because i classify and feel that i'm also connected with christ in that way that my people came from africa in that way and i can't say it's this exact teaching or that exact teaching but i feel that there's an important you know the sons of abraham however we wanna word it right for us to come together and bring our different talents together to serve god collectively and he as much of a alien as i am he does not cause me he did not call for me to alienate and that's what the problem has been especially in politics and in america he placed america as the tv as the radio to the world we invented rock and roll right we are the influencers of the rest of the planet we're the we're the youngest startup in history right we're the youngest country we're the we're the youngest superpower right so for me in my position the fact that i can talk to trump one day and be at a game with kim kardashian the next day and then be at paris fashion week they don't want me to be involved with language of decisive divisive language you know proving that i can be just as racist as a racist white person oh i can i can be a racist black person also that's not what god has called me to do so how do i simplify and say hey to you as a visionary as a as an engineer as a person that's given me a platform that as my brother i wanna apologize to you for how that made you feel and to the rest of the people that carry specifically that pain not the pain that i talk about that doesn't seem to be as much of a pain for people when i talk about the abortion clinics and stuff that's it's like that's a argued pain even in my own community like not everyone thinks that's a pain but for the jewish community it's collectively this was a pain and i've gone i've gone so far just psychologically on this journey since that statement had happened where i didn't want to like give up the candy in my pocket i didn't want to say hey i stuck my can my hand in a candy jar i wanted to defend my freedom of speech i wanted this but even with freedom of speech pain is pain causing people to hurt is not helping causing people to hurt is not helping so that means i have to take a a more sophisticated approach to engineering this problem this problem is an opportunity and yes that what could some people may deem as a mistake would it be more genuine if i called it a mistake i think i would be hypocritical by calling it a mistake with with the ending of that the idea i'm gonna say out loud so i'm not i don't try to be a hypocrite on purpose so but i will call it a mistake to add a genuine to be genuine about the feeling with that mistake with me as a human being not to justify but i have to state that god makes no mistakes because if i hadn't made that mistake i wouldn't be in front of you today and that's not to justify this sleepy text but i can tell you're a man that has love in his heart and i hear that i hear it through the words explicitly and implicitly and i i think if we're to engineer a better future the way to do that is with love so as one human to another i love you brother thank you for talking today this is great i like you too son of a bitch thanks for listening to this conversation with ye formerly known as kanye west to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from ye himself nothing in life is promised except death thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
