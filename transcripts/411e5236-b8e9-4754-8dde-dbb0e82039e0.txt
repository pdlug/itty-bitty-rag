heard you say that you've been trying to kill her but she keeps using the kids as human shields so have you considered negotiating a ceasefire well the thing is every day every minute of the day in a married life is a negotiation everything can blow up into a full scale war starting from a simple sentence like good morning what should we do with the kids today what should we do with that piece of furniture any sentence can lead you to heaven or to hell in the same time so you do negotiate with terrorists oh yeah yeah hundred percent yeah and for her i am her terrorist too so it's equal terrorist on both sides on a more serious note when you found out about the attacks of october seventh what went through your mind if i'm allowed to use a curse word i said i i was like as many as possible i was like oh shit part of my stand up comedy is i describe a situation where i was in a restaurant with producers and there was a bombing two blocks away in chelsea new york in two thousand sixteen and of course this is the like damn what's gonna happen to us now and and and there's like two different reactions there's the the white reaction which is like oh my god i hope nobody is hurt this is terrible i hope everybody is okay and there's the arab reaction what's his name what's his his name what is the name you know because you know what's gonna come it's kinda it's i was scared what's gonna really happen in that area and it's like oh my god it's gonna be horrible and the way that it was reported i i didn't know how to handle this so i basically i went into hiding for a few days three four days and i talked about piers morgan team talking to me two times three times i was like no i can't how can i defend that how can you defend the rape the decapitated babies or whatever and then i started kind of looking in the news a little bit and then i started seeing people coming on the shows and saying things that i know as an arab as a muslim as someone from that region that it's not true but i didn't know how to what to say how to say it so i said by the third time when they asked me i said like fine put me on and i went there it was more of a figuratively speaking a suicide mission and because it's a lose lose situation i can i can lose stuff in hollywood i can i i even i remember my manager is like besson be careful i mean are you sure you wanna do it are you my manager just was like please don't do it please don't do it and on the other side if i don't perform well whatever well means i'm gonna be rejected by my own people so it's a it was a lose lose situation because whatever i say it will never be enough and whatever i say will not be good enough and i was going into there and i i felt that i was going into a trance for the thirty three minutes that i was on the on that interview for the first time you blacked out i blacked out i blacked out and a lot of people ask me is the earpiece was dead a bit when the earpiece kept falling it's like no it was really falling off and it disconnected and i had to save it because i cannot see them all i can hear i can just hear them and i could expecting at any time okay bassem thank you i was like i i i was fighting for every second to say words to put stuff in there yeah for people who don't know this is your conversation interview with piers morgan and you can see i can see i was just like the lens of the camera and i feel just like a a real dream or nightmare yeah hello i was like hello i was like hi and it and it could end at any moment your career and everything everything yeah yeah so what was the drive that got you to actually do it to overcome that fear multiple things first of all i don't wanna say it's just my wife's family because my wife's family has always been there but this time was different the the the bombing the attack they they usually one of those people that they're away of everything when that whatever happened in gaza they are always in safe places but this time it seems that there was no place safe and already we heard about like two three of the of the cousins and the uncles already lost their home so this was too much so i i i wanted to say something for those people because i know that you know i i made i made one of the jokes that i made about like oh you know it's hassan her cousin he's a loser he's a doctor he's a doctor and he every time a a a hospital was bombed we were worried about him so i wanted to say that because i felt that these are this is a family that i have never seen in my life i've never she she actually hardly saw an uncle or two because you know they cannot leave but i i said like i need to speak at least i do something for those extended family that i have never known but also because when when piers morgan team called me a couple of times and said okay let's let's see what's going on in the show and i just watched the stuff and the lies and the one-sided reporting that made my blood boil and then i thought like what why am i what am i afraid of i'm afraid of if i say something i can lose my career it's like wait a minute but that was the reason why i left egypt i said wait i left i came to united states i came to the land of the free where i can say anything i want and yet i have limitation of what to say i mean i thought we left that shit behind i mean what's happening and i understand i understand the connection of of like how sensitive it is when you you speak about israel and all of the ready made accusations but as an arab as a muslim i don't react the same when you talk about saudi arabia or iran or egypt or or any of them it's like hey you you want you wanna this some of these countries i'll i'll do that with you because i have strong opinions about what i'm and i already been expressing them but when i talk well that's why i and i speak and there's a lot of jewish people who come to my show and they understand that they understand the separation but that kind of a grouping of blackmailing people and saying and not saying what they have in their mind it is that kind of like one of the things that kind of like put pushed me to go on the show the thing that was bothering you was it what was being said or how it was being said both because they are lies which is usually in the media but there was the total disregard of humanity you talk a lot about in your show about human suffering and i felt that here the human suffering was not equal i felt that's why i came up with this like what's the exchange rate today what's the exchange rate today there's there's of course it's terrible to see anybody die but but but i feel that like is it isn't our life not worth anything yeah you had a chart akin to crypto yeah from an invest you analyze it from an investing perspective of course in the dark side on the car and you were saying that a certain year was a good year yeah it was a fourteen two thousand fourteen was a good year for investment purposes and also to to refer to the to a family member that you called a loser you were saying that you you called him had a conversation with him and he keeps saying that he's not using anybody for human shields and then you called him a loser what do you you gave him a job liar he lied to us because i have to believe but this is what the one thing is like it's also one of the things like how it was said it was stuff that i've been hearing i don't know what what turned on on my head but it's not that i've been hearing all my life from the media israel warns civilians before bombing them and that's okay but that's not okay israel is trying to minimize its civilians but killing them anyway and that's okay but that's not okay so it is kind of like the indoctrination that we've been hearing as if it is okay and then suddenly it's not yeah there's a kind of several layers of bullshit almost sometimes hiding the obvious horror of the situation with kind of politeness and all this kind of stuff just the basic value of human life that said it's a difficult situation it is it is what would you do if you were israel bb called you blossom big fan big fan of your comedy mhmm first of all would you hang up right away would you hear him out no i'll definitely hear him out i was like that was like wait a minute that's material that's material that's material man i was like so netanyahu called me yeah well i was sitting with my family just like having my phone ring like oh netanyahu yeah it just shows up that way i mean what would you do what would you do in this situation to answer this question we need to understand how israel thinks there is an incredible speech given by gideon levy the famous israeli reporter in hayahertz and he describes a situation where he was in the west bank and there was a checkpoint and in that checkpoint there was an ambulance with a palestinian patient and it was there sitting for an hour and a half not moving and then he went to talk to the soldiers like guys why are you not letting them go i was like let them go and then he told them imagine if he is was your father and the soldiers stood up i was like what these are pigs these are not humans so when you tell me what would you do if israel would do it really needs to we need to ask how does israel look at the palestinian incredible talk by michal meyer he was a holocaust survivor and he said i learned in auschwitz when i was there in the concentration camp that in order for a group a dominant group of people to dehumanize another group they need first to dehumanize themselves and israel looks at palestinians as lesser people as lesser beings as some people who are dispensable and the way that they treat them is that they don't really care about like that's why the the exchange rate thing so for me if i am israel i it will be like what would you do if you're the united states in the time of the native americans they were killing people with the millions when you dehumanize a group of people you really don't care so if i was israel i would do exactly what israel is doing right now because there's no one who's holding me accountable there's no one stopping me and i can get whatever i want throughout my history through violence i think a lot of the things you just said are a tiny bit slightly exaggerated so let me let me try let's see let's try so not everybody in israel of course let's let's look at several groups so people in government idf soldiers and citizens that are neither of those and not everybody of any of those sees palestinians as less than human just some percentage so what percentage is that in your sense it's the people who have the power so it's mostly the focus of your commentary when you say people in israel you really mean the people in power the people having power but but but as much as like i of course i mean the people of power because when i speak about because even when i speak about america i speak about people in power when i speak about egypt i speak the people of power because like i can't really talk about the hundred million people in egypt or the eleven million people in israel of course not there are people who go in and and they demonstrate against netanyahu and they want him out of the government but we have to admit that the israeli society it at a whole have moved quite a bit to the right and has been has been like many extreme and you know what happens when you go to the right or you go to the most extreme the other person go to the most extreme and extremism breeds extremism so thank you for the clarification but like i really meant with the people of power when people criticize the united states for going in iraq of course i'm not criticizing citizens but you made another point which is an interesting point and it's very difficult to see in the heart of people but i wonder if you look at the average palestinian and the average israeli and when they look at the other do they have some hate in their heart well everybody probably has some what is that amount you know when you look at a person that looks different than you how much hate is there it depends on what is the living situation of each person so in the berlin film festival just like a few couple of weeks ago there was an israeli and a palestinian receiving an award together and the israeli director said we're gonna go back to israel he's gonna go to the west bank he will have no rights and i will have full living rights these people managed to work together and be friends and they have empathy to each other now the average palestinian it's a very difficult question because is it the palestinian in the diaspora or the palestinian in gaza or the diaspora in the west bank or the one in the citizen of as a citizen of israel who still have less right than a roman citizen of israel than a jew and it really depends if i am there are people in arabs in israel who are having a great life and there are people arabs who are having a a miserable life but definitely people that live in gaza or in the west bank is kind of like on the lower tier of their living conditions now let's talk about the hate what does that palestinian see with whom is israeli the palestinian see oppression limitation of movement limitation of freedom they have and then when there's something happens you see the full force coming in destroying their home taking away members of his family there would be absolutely no reason for him to love the other the israeli because he you know he doesn't have the power but he lives under his government all he sees is the rockets or whatever but like he sees the reaction and he doesn't see what happened to those and as humans we are selfish we see what really affects us as humans and i cannot even imagine what it would be like to live as a palestinian and i'll i'll not even talk about gaza because everybody talks about gaza but let me give you an example and i'm not gonna talk about the twelve thousand kids killed in gaza let's talk about just like the four weeks in the west bank march fourth amr najjar age ten sitting next to his father shot in a while while he's sitting in a car next to his father by the idf soldiers mohammed zayed thirteen years old march third shot in front of a un school while in the sitting with his friends mohammad ghannim age fifteen march second he shot while standing in front of a storefront during a night raid february twenty third saeed gerdol he was killed by a drone fire february twenty second fadi selman killed while standing in front of the top of a red cross building nihil nihilziad february fourteenth valentine's day killed a shot in the head while leaving school february eleventh mohammed khattoor us citizens killed while being in a parked car and moad shem's february ninth killed right in front of his home because a military car came reversing back to him and then somebody opened the door shot him and leave this is a daily life of people in the west bank what is the the justification that idf provides terrorism terrorism or i don't know i mean the you cannot really say like human shields but they would say like they were throwing rocks there was a guy who went on chris rock and he said like his son a us citizen will kill and they're like they were throwing rocks so we killed them even when they were throwing rocks you kill him but the thing is you see this is how easy for them to get rid of palestinians i mean i love like i i was i had to say i prepared a little bit for the podcast because you are in tech so and i i am ignorant in tech there is a movie called the lab it is directed by an israeli director called yutam feldman and he talks about how the the military industry in israel is very advanced and what is really mind boggling is in that movie he shows how the military tests its weapons in the field in urban areas of palestinians it it it it is it is heartbreaking you know as a doctor there's five stages of trials there is like there is discovery preclinical clinical and then market and then post market evaluation by the fda the fda value approval and then fda post market five just to take a pill and you go in and and he interviews people as like where did you test this they test it in the field so when when you just like when human life is so is so cheap and it is so indispensable it made me it gave me a visceral reaction because you know we assume this has been actually the the the state of humanity humanity have lived and survived and thrived by actually killing each other but there was kind of a we were remotely we were removed from it people in greece didn't know what the alexander the great was doing he was killing a pelagena like we called him the great because but he was killing he was he was conquering he was invading julius caesar all of the greats he would do it but killing was difficult killing had to have some sort you have to be with your enemy then you go back catapults then cannons then a little bit back for and then you're kind of like standing from modi now you're killing people behind the screen with a button with a push of a button you know a lot of people say terrorism they killed you with a knife killed one person with a knife shot you that's terrorism but if you fly a sixty four million dollar f sixteen and you drop off an a eighty four bomb that cost sixteen thousand dollars that's not terrorism because it's remote you're behind the screen so what happened what israel is doing it is removing itself like like america too drones and then when you push someone to be in to they always brag about bombing them to the stone ages what happens when the screens and the all of the obstacles that you have been put between you and those people that you have treated them this way when this is a breach and you come face to face you will come face to face with what you have created yeah there's a lot of interesting things you just said so one is the methodology of killing if you wanna look at some horrific large scale killing people often talk about the holocaust but that's visceral you can look at hollermore by stalin or the murders through starvation by by by churchill in india in churchill in india and the great leap forward by mao yep so starvation is a thing we don't often think of it as murder because it's quiet it's slow and the interesting thing about starvation is that the people don't complain as they're dying because they're exhausted mhmm that's one and the other is the value of human life it does seem that every culture has a unequal valuation of human life mhmm so those two things combined create a complicated military landscape of the world yes but the thing is is that how we would look at technology as the savior as if we talk about how we i disrupt we disrupt we disrupt we disrupt and now if you go you talk about like going to the west bank the people in the west bank walk and they don't see humans they see people shouting them from towers or behind the screens or doing and they have like biometrics that is developed by basel system like that's done by hp or or google and amazon who are like part of project nimbus and and you see indivision developing all of this like metric and surveillance and all of that stuff and then you have like something like the gospel that like people have actually said that the gospel can actually create a target list using ai and give you a green yellow or a red to go oh go ahead and now ai is not just disrupting the market it's disrupting our humanity and it is we became so comfortable like it's like dating apps you know when you when you swipe left and right and that it's like oh right it's it's it becomes so like cheap it's not like meeting someone it's like it's like a lot of fish in the sea same with ai boom five hundred people killed boom they're killed it's so easy it's so easy it's so easy and then it's so far removed from you so when you put these people in this condition you have literally put them in a different universe than yours you are behind in your air conditioned screens like pushing them blowing up a a university it's amazing but then you meet the the what you have done that you meet the frankenstein that you have created and then people are like oh look what they did to us you just gave me this image of a a dating app from hell where leaders are just sitting there and kinda swiping left that's like invade yeah right destroy it's just boring like bed puppet government yeah and then turn off the phone go to sleep yeah so i got you know i traveled to the west bank and i mentioned to you offline that i really loved the people there just yeah i've met a bunch of people like that in in eastern europe where i grew up yeah like the flamboyant the big personalities all of that i also met a person who's in charge of a refugee camp who will shop an idf soldier and i'm not sure the words you said are important as the consequences of the thing that you mentioned which is the deep hate in his eyes mhmm that was didn't feel repairable at all it was pain it was like a foundation of pain and on top of that a hatred and i was like wow this is what you kill you kill one person that's the way you create mhmm because we have kind of like a front row seat to what's happening we we think we're in it but we can't really grasp it i mean people's like oh we're just gonna go in get hamas out and we're gonna get them back in mhmm and also with the people get back in how do you think they would look at you what have you created what have you done my show in egypt was all about propaganda it's all about the use of words words are very important the decapitated babies were not chosen randomly because you see it it plants a certain image in your brain imagine if we're going in what a baby can do it can smile cry and poop that's it there's absolutely no threat so when you tell people forty decapitated babies they are so animalistic they didn't see the babies women raped of course he's an animal to do that and they would go through that and they would what was very frustrating about the conversation is the geish galloping the geish galloping throwing you see the distractions you see what happens like it's like what's the proportion response can israel defend itself do you condemn hamas does israel has the right to exist decapitated babies raped women why don't the arab countries take them why don't the muslim muslims kill muslims look what happened in yemen in syria in iraq like see see how they kind of distract you they throw little things at you so you don't know what to do oh the unn anti semitic october seventh october seventh october seventh october seventh and then suddenly you are distracted and pulled into discussing all of these little things and you're not discussing what's happening right now it is basically stalling giving them time to do what they do so there's there's some degree to the propaganda the so the beheaded babies and all this kind of stuff that is so over the top that it shuts down actual conversation about actual wrongs war crimes on both sides mhmm so it's overstating it to where everyone on social media and everywhere in the press and everywhere is arguing almost become desensitized to actual horrors of death which are more mundane they're not so dramatic because beheaded babies because people baby is short but but decapitated babies there's like a knife blade that goes into the skin the trachea the flesh the spine decapitated that that you can just like he's dead no you go in this is the hate so much hate and you know that's why you have made me laugh at at at the darkest shit you're such a beautiful person your dark humor is just wonderful but but you see this happened to jews before remember blood libel where did the blood libel come from it come from these rumors that jews suck babies' blood this is what they did to them what's in the cup exactly that's a very delicious baby cup delicious baby blood but but this is what you do you you tell people something and it happened with the native americans when they were here the one when they went in and they wipe a whole tribe so and and and and and jewish people one of the like the minorities that were persecuted and had this used against them for a very long time and it is terrible and it's terrifying that it's been used again so i i just did a very lengthy debate on israel and palestine and the really painful thing from that those two historians it was it was deep it was thorough it was fascinating but in constantly asking about sources of hope or solutions there was none there was a there was a sense of like a really dark sense of it's hopeless from both sides it's hopeless so you know i look to you for a for a source of hope for a source of hope do you have is is there any hope here solutions short term long term obama have kind of summarized this beautifully in his book he said the reason why the israeli palestinian conflict is so chronic is one side have so much power and the other side have absolutely no power and that's what one what he say he said like you have israel that basically don't listen to us because they're supported by people who are bigger than the president bigger than administration they know that they can i mean like you oba like netanyahu was a caught on tape many times saying like he's basically like belittling americans like i we we control eighty percent of the population we don't care they this has kind of like nonchalant kind of like we we have them and there's nothing really that compels israel to give up anything because at the end of the day what is compromise compromise is like i give something you give something israel is not giving anything and they project that on you so for example how many times have we heard like oh palestinians were giving like four five six seven fifteen chances and they said no to them and yet when you read the history that's not the case at all like for example in two thou the whole idea about like arafat walked away from oslo that didn't happen and there is an incredible video by you know what's his name joe score scarborough with misha and they were hosting her father brzezinski he was the national security adviser and jos karaboz said like well you know like arafat left the oslo accord and the palestinians and then brzezinski said like this is like embarrassingly shallow he said listen what happened was there was a lot of catches on the oslo court it was very unfair to the palestinians so arafat said like i agree but i need to take it to the arab capitals and what and to and they went to ins and they went to sharm el sheikh they came to egypt and he and hibiarik went to there and then hibiarik left because there was election and he lost it the came and it was destroyed this is one of the re reason why people it is it's kind of like facts don't matter as much as what is the narrative that has been controlled but what what were the biggest barriers to piece there do you do you think it's fundamentally leaders don't want a two state solution or was there nuance small differences that if solved could have led to a two to to say solution i mean there was a maybe there was a certain point when the israeli leaders were more open to compromise but i can't say that because each time israel gives back land it has to be after some use of force the the nineteen seventy three war the intifah the the first and second the the the the the casualties in gaza they never give up land willingly and because of peace because if i have that much military i can do whatever i want why would i give up anything i have that much power why would america or china give everything if they're so powerful and especially if they are have this kind of open ship from the united states so it is it is really about what can push israel to give up something because you are so much stronger than me what could compel you to give up something and this is why the whole thing about like trying to equalize palestinians and the israeli state and government it doesn't make any sense so what is the source of hope you know jon stewart who will talk about it from many angles somebody you admire a friend he proposed a two state solution look look look look to the comedians for hope yes well everybody's talking about the two state solution but israel has said many times on netanyahu and bennett's like there's there's gonna be no state solution the the past is like even even he came in on the on on hard talk it's like yeah maybe in the past we wanted to say solutions but like look every time we give them land they kill us so no state solutions and they are openly saying it that's perhaps rhetoric the rhetoric that is supported by action because look at what they're doing in the the west bank that you said they are cutting it a legal settlement piecemealing it so how is if you have an intention at all to give them anything why do you keep do keep doing this and you've called it a bunch of little gazas yeah it's a nice little picture of what's happening piecemealing it because it is what happened in the past four months the palestinians have been microdosing on it for a very long time little by little little by little and we would shout every time when it get gets too much and then we shut down and then little by little but this time it was hard it was hard to see the blatant oppression and the word said maybe the hamas ministry of health are giving us the bad numbers maybe it's just human shield and i i i laugh there's thirteen thousand babies killed does that mean that there are thirteen thousand military target hiding in their diapers because it is so it doesn't make any sense to kill that and maybe it's just like oh oops this is out of our hands it's hard to know what to do with those numbers i mean i it's just one baby is enough but you know what happens when you hear so many numbers numbers become numbers and you become so desensitized and this is why there's a difference between saying thirteen thousand palestinian kids' death is like mila cohen an israeli baby ten month old she was killed in her crib and this is what we hear from cnn we never hear a story about a palestinian kid that's why thank you for giving me the space for saying the news of the palestinian children that were killed just for four weeks though like it's it's because humans needs context they need depth they need like a three d look at what they can look at but if you just tell them numbers they don't mean anything is there some degree to where both leaderships hamas pa palestinian authority israel all want war like perpetual war to to remain in power there is that's that's an interesting question but i mean let's admit something the arab regimes in the in the area have actually used the problem of palestine in order to stay in power in order to take get excuses to like have this enemy and israel the the israeli government has used that too and maybe the palestinians but but my problem with when going into discussion this is that the the two sides are not equal they're not equal in power they're not equal in influence and they're not equal in international support especially with the united states so palestinians can the people who have made changes in history were the people with power the people who would have the ability to change things and the palestinians cannot really change it what what can they change well is that true though okay with how much support the palestinian people have so just like you said there's a lot of arab states that are that will voice their pro palestinian position in order to distract from their the own corruption and abuses of power in their own countries but you know i don't think if you look globally there's a complete asymmetry of power and public opinion here maybe in the press in the west but if you look globally but do they have the same kind of weapons that the israelis have literally power no there's a major asymmetry mhmm of literal power some money to their leaders does that make any difference i mean and also when you say palestinian authority which authority are you talking about hamas or the palestinian authority who has been kind of a domesticated kind of like a puppy for the palestinian who basically had been an informant for their own on their own people and this is the the thing also that kind of like really pissed me off when i was hearing the thing about this thing like hamas hamas hamas hamas like we have netanyahu on tape confessing that he supported hamas giving money in order to cause factions in the in in between the palestinians so it's just like it doesn't make you just told me this mhmm you just told me this you just told me didn't he help support hamid it's like but hamid is like what i mean to which degree does netanyahu represent the israeli people is a is a is a real question to which point does trump or biden represent the american people and to which degree does hamas represent the palestinian people does none none of these represent it but who have the power in order to make the decisions it really comes down to that well who does have the power are are you you're giving a lot of power to israel yeah but the the arab league what what should hamas do what do you think will hamas do continue doing what a charter says which is trying to destroy israel and the role of the palestinian people is to overthrow hamas and get a more moderate leadership probably and the role of the israeli people is to vote out this right wing government and elect a more moderate leader so that there's a chance at peace with two moderate leaders so before hamas even got to control two thousand six as there was ariel sharon in two thousand and we all know what happened and ariel sharon kind of like had made the came up with this amazing policy of like breaking people's kids' bones in the inter father so barack was also like i mean which one is moderate i mean i think is hamas is a product of what happened i mean we can if if there was no apartheid in in in south africa there will be no nfc there will be no nelson mandela if there were no nazis in in in paris there will be no french resistance and i'm not saying that and and again i'm not i i wouldn't don't wanna be in a put in a position to defend hamas or anybody because you know what that entails but there are those are like hamas again not defending them they went into october seventh what was their what what they why why did they did that like release our hostages the people in prison because if you talk about people who were kidnapped israel kidnaps people every single day and when they had the the first exchange in november fourth israel released four hundred people three quarters of them were women and children why are those people in prison there's one in four kids that are imprisoned that stay in solitary confinement which is by international law a form of torture and you're putting kids through that is it possible so first of all ceasefire yes and longer term is it possible for arab states and the united states to get together and with power through diplomacy enforce a solution it's a very very ideal solution but you know and i know that arab states don't really have the power all of the powers are in the hands of america they have the power see i would i think they have the power i don't maybe they don't wanna use it they they don't wanna well that's maybe they don't because there's a benefit like maybe there's a benefit that dark the dark sense i have is that a lot of people win from the suffering that palestinians are going through because they can point to that and distract from definitely definitely corruption in their own states and then obviously iran can benefit also from the same kind of dynamic distracting from the the authoritarian nature of their regime definitely but what is the core of the problem here is it the arab states using the suffering or the actually the the the suffering itself and the suffering comes from people being displaced their homes were taken away there are seven million palestinians in diaspora seven millions seven million went out there and now they're living in canada and america and europe they had homes there they cannot go back to one point seven million people of the people in gaza don't belong in gaza they were pushed from other places the the piecemeal thing of people are being you know in in germany i'm gonna shift gear a little bit it's gonna be a little bit of fun there is a there is a book that i bought the rights to and i want to turn it into a movie and i bought i optioned the right for two month for for two years in march of last year before october seventh after october seventh i bought the permanent right mhmm that book is called the muslim and the jew and it is written by an author called ronen steinke i read an article about this book in two thousand and sixteen and i chased that book for rights for seven years i didn't have that much money but i wanted that book and that book was translated into english called anna and doctor helmi and that book tells the incredible story under nazi germany where arabs went in droves to berlin in nineteen twenties after the first world war in the weimar republic and they became doctors and engineers and journalists for two reasons number one it's just they're cheap very cheap because of the inflation and two a lot of the arab nationalists didn't want to send their kids to to england or france because they were the occupiers and doctor helmi was the hero of that he's an egyptian doctor and that's why i kind of like personally kind of connected with him and he went to school medical school didn't find a place to live so he lived in the jewish ghetto like many arabs he didn't find a school to work at a a hospital to work in so he worked in a jewish hospital so these are there was a lakota virus who lived with the the ghetto and actually the the first director of the berlin mosque with a jewish convert who converted to islam and he was a gay activist i'm telling you this is like a crazy story yeah and this is all this is not a fiction story this is not this is actually like a nonfiction it's written actually based on the statement the documents of the nazis and gestapo doctor helmi he was in this hospital and the nazis came in and they killed and tortured and beat up the jewish doctor and he made they made him the head of his department then he was so now he is surrounded by nazi doctor they didn't touch him because he was an arab there was kind of like a thing between germany and the arabs because they wanted to appease to them mhmm in order to have kind of a a a grassroots base in the arab world where he want to go next mhmm and this is why nineteen thirty four nineteen thirty five the racial laws of nuremberg they had a name change first they were called anti semitic then they changed into anti jewish because also arabs were semitic so they wanted to appease the arabs now what happened doctor helmi when that happened to him he would go back to the ghetto and he would see the apartments next to him the jewish apartment become more and more and more flooded with people because they were moving jews and pushing them and putting them together pushing them to the side and each each plat each flat each apartment instead of one family it would have three four six seven families and he was there when he told me and he looked he was he was there this is where the people he grew up with he he he lived with and now he's seeing that kind of discrimination just because he was an arab and then he he started to kind of like atone for like because he felt responsible because he wasn't treated the same way and he started to go and treat jewish people in their homes because they couldn't go to hospitals and then one family gave them his daughter it's like this is anna save her he took her pretended that she's his niece put a hijab around her taught her arabic called her nadia my not my daughter's name by the way mhmm and they and and he hid her in plain sight for seven years in front of the nazis as his nurse it's an incredible story and then not just that he went to prison and then he went out and he formed with the arab people that was in prison with him a network that saves three hundred jews see that kind of story this is the jews that were living in the arab world i'm not saying that the jews living in the arab world was living like an incredible life of course as a kind of a minority they did not have like the full power of their full you know advantages of the rule that's that's normal but we had this kind of a a relationship before israel was erected in nineteen forty eight and then of course everybody looked at jews at the time as fifth column and of course the nationalistic regimes used that and this is why what biden said was very dangerous when he said if there's no israel no jew in the world will feel safe you are the leader of the free world you are the president of the united states do you mean that you're telling me that the jews in your country in the united states of america are not safe that is wrong on two levels number one america historically and right now is more safe to jews in america in the world than anybody they are safer than the jews in israel they never had pogroms or the holocaust like europe they live here a good life not perfect life but they are better second of all if you're the president and you're telling that a group of people will not feel safe unless there's a different one you are already feeding into their fifth column they're like you're russian you come from there and there is a a group of laws in the russian constitution that says that russia will protect its citizens everywhere in the world what happens if the president says like oh you're russians you protected my home country you don't belong here this is terrible yeah you're right that's actually an indirect threat it's like yes you know even saying muslims cannot feel safe in america or something like this that that means like that's a threat but what what would a jewish person in beverly hills or in in in in brooklyn feel if he hears that you are already telling people you need to be loyal to israel i mean israel is a foreign country i am sorry but israel is a foreign country israel is a client country that we sponsor and it is should actually be responsible and held accountable for what they do you mentioned nineteen forty eight the napa but before that forty one thirty nine forty one to forty five the holocaust mhmm what do you do what do you do with the holocaust like what how do you incorporate into the calculus oh yeah of what's oh it's terrible actually of morality that that leads up to the displacement of seven hundred thousand palestinians from the land how do you work that out i i it is terrible but like i mean what the the the systemic annihilation of jewish people under the nazi that is like a like a carefully engineered thoughtful planned it was terrible it was like kind of like the human ingenuity put into like something that is very evil but also it is not just that happened we need to remember that otto frank the father of anna frank has his visa refugee visa rejected by the united states there's a lot of people that were rejected by the united states rejected by other european countries and then they were pushed into palestine so you have to put yourself between it like and that the arabs okay we're sitting here okay come and then alright you don't have a a a home or a country anymore that that that that that that gives you i mean you see if i'm not an arab and you give me that kind of piece of like terrible human treasure like oh my god that is terrible but then i'm an arab like yes i'm so sorry but what do i have to do with that what why is that my fault the the persecution of the jewish people have started since the eighth and ninth century because they they were like they were first anti christians they were like with criminal immigrants they were like conspirators there's there's this this is this is this is the the antis like people kind of like as if europe kind of like throw antisemitism on us you understand that like henry ford henry ford is one of the biggest anti he was he was the the inspiration for adolf hitler this is how anti semitic for henry ford was and you kind of like gloss over that and then suddenly we as arabs have to pay the price why several questions i wanna ask there so but one just zooming out why do you think hatred of jews has been such a viral kind of idea throughout human history oh it's very easy it all started from christ they killed christ they killed christ they killed christ they're the killer of christ that's a very sexist one and that was so yeah that was and that stayed for years that stayed for centuries i'm sorry centuries they're the killer of christ and then the the catholic church church did not allow usury but they would work in usury so they become rich now the people that we hate that we accuse them of feeling christ are becoming rich so that's envy now and that's that and and and that's hatred i mean i mean when you talk about ghettos ghettos were not just a secluded parts in cities sometimes those ghettos were outside the cities jews were not even allowed to work a lot of professions they were not allowed to get into the syndicates of certain professions so they had to go work usually and they got rich so they they they people hated them more the first the first crusade didn't kill a single muslim all they killed were jews and when they finally arrived to jerusalem all they killed were jews they they almost annihilated the jews so it was all this and of course you have the dark ages who do you need as an enemy the jews right they they're the killer of christ there's nothing bigger than this and then you you fast forward i mean one of the things that i that i found out that was very very very very crazy when henry ford imported the the protocols of the elders of zion by the way in the arab world protocols of the elders of zion is so popular and for obvious reasons and for the people who don't know it it's kind of like a bunch of like stories and basically it's like the the the the the jews saying like we're gonna control the war then we're gonna do this then we're gonna do that then whatever what people don't know that the that is a work of plagiarism mhmm it was plagiarized from a satirical play called conversation in hell between machiavelli and and montesecchio and it is just it it it is and it is kind of like based on one chapter or one scene or it it's crazy but it's crazy how sticky it is like yes that's weird yes because if i if i hate you that's great but if i have a story to support that hate that's even better but it's like one of the one of the best stories one of the stickiest stories about hate of course it's probably the the most effective because like they're you know a lot of peoples hate other groups of peoples but that that's just like the sexiest story of all because humans need to concentrate their hate their insecurities and their shortcomings into one thing that they can practice that that hate on if it's a it's a it's a person great if it's a group even better right how do you into this calculus incorporate that that group is pretty small there's sixteen million jews worldwide mhmm and you mentioned how is that the responsibility of the arab peoples you know everybody should be to blame for not taking in jews after the the holocaust but you know the reality of the situation if we look at the religious slice of this there's sixteen let's say million jews and there's i don't know how many muslims but one point eight billion yeah yeah how do do you that difference that hundred x difference do you incorporate that into the sense that jews in israel might feel for you know the existential dread that we might this this small group might be destroyed jews in israel have every right to feel afraid because of everything that they see and everything they've been told everything but i i i would say that the calculus or the numbers doesn't like of course like being small it is of course a factor but it is never an excuse in order to take something that's not yours it's saying like hey you have three hundred million americans and we have fifty two fifty two says give one state for another there's too many of them too too many of you just give them something mhmm you know it's like the fact that i have something and you don't and i have there's too many of me and there's little of you and then you come in and and it's not really israel against the arab world or the muslim world because we have to say we fucked up big time but it is the the the the the the palestinians that are in and they are being subjected to that so it's not really like the one point eight billion and the sixty million jews and the one point eight billion if you look at them some of them like don't care some of them live into regimes that being oppressed and those regimes are supported by the united states in order it's easier for me as a as a as an empire to to take what i want from this country if i control the dictator and i tell them that his power is linked to my ability to to to my my desire to keep him in power so that's why you have a total disconnect between people in power in in the arab and the muslim countries and the people themselves can you speak to the nineteen forty eight you know because you mentioned taking land that's not yours maybe parallels with native americans mhmm yeah there was a war the the jewish minority fought that war against several arab states and won that war how do we incorporate that into the catholics yeah well that's also a misconception like event because it seems that it was like the small the my the it's kind of like a david and goliath kind of story but and i was always like how did we how did we not do that but in in reality with numbers i i can't pull it up right now but if you look at the numbers the number of tanks the planes the the trained officer because those many of those jewish fighters came from world war two they were seasoned fighters and they actually had more planes more tanks more artillery more pieces of weapon more of the all of other combined because they the the the people that really like fought was egypt and you have some nineteen forty eight some many of those arab countries didn't even have their independence so they would kind of like send like a cavalry or like a people in horses but in fact the whole idea was like we won against seven nations the numbers were totally in israel's favor they were better equipped they were better trained they had like more tanks and artillery and airplanes and they plan plan better so they yes they deserve the win because they plan and we did it so to you there was an asymmetry of military power even then but what do you do with the fact that the war was won so like if you look at the history of the world mhmm there is wars fought over land mhmm i agree with you this has been the history of humanity humanity was not living peacefully it's all about like people taking people and e killing people taking their land but there's two difference here mostly usually the conquering power like for example england they had england and they conquer you in india and after the occupation finished they go back to england france greece persia egypt they will like go and expand and shrink expand and shrink so it's all been there what is different here is exactly what happened in australia and the united states a group of people came in not just to conquer and take the land but to completely change that to replace them and get them out or kill them it was very easy with the indians because they had smallpox there was no social media they did it over four hundred years they had time the problem is what is happening right now i agree with you it might not bad be that new but we are there and we're watching it happen and so now we have to confront the realities of war and empire and conquering and because you know what's the problem we told ourself we can be better yeah after nineteen forty eight there was the universal declaration of human rights it means that we are gonna be better humans we're not gonna kill and take land we're not gonna displace people we're not gonna take people for their there's now laws there's international laws there's international court of justice and now israel is giving the middle finger to all of them so isn't in some fundamental way this whole thing that we're talking about is us as a civilization on social media in in in articles and books in in newspapers we're just trying to figure out who are we as a people i i think that the shock came from the fact that we thought that we as humanity have evolved and now we are what have actually changed is that we became more advanced in effectively eradicating a group of people because of the technology that we have and the fact that we can do that under the eyes and ears of all the world and we are watching it under our phone we have a window we have a window to the war you know nineteen forty five people didn't know what was happening in japan what well we heard about it in the radio like oh today our forces we don't know we heard it we maybe we saw pictures after that and it's quite edited but now we see it we're into it and it is it is so much for our for for our psyche and we can't get it and it's like and then the arabs will say like guys you told us we came to the west because we were told that we were equal you know the university declaration of right one of the co authors his name is stefan hesl he's a jew he is a survivor of the holocaust and you know what happened to him he died by the way a couple of years ago but he before he died he was canceled by so many people and he was called antisemitic because he joined the bds movement and he spoke of palestine that is the author of the universal declaration of human rights that we value so much and we think that that would define our humanity but then we go in and we are shocked it's like maybe we were sold something maybe that was false advertisement you shared a tweet by an account called awesome jew it reads islamo nazi comedian bassem youssef comedian in quotes by the way yeah yeah yeah of course because i'm not funny so islamic nazi comedian bassem youssef is now denying doctor i i love that you retweet like this like twice yeah i guess suppose because it's advertising some upcoming dates yeah is he he's now denying october seventh massacre the muslim radical bassem youssef is notorious for his radical radical said twice for his radical hatred of jews in israel in a recent clip he claims that the atrocities committed on october seventh are are fabricated or looking for all information regarding any of his upcoming shows as well as the venues which host the scumbag where jews feel safe around this nazi nazi yeah i've never this is my first time interviewing a nazi it's been a honor it's the first time i actually get called a nazi first time first time i have been called so many things in egypt so in egypt i was called cia operative a musaad spy secret muslim brotherhood a secret a secret jew secret jew there was also an article that was published about me in the state run media saying in details how basim has been recruited by cia agents using jon stewart in order to use satire to to bring down the country i was a freemason an infidel a a member of the the the the the the knights of the temple something like that and there is actually people that the muslim brotherhood on their show they would say like he is actually israeli and they have forged an egyptian id for him to come so it's kind of like when i guess like i i said i had i left all of that behind and i come here it's like boom semitic nazi damn i mean i really covered everything i don't know what else i mean i think i have yeah it's kind of like i'm collecting phds i'm i'm just like getting like all of these credits and how do you deal with that how do you deal with the attacks i mean i mean this goes back to the decision to do the interview with pierce morin like how how do you like psychologically do all of it these kind of attacks at the beginning it's fun but when they evolve into something else so for example i was like laughing off all of the stuff about calling me this calling me that but then when people would come and and thread the theater because it's not the people who are making those accusations that would come to you it's the people that will hear and see those as accuse accusations and act on it and there's always the fear of like i mean we have we have in the airport a lot of things like somebody would hear something about someone else and go kill him and whatever like anybody else so there's this but somehow i wanna make fun of it and and it is to be called a net an islamo nazi it must been the funniest thing ever because it doesn't islam nazi wow how did you how did you and a radical muslim me a lot of islamist hate me they do call me a secular infidel so it's kind of like who am i maybe i have an identity crisis and i need the people to tell me who i am let let let's go to the beginning let's go to your childhood you grew up in egypt cairo egypt my childhood well let's figure out how you came to be who you are how did you become an islamo nazi yeah exactly it's a long journey i do like the swastika tattoo on your ass which i didn't how did you see my ass you know what you did i know i did that it was very inappropriate you're also obviously a sexual harasser of me is this is this like a me too yes is this is this like twenty twenty or is this someone who come up is like okay we have flipped it this is your me too moment alright so cairo what's a what's a what's a defining memory positive or negative from your childhood my memory in general was was cool it was cool i went to a catholic school until the for for primary school elementary and by the time i'm done there was kind of like a start of a decline into the public education and my parents they're like middle class working officials my dad was a judge my mom was a business professor and she's and they were like one of the people who's like they didn't have that much luxury my dad like drove like a regular like car a fiat which is like the equivalent for the lada in in in russia yeah thank you for speaking to the audience yeah yeah into the lada and well so would that be a good car or bad car it's kind of like kind of like the minimum and my dad was not a command of of of showing off he whatever money they would do they would put it for us education give everything to their kids this is kind of like a very very typical mentality and i'm sure it's in many cultures but like we grew up with this like everything that we have is left for kids kids so they would put us into education so middle school that was the big nineteen eighty six was the beginning of the explosion of like international schools private schools and these schools were relatively expensive of course now with today's currency it's ridiculous but at that time it's very expensive so i went to that school and from there was this moment it was like you feel less right away i mean the p of course there's the the regular bullying and stuff but it's it's not that it's kind of like you always feel less you don't have that much of like purchasing power that you to go to the same outings or travel with them and even like how you dress it will be modest compared to them so i was always an outsider i was and i compensated with that by two things being good at school and being good at sports so i was not like the typical nerd it was just like that i was like i was playing football basketball field and i was like one of the people would like to have me on their team so i wasn't like kind of like he's in there get him away but i never had a girlfriend i never had any kind of like it was not like i was not boyfriend material mhmm so that's kind of like it it leaves remnants in you that you're not good enough but psychologically you were always like when you were by yourself you felt like an outsider yes all the time and that's why it's kind of like i'm more of a loner i don't have a lot of what do you call friends i have acquainted these people that i do stuff with but i don't i have like the people that i tell them everything when i went to medical school now medical school is a different animal medical school is where all of the people from the public schools go public schools are very like they are not they they don't have like they they don't have english language as like a strong partner but they are brilliant people so because they would mostly study in arabic but they are brilliant and they are very very very smart very sharp but then i'll go there now i am the sissy boy from the private school that comes into medical school now i'm an outsider again and i go into i i go into residency and i pick up salsa so now i'm a salsa teacher while being a cardiothoracic surgery resident and i'm an outsider for the third time because in salsa yeah i'm kind of like the respectful doctor and in resident i'm the guy who is just dancing so and everything of course as a radical resident you will mess up a lot yeah so they would always like oh because you're a dancer oh because you don't care about medicine you just like wanna go there and dance with women which is true yeah but but and so all of my life i felt that i'm an outsider i'm not part of the team i'm not part of the core group so with and and i have a a story that you would love i right before my residency i was so much into selfless so i i had all of the money and then you save that and i was working summers and i was doing extra jobs and i took that money and i went to miami in order to nice to learn yeah rueda di casino which is the cuban kind of like circle salsa kinda thing and i and i went there in the summer of two thousand and one yeah and my return ticket was nine twelve two thousand and one universal that sounds like humor i gotta tell you that nine nine twelve i was supposed to be on a plane coming back to egypt what happens thank god i ran out of money ten days before that just like alright i changed my ticket and i came back nine eleven i'm kind of like steven but my mom wake up wake up what what it's like and i see like the two tower phone it was like i'm almost like oh you're here you're here you're here it's like oh you're here yeah that and i was like i was like i should i could have been in guantanamo right now yeah fly flying at nine twelve and but by the way i was in miami they were they when they went to the the flying school in miami so i mean i i had i i had like nine eleven written all over my face he'd be all over the news and my mom was like what he went there to dance salsa i didn't know that salsa is like a name for everything why salsa why why why did that attract you and what like can you explain what salsa is so i i mentioned to you offline that i've been doing a little bit of tango trying to learn it yeah so like you know samba salsa picciata meringue it's kind of like latin dances and it's like you know i i don't know how you describe sounds like couple dance on latin beat and i i did it because i i once i and i talk about that about my in my arabic stand up comedy not the english i talk about like how i was you know i didn't have like really like a great like social life and i my friends went there one day and then and i go go into a place which go it's it was called el ghetto negro no no it was called big fat black pussycat and then i think they they they thought it will be like racist or something to switch to change it to it'll get to an egg group anyway so great great i know great decision i know so i went there and said damn music mhmm and women mhmm and my doctor a doctor dancing salsa that is a cheap magnet yeah hundred percent but we know we do you know we do everything for for that all of human beings even power even money all the wars we've been talking about women for for for at the end of the day the approval from the other sex we are we are babies we were we are terrible people yeah so of course like i mean that was like that was like great but then i as as a nerd i went in so hard and now i became a salsa teacher yeah and i earned more money from salsa more than i did as a doctor's as a doctor's i didn't know this part of you that's hilarious i know i was i was making i was making killing amount of money like huge amount of money and i i was just like you know i would go finish my my my shift and i go to the salsa class and sometimes i would have like seventy people in my salsa class oh wow i had like the biggest salsa class in egypt in the beginning of two thousand and it was fantastic and it was an outlet because you go there and there's the shifts and people dying damn and they go salsa they're gonna escape you must have been good i i was okay i was cool i was fun there were people better than me but i i i i have a a thing about teaching i like teaching people so you you mentioned heart surgery so what what motivated you to become a doctor it was a a choice of exclusion i mean there's nothing else you can do with these high grades other than doctor and engineering i hate math so go be a doctor this the middle east what do you expect it's either at at the the like i in my joke in my show i said like there's it can be one of three things in the middle east a doctor an engineer or a disappointment it is the that is the choices that you have so years after i'm a disappointment yeah i go you're damn good at it though that's a hard path though yeah right and it's it's a fascinating one can i tell you something yes that actually i was thinking about why did i actually go into medicine and why did i always choose the hardest thing although i didn't love it and i have to tell you i had an epiphany only two weeks ago and i don't know if that's actually related or not you know remember when i told you i went to this school and i didn't have that much money and i didn't have the luxury of time or money to be with those people and do what they do so by the time i finished school and everybody was going to university all everybody in my school went to the auc the american university in cairo of course private no no like american education party time like i mean of course they're brilliant and everything but they have yeah they they have a different you know social life and part of me now i i kind of like i realized that just like very very recently maybe i went to the hardest school ever so i don't have space to use other than studying because if i have that much space what i'm gonna do with it i don't have that much freedom i don't have that much money i'm not i can't keep it with those people going out so maybe i need a solid excuse that i'm in a place where i don't have that much of a spare time is it also possible i like how this is a therapy session where we're psychoanalyzing it yeah is it also possible that you always just pick the hardest thing you could possibly do maybe but maybe that's the piers morgan thing too like what it maybe but like when i left egypt and i came here i still had the choice to go back to medicine sure but i hated it i hated it medicine traumatized me the amount of like you give up you know my my brother in egypt he had a daughter she's a brilliant basketball player she is in the national team amazing i i used to play basketball also in the egyptian league but i never i was kinda like my favorite position in the court was the bench mhmm and i was not as good as her but she and then and then he he it was time for her to go into into college yeah and he he didn't talk to me for six weeks i said miss tamer what what's happening to farida which college like i didn't wanna tell you she went into medicine i said what medicine why did he do because he knows how i hated it i was traumatized i said no she's and and i said like dude she's a basketball player make her go like to an easy school it's like nah so that's kind of inspired still did it you still did it yeah i still did it but i don't know is it because of the difficulty or because because of what i told you maybe i needed something maybe because i was not very confident in my social life so i needed a distraction not to be to have that much of a social life oh wow okay you understand yeah uh-huh so it's it's kind of loud because i will always have an excuse i'm studying i have something i have exams and i don't know but i kind of like self sabotaged my own thing because i couldn't compete with with those people on on the outing and the money and whatever so i need an excuse to be it's like oh he's a doctor he's studying at least in your own mind you couldn't compete yeah yeah yeah i i i always felt as less because i mean i i didn't have any girlfriends in in in school i had a very little life i had everything to me came to life so i always felt even stand up comedy it came very late to me in life so i always feel that i'm not good enough mhmm i feel that i didn't spend the time of to fill the foundation that other comedians do so i always feel that i am too lucky mhmm i always feel that this is a fleeting thing and when i went ahead the the the height and the fall the fall of in egypt when i would like mhmm the top of of everything i was like so so famous and then everything was taken away from me that's like ah you see i told you that's happens when you don't build foundation you fall so i always feel that i that i am not good enough or if i am in a position where people think i am deep inside i am not you know that i have a speech impediment that i was not meant to be a tv presenter mhmm i have an in arabic it's very obvious i cannot roll my r's mhmm i cannot say i cannot roll it so in arabic like spanish it's very obvious mhmm so when i did my first video on the internet that made me famous and then i got my television deal back there there in egypt my partner at the time he took the video and he went to a producer i said like are you giving me a guy with a lisp he couldn't he should that's why when i came on television i was the first ever guy with a lisp i had two things going for me the lisp and the big nose and i was always bullied for two for these two all the time so i always felt less see but that's the foundation of like creating a great person yeah because if you're pretty you don't need to do much i probably wouldn't recommend it but it is it is true that so if you are pretty do some disfigurement yeah cover find the flaws and and be extremely self critical about them so you saw jon stewart on tv for the first time in in two thousand three i believe how did that change your life i was in a gym and i was running on the treadmill and at that time cnn was coming out for on like on cable and i was watching and there's this studio i don't know what it is so i put the the earphones on and i started watching and i was so taken by this that i stopped the treadmill and i just like stood for the twenty minutes like this on the treadmill and then i left and i just like was standing there i didn't know what we what he was saying i didn't understand what is democrats what is republicans what is what the those names that he's saying what is fox news i don't understand but i was fascinated mhmm there was something you know when you don't understand the music but you get the rhythm mhmm it was that i wonder what that is that you saw it's like the timing of the humor i mean there is jon stewart is one of a kind like his biting criticism of power i would say and also ability to highlight the absurdity of it all but you understand i didn't understand any of that but i didn't make any any of the references but it is the the the rhythm the yeah the rhythm you know sometimes when you even see like a comedy that is that's a language you don't understand but there's a rhythm yeah there's something there's something in the music yeah there's some so there's something with the videos and the pictures and he and the face and people reacting yeah what is this what is this yeah yeah what is this and we we had the the global edition so i went to the youtube and i just like started to kind of like watch every single episode that i can i said like do you think we can have this in egypt i said never and then twenty eleven like i had a a friend of mine who was also a youtube partner it was something new at the time he said like let's do something on internet let's do something i said like i wanna do john stewart it's like do ray william johnson john stewart will not work it's like i want to do john that one so that was in there yeah it was in there and and and i and i and i did it and it it can you talk about twenty eleven i mean what what is it the arab spring what is it people here in america you know depends on which side something happened or what depends depends which side of of the equation you are because for a lot of people it's a conspiracy it's american made it is the muslim brotherhood it's the islamist it is israel it is everything else other than people oh but it's a pure revolution it's a pure i i i i i think we put too much weight on conspiracies i think it is normal human behavior that then become get maybe used or abused or taken advantage of by other powers and then the conspiracy mhmm starts but at the time the arab spring didn't start in egypt it started in tunisia mhmm buasi is a a fruit vendor blew like burned himself up like the american soldiers who did that a few days ago and that kind of sparked protests in tunisia and ben ali was a dictator in tunisia for about like twenty years and they removed him so suddenly it was kind of like a domino effect so then egypt started and and it just took eighteen days and you know people hindsight is twenty twenty he said like you know just mubarak became like a burden on the military because the military are the real rulers of the country you may you might have a president that kind of like have certain powers but at the end of the day when the military sees that a certain president is like too much of a burden too much of like a you know so like they cut him off emma vargas is the leader of egypt at that time he was there for thirty years thirty years by the way speaking of which because it was a joke in your mark twain speech yeah i got tear teary eyed just watching that that was just great you're like yeah fucking great like what you did when mark twain awards for john stewart is great i mean your comedy is great in general and i wanted to go to your show i i definitely will please but that's a that's like a little stroll on the complete tangent of just a masterful introduction and celebration of john stewart anyway mubarak yeah so so i and and it's it's a joke that they say also like mubarak had like was a president for thirty years like oh my god yeah the president for thirty years like it's the middle east it's a very short first term it's just like it's like we're still warming up baby it's warming up and and i i tell them like we need to plan ahead we need to plan our yeah our our our vacations our careers our jail time it's just like we need to it's great so true so we had kind of like the shortest nicest revolution eighteen days yeah and we thought oh eighteen days we can change the country in eighteen days so but of course we were naive and we had this kind of hope so mubarak was removed there was an interim period by the military took it for one year then they did elections muslim brotherhood came to power they stayed for for one one one year and then their military removed them and in these three years my show started it started by kind of like a youtube video it became famous overnight overnight yeah five five to six videos boom went out and at that time i was waiting to get my clearance to go to cleveland i i i i was accepted in a fellowship as a pediatric heart surgery in a in a hospital in cleveland and and i said alright i'm just gonna do a couple of videos maybe i'm gonna put it in the internet and maybe after a year or two after i come back from the fellowship somebody will come hey why don't you write a show that looks like john stewart mhmm that was my man took five weeks i had my first contract of of television and overnight the exposure and over a the next two three years i had thirty to four million people watch thirty to forty million people watching every episode a lot of this like wow that's too much that is terrifying yeah because it means that there are thirty million people who have an opinion about you yeah you said there's a lot of aspects of that sudden fame that were just horrible it's toxic it's toxic it's unnatural it's unnatural the when people started to recognize me in the street and take pictures i was awkward it's like why do you wanna have a picture with me why why is it because i didn't feel that i'm worthy enough to be like a reward for someone to have a picture and i didn't understand it i was actually i was kind of an ass sometimes because people thought it was arrogance no it was confusion and i i remember like my director and my producers and people around they always saw me in a very bad mood it's like why are you why are you not enjoying this it's like because this is not natural this is not natural this adoration this love and this have to end somehow and it did and in because at at a certain point you are human you and people kind of the adoration and the fun and the love comes because they see you saying stuff because you do your job basically political satire is basically us making fun of politicians in the media and a lot of people have a really strong opinions about politicians in the media so we came there we articulate that and we give it to them and we make them laugh so for them we made a great job so why don't you do more mhmm but you are limited and at a certain time you can't and at a certain time you're afraid because we're humans because you're afraid about like if i continue speaking up not like something will happen to me i'm kind of like maybe have some protection because i'm i'm folk people see me but what are the people around you mhmm and we i've seen that so that's why at a certain point like that's it i i can't i mean there's a lot of things to say there but one of the difficult things of fame in your situation is you're not just having fun you're criticizing power yeah and and and and and it is loved by the people but it comes with a price because at a certain if the power is too strong and you're not into a situation or a or a or a or a system that allows that that gives you that kind of safety so what happened what happened i was so when so the height of all of my fame on what the muslim brothers were brotherhood was in power and at that time they had their media and i had one show i had like one hour per week and they had five channels twenty four seven and they were like you know i i'm i'm i'm busy john stewart said it beautifully one it's like we say shit and you say shit and we just say shit better than you this is exactly what jones do like we're just better we're real better at saying shit back to you yeah so so basically i had one hour and they had like the five thing that they were like you know they're calling me all kind of names not just me like all their enemies you know and then i just had one hour and i would kind of like annihilate them in one hour a week so at a certain point they would they would even like kind of be side with the army against the the the the kind of the the the liberal sectors whatever you call it and at a certain point the army kind of like flipped everybody what do you mean for that like kind of like they made they they they they yeah yeah they removed the muslim brotherhood they came to power and we i i i have to say i admitted i supported that in the beginning because i i had daily threats i had i was actually interrogated in a restaurant under the muslim brotherhood i was in in an interrogation for six hours and they were asking all the my jokes and i used that in my stand up comedy describing exactly what happened in the six hours and it is so funny okay well it's it's hilarious but what slow down you were interrogated by the the the the brotherhood the general prosecutor the general prosecutor and it was made based because of complaints by the the the officials in the government because in order to generate prosecutor to do it it has to have a high up mandate to bring that person to questioning so they went through kind of official channels oh yeah yeah absolutely so it's all yeah it was official it was legal very legal very legal so i went there and and and i and i asked and and it's kind of like a bunch of like insulting islam insulting president spreading false rumors and i went there and i and it was funny because i i go into the building where there's police officers and their judges and all of them are big fans of the show and some of them were taking pictures of me and then i'm sitting there and it was the most ridiculous interview ever because he was asking me about my jokes like what did you mean by this joke and it's like nothing it was there for six hours he's just reading he was just reading my jokes and he's reading the jokes and the junior judge is sitting there like cracking up he's like oh i remember that i was like guys guys that's dark it is it's kind of like and i'm laughing but in the same time it's like the whole situation is ridiculous but then at the end i i was released on bail so i went back to my show and i make fun of that and you have to be honest the muslim brotherhood were in power but egypt were like right out of the revolution for there was kind of like an equal spread of power between the people there was not like someone who would come in and just like the muslim brotherhood didn't have that power yet but they were kind of people saw that they were moving towards that and then the tension rose and then there was like a kind of a confrontation between them and the army and then a lot of people were killed in the street it was terrible massacre and and then suddenly i am blamed for all of that it's like you made fun of us so now it made it easier for people to kill us like dude come on you're doing that to me too i just did it better than you and the fact that you sided with the same people that flipped against you that's not my fault did you criticize the army at all did you yeah so after that show i did like one episode against the army and i was canceled the next day and then i went to another channel did sixteen episodes in a different season and it was i was walking on eggshells and then it that was canceled again and then my the production company that was doing my show that we severed ties because they're we didn't have the show they had their their offices raided they have people like having death threats so i woke up one day eleventh of november two thousand fourteen and my lawyer said like leave the country right now there is this legal case that we that that they kind of like they're coming for you but i said like you cannot it was an arbitration case and i lost against my my my the channel that basically canceled me and i said like i don't know but there's no jail time in arbitration it's like yeah tell that to the judges leave so i i jumped on a plane the verdict was twelve noon eleven november five afternoon i was on a plane left egypt and i never came back since then was there a worry of nonlegal things like assassination i can tell you something i was so stressed because of the show because of everything i sometimes i would wake up in the morning and i hope that my bullet will come and finish everything because i was so stressed it's like i would love because i'm too much of a chicken to kill myself so i would like rather have someone else do it for me so i i i i i was i was so under so much pressure and i remember the day that like my show was canceled indefinitely the second time under the army and i was like i don't have to worry about what kind of script i have to write next week because this is you know remember when you asked me about like that tweet but like all of those those accusations doesn't bother me infidel spy secret jew zionist the slummonazi that's bullshit what is really what really leaves a mark is the criticism to your craft and your work so you're not funny it goes deeper yeah certain things get you better than others especially if you have like a secret suspicion that you are like maybe not funny maybe i'm not because i was put into that it's like because that toast your insecurities like i know but you shouldn't say it out loud you shouldn't say the truth out loud you shouldn't say it out loud like give it yourself but what about the weight of the responsibility of speaking truth to power so like walking on eggshells like what did that feel like well after the muslim brotherhood were removed you have to understand like when the military coup happened it was a very popular coup mhmm like people love the arm the are the in egypt the army is more sacred than the religion people love the army but the army can go no wrong so me going against the army was i mean the muslim brotherhood was not very popular they were popular before their own basis but people accepted the fact that like we make fun of them but sisi at that time he was a god and i used to go to this high class club called gezir club mhmm and this is basically kind of like the kind of upper middle class upper class kind of people mhmm and i during the that year of the muslim brotherhood i was the most popular ever people come yay when the military came in people were walking to me like pointing their fingers like don't speak about cc don't speak about the army we love you now but don't you they would like that so i called john stewart just like i don't know what to do i don't know what to do and and at that time all of the channels were like closed down all of the the the independent ones were i was the only one left because it was difficult for them to get rid of me very quickly because i was too popular it was kind of like peace piecemealing kind of like and i remember something like i don't know what to do he said like you don't have to do anything just your safety comes first and he said but i can't i mean i've been doing that for two years and i cannot just like say bye bye guys i have a responsibility i have a team i have people working for me and i also i cannot just like disappear and he said the most interesting thing ever and say if you're afraid of something make fun about the fact that you're afraid of it instead of talking about that something brilliant yeah so there was like a whole episode that we did not even mention cece we did not even mention it but the videos did all the thing mhmm and the whole episode was me trying to avoid talking about him mhmm and that that that how the comedy was created mhmm the fact that i don't wanna be here and then so he said like if you will be surprised how people can relate to that because if there was a lot of kind of like oh we love him but we feel we cannot speak mhmm so just by doing the simple thing about mirroring the society that goes a long way and i kind of tried to do what i can under the military i mean they they came up with a machine that treats aids and hepatitis c virus and basically every single and and i went to town with that because people think it doesn't really have to go in to go to the bigger post like you're an asshole no you talk about their propaganda you talk about what they want people to perceive them at and that it's a failure and for that that kind of hit them even more because what do authoritarian figures do they work on two things fear and propaganda and from that it gets the respect so when you go into their propaganda and expose them they have nothing else that's brilliant so like you are walking on eggshells but you're doing it masterfully that you're revealing sort of the the flaws in the propaganda the absurdity of the propaganda and in so doing are criticizing them and this is why comedy is very specific because people say you were not as hard on him as you were in the muslim brotherhood yes because on the muslim brotherhood we were like just like saying saying shit for each other yeah but now the the the ceiling was like here so it's kind of like how can you do something from here yeah exactly that's the art form yeah in the in the soviet union under stalin the a lot of the criticism came from like children's stories and yeah and children's cartoons double meaning double in windows stuff that means other stuff you're gonna be real brave the brilliance yeah but everyone knows everyone knows because you are like putting a mirror like you're you're marrying a society it's fascinating actually and that's why i was canceled twice and that is a scary one the army you you see that in ukraine yeah everybody supports the army mhmm that's why zelensky getting rid of getting rid of the head of the army was a big big deal mhmm it's a really dangerous thing because because everyone support and everyone was afraid to say any negative about the army especially during war in that case and in this case maybe there's civil war that kind of thing but think about it actually an army during peace is much more dangerous because think about it i don't really have an enemy to fight but i have all of this power all of this tank why does this actor have more money than me yeah i'm protecting him why does this businessman think that he can get on his private plane and go to paris what and why i'm here sitting like not having all of these things so and there there's a lot of time of on your hand because your job is to go fight when you don't go fight and we when you have the lack of that's why that's one of the thing i love the united states about is the fact that the army cannot really get power but they kind of like the army is the power is actually in the military industrial complex which is a different issue yeah so it's kind of like a different kind of issue but if you have all of that power like why why am i sitting around just like playing guard for you guys that's why iran is terrifying because you have this military that it just becomes a police force that turns against its own people yeah so you're you're you're a famous guy talking shit in the middle of all that yeah and and i when i left i went through a very dark side dark dark dark because all of the insecurities all of the stuff that had been like working on my head now came to life and now i'm in america and i'm a nobody i'm a nobody and now it's like i have to do something i have to earn some money so i started to do stand up comedy five years ago and i sucked because it was my second language and i was new and now i would go to these comedy clubs with like kids twenty one twenty two people and then i'm there with the family to support that i'm going there to do it for fifteen dollars twenty dollars and and i was bad you're you're bombing bombing big time eating shit waiting big time dying up there big time and i would go back home and i would cry and then what made it worse is sometimes like a fan yeah like not a fan a bunch of fans from egypt oh vesemir used to feel that they come yeah just a star points with them that kind of like face of adoration yeah that that goes yeah and i could see it in their face i think he's gonna drive an uber in a couple of weeks that's that kind of pressure and i would go and i would cry and and i and and then the sense like oh you left you you you you you gave up you were a sellout you're a coward why don't you speak from abroad you're you're safe now like i i don't i already spoke i don't want to be because i don't wanna be an activist i was doing that for comedy when it was good for everybody but now they want me to go go into youtube and just like throw rocks from outside i was like you know what i understand i have family there yeah and and and it was this kind of like thing like that i am being like attacked for not doing what i should do in their face and attacked for not being funny and not doing good being and now i'm a feel like maybe it was wrong and i was i don't know i i really it was so traumatic that i don't know actually how i went through these years and i blocked so many details from my brain because i have been using this technique for a while now that i have been erasing a lot of my there is a lot of memory gaps in my brain and i'm trying to suppress it because it was very very very traumatic and a lot of people told me you have to go to therapy but i i don't i can't i don't know i i i'm i'm worried to open the floodgates and i'm thinking as if i'm functional and i'm not killing anybody i'm okay it's like i think yoland tweeted never went to therapy it's gonna be on my headstone yeah joe you're our best buds okay i mean that is like terrifyingly difficult to like after being a a surgeon after being a superstar super famous going to eat shit at local tiny clubs in the united states i mean eating shit period yeah like bombing is really really really difficult really difficult for twenty year olds imagine when you're forty five forty six and the and then people's like is this his midlife crisis what is i i i i i went through a lot of pain and a lot of like the doubts and it was terrible what i mean how did you survive i mean i know you blocked up most of it but what what gave you like strength through all that because i didn't have any other choice because i started that and the only reason that i could is to continue i i i i don't know what else to do i don't wanna go back to medicine i don't wanna do go i don't i don't want to do that and i don't i don't know i was and bit by bit bit by bit i started to kind of like be better be better be better and i was at a certain time a year ago a year ago this is where i started to kind of like hone the craft and kind of sell more tickets and sometimes even sell out some shows and sometimes sell a theater so like it was going and the money was flowing and it was good and then i was like why didn't i i want it faster i want it more i want it now i want it i want netflix deal or whatever and then the piers morgan thing happened and then i blew up and then suddenly i'm selling out everywhere it's like ah if those people came if that that that that war happened two years ago i will not be ready so now they come to the show and by the way my show had nothing to do with the october seventh my show is my thing that i've been crafting and working on you know how difficult it is to do the first hour that the the hour that i've been working on for five years and it's all my personal story all about like what happened to me usually to me as an immigrant coming here to the united states finding trump as a president finding myself in the middle of a gun rally finding myself in the middle of a bombing kind of like talking about how i got my citizenship it's all like funny stories about like my origin story so they come in and they expect me to work seven and all of a sudden my personal story but it's good and it kills and they love it and it's like if that if that kind of like blow up in america happened to me two three years ago i would not have people would come and be so the point i gotta say the timing of october seventh is very suspicious oh my god please don't say that i don't know i'm just asking questions i don't know i'm i'm telling you one of the funniest thing a guy he i was in dubai and like a tv anchor came to me pass him yousef he flourishes during revolutions and wars like woah wait wait what what dude you're you're making me sound like a bad omen a very bad omen yeah you hamas and bebe together trilogy you guys should go on the road together i'm telling you that phone call is coming yeah but hamas has to open and they would really bomb right they would really bomb i love dark humor you do a show like you were saying in english and in arabic mhmm so and the story is very different totally different two different stories i would love to just the language difference because it's the music of the language is also different so like what what's how can you convert it into words but what's what's the difference in the in the music of the languages i'll tell you because i thought about that a lot alright alright okay so when i was doing the english first yeah i was i actually had good jokes but i was missing the delivery because the cadence and the music and the rhythm is different the way that an english speaking americans member of audience will receive it it will be different than how i receive it the energy everything's different so when i kind of like got it i didn't know how to switch back to arabic oh wow yeah fascinating because here's the thing with english stand up comedy english stand up you have a huge library you have like a legacy you have like years and years and years and years of people doing comedy but in arabic it's very new to us and most of the arabic stand up comedy especially in egypt is very tamed this is kind of like imagine the stand up comedy scene in america nineteen sixties before lenny bruce oh so no swearing conservative no swearing nothing conservative everything kind of like not not yeah it's kind of like very so i didn't know what to do there so i broke the barriers i became danny bruce i became a jewish con so i went in and i went and i and i changed the whole thing words you're not allowed to say or whatever for me there fifteen words but yeah that's a lot that's a lot arabic is a very rich language yeah so when i did here's the difference between the arabic and the english show the english show surprise surprise is a unifying language even for a a group of arabs so if i give the same exact show to the same one thousand audience members in the same theater and they're the same people mhmm same makeup of like lebanese egyptian syrian saudis english will be a unifying language mhmm arabic is a dividing language right because you have twenty two dialects and the dialects are vastly different and like maybe egyptians understand a little bit of lebanese but not that much but their reference is algerian moroccan tunisian totally different animal that's like a totally different line saudi emirati kuwaiti totally different people understand the egyptian dialect because it's the dialect of most of the artwork and the movies but the reference in the everyday street talk might not be understood by them so now i have to go in and talk to all of these dialects together so i formed my big big part of my show is like what are you guys expecting of this this is what this is we gonna when it go do profanity and you're gonna like it mhmm this is the problem with that the show as a dialect and i'm and i'm i construct all of these sentences formed of so different different words for example an iron mhmm in any in any in in any arabic dialect is an iron in saudi arabia it means ass that's one example yeah that's one example you know so imagine if you can actually construct sentences having all of these things in one set so i would i would construct like a whole section of my show about that so it's really very much about like self reflective on language and the limits of language that's allowed and the limits of language and i tell them part of the show is like i know what's the problem with me doing arabic it's like if this was an english show and i was telling you fucking shit i bet you'll be but if i do one swear word all of you will scream yeah it's like why that's disgusting is it because we are ashamed yeah for our own so it's kind of like it is it's not just like about swearing it's about like there's a lot of philosophical mhmm pathways in this yeah there's profanity and then we we people have fun whatever but like it is about like what does how do we treat our language and i tell them we speak arabic as arabs but it's not the same arabic it's crazy right and you're doing the show in america also which is another level of oh yeah actually the arab diaspora in america is some of the best audiences i have they are like wonderful and they come from they just and i did and i do and i did it also in the middle east and maybe i'll do like an arab tour in the middle east in the fall which countries would you go to or not i already did jordan lebanon i'm doing uae i'm doing kuwait egypt bahrain egypt i don't think so i don't think so is it personal is it worry about your safety well i have the american citizenship right now so i am relatively safe there's a block sure honestly there's a block yeah there's a purse there is there is there's so much that happened and i don't and i never i never bad mouth each this is my country it is some like it has all of my marriage forty years of my life i lived there but when you get hurt so much instead of trying to kind of i don't wanna take revenge i don't wanna like that i just want to avoid because egypt gave me so much fame and so much love and so much hate and so much rejection it is a very it was a very tumultuous relationship very very difficult and it's and a lot of people tell me well don't you miss egypt and i tell them every time the egypt that i miss is not there anymore it's not bad or good it's not worse or better it's just i'm different and the places are different and the people are different and their circumstances are different whatever image you had you have of what you love is not there anymore that's why a lot of immigrants especially arab immigrants they they live here but they're there and then when they go back for a vacation they get disappointed because they didn't find what they want and then they come back here and they're disappointed because this is what they wanna come back but it's not there anymore yeah their view of that place is from a different time i have that you know my parents but everybody that left the soviet union i mean it's such a complicated relationship with that mhmm it's sometimes borders on hate disappointment mhmm in the in the case of the soviet union perhaps similar to egypt is the promises sold when you were younger mhmm and the the promises broken by the possibility of what it was supposed to be with the soviet union i'm sure with egypt it's the same iran is the same so they have a very complicated relationship with that yeah that's why like for example people from iran you know in my i remember i remember quite well the world cup that was made in that done in in the united states and the iranian team will play in america and there were people people in the audience all wearing they hate the regime but they have this kind of yeah connection with the country yeah and this is this is the whole thing you can actually love the country and you don't have to agree with the regime would would would you ever perform in the west bank no gaza because if i go there i have to go through the israeli checkpoints and i don't wanna go through the israeli i don't want to have an israeli soldier telling me what to do yeah there's a demeaning aspect to that whole very even even in subtle ways yeah yeah yeah i mean i have so many palestinian friends with an american passport us passport living here they are born here and they talk about the humiliation and the intimidation and the harassment that they go in it's like do you want me to try yeah that little bit of a humiliation a little bit oh sometimes it's major but i know i know i noticed that you know even a little bit is has a after a lifetime of that it can turn to it can turn to hate towards the other yeah and resentment resentment and then how do you do anything with that resentment i have a friend of mine he is from palestine from louis back he's american here he's born here and we talk about you know we have of course all of this discussion of what would happen and he tells me you know in october eleventh in the west bank and and there was a village called kosra and on that village like the the settlers went in around the village and they send a message on facebook it's like you rats going get out of your sewers and we're gonna be waiting for you intimidation through technology and then they went the the it is kosra have like another settlement next to it called the ishkodesh ishkodesh they have people there who were training something called mishmeret yishah which is basically the guardians of yishah and it's like a paramilitary group that trains other settlers on military combat give them weapons and do like military drills and they went there like militarized and went there and and it was actually cofounded by a jew from brooklyn not even and and and and like an israeli and he is like one of the disciples of meir kahane i'm sure that you know who meir kahane is who was the jewish defense lead the people who assassinated alex ouda here in the united states and and they were they were there with their weapons outside intimidating people now this story carries everything that is wrong with the situation you have people from brooklyn from outside just because they're jewish they can't come and they can't claim the land from the people there anybody from poland just because he's jewish he can come and take the land from other people they're using technology to intimidate palestinians they have unchecked military power these are not idf soldiers these are settlers and they have free reign in order to intimidate and to kill the people and you understand this is the daily life of palestinians not in gaza in the west bank what do you do from your what do we do what do people do to nudge this towards peace towards flourishing here's the thing i wanna talk to the people of israel what is israel doing right now is not just unfair to the palestinians it's unfair to the jewish people in israel no it is unfair to the jewish people around the world because the way that israel links itself to the jew to to judaism at a certain point you know remember like isis and when everybody hated muslims you know sometimes human humans are simple they cannot have the nuances to separate so anybody who with a muslim name with a muslim face with a beard who looks muslim he would do it because of that actions of those atrocities you have the power as a person to separate yourself from an abusive power a horrible power and be yourself i am really worried because the rise of antisemitism and the rise of hate against jews is not because of the jews it's because of the actions of a government jews do not have to be on the side of apartheid roni castrilles he is a jewish south african and he fought shoulder to shoulder next to nelson mandela he was part of the african national conference anc and he had an article saying like i know what apartheid is and i saw israel and this is what they have and the thing is israel that israeli government should listen to other people you cannot call anybody who who criticize you either an antisemite or if they're already jewish you call them like self hating jew you cannot do that you cannot continue doing that because we did that when i would go in and criticize the islamists it was like oh you're self hating muslim you're not really muslim you're an infidel you're a secret you're a secular whatever we have the power in order to reform the course by holding people in power accountable and the thing is it is very stupid to actually call this antisemitism like i my my my idol is john stewart i voted for bernie sanders the sarah taxler the one who did this amazing documentary about me tickling giants she's a jew she is married to an israeli jew we have a good ratio because we know what the right is they don't have to associate themselves with the action of the israeli government one of your favorite words jihad that's my favorite hobbies it's his favorite hobbies it's my and so it's my shoes like what's your his favorite it's like i talk about like how when a white shooter does something he talks about all of his family and all his hobbies like what if we took this for like for for for arab terrorists what are his hobbies jihad you see you should be a comedian yeah sure wow you're making me feel good okay sam harris has has done several episodes on jihad and people should go listen to it even if you disagree with it but the basic idea that he's proposing is that this idea of jihad in the negative connotation of it of martyrdom is a thing that gets is counterproductive is destructive to the possible future flourishing of palestinian people what what do you think of that there's just idea of modern i totally agree but like people don't wake up in the morning and say like i wanna declare your hat think about it why would anybody choose to end his life by taking other people with him and end that life his life must be miserable he must be pushed into that nobody chooses death over life willingly one of the first suicide bombers in the palestinian resistance were christians we don't talk about that i think he would say that the presence of a story that you can tell yourself when you're in a really shitty place mhmm that you can go to a much better place yep by sacrificing your own life just the fact that that the presence of that story is there is is is harmful of course but these but here here's here's my problem with sam harris and usually people will they have free range talking about the islamic faith and nitpicking the stuff that makes it put in a in a in a in a bad light i can go and nitpick every single religion there are jews there like ben gafir who openly say spitting on christians is not a hate speech alright there are i mean i i i you can bring me like all kind of videos of islamic jihadists saying horrible things on on youtube and i can bring you jews who live there they are so like we're gonna have the whole world enslaved for us and everybody would love to be slave for the jews you know i can use the talmudic argument that if you tie a man to a tree and he dies of thirst and hunger you didn't kill that man and this is kind of the same arguments like ah we're not killing palestinians it's just like killing man they were dying by themselves you know so it it is it the nitpicking of of of a certain narrative religious narrative that is separate from the political context and what what's happening right now it's very very unfair because i can read if you wanna have a deep dive into religious text nobody will be happy and i can bring stuff from that and the and the torah and stuff that is horrible but like you know this is a way again of like distraction i dare you to talk shit about buddhism and jainism though try well you know the people who killed the muslims in myanmar were they weren't they buddhist yeah well let's as a person who tries not to eat carbs i'm deeply offended by that i mean they're scientologists all they do is actually buy real estate i think there's a few books written about the fact that they do other stuff as well so even there mormons sometimes they're some of the nicest people i ever met yeah but i'm sure there's also darkness there too oh boy religion is it there's soaking in in mormon there's what soaking what's soaking okay so i don't know how much so soaking basically like you if if you get into the woman and you don't move that's not adultery that's not like oh interesting so yeah you go you go in and use the thing there's a loophole there's a loophole there's there's the thing a relation religion has a loophole that yes and with muslims we do that the whole time we we pick and choose our our sins the stuff that we enjoy it just we're here seventy two virgins waiting for all of us maybe if i converted you as a jew i'll get you eighty i don't know you know like we can negotiate alright but i also have questions about whether a very good deal i'll give you and maybe i'll throw there a camry i have a fiat camry it's pretty good what year i don't know nineteen ninety eight alright best year ever well they last a long time yeah so i'm not sure i want seventy i'd seventy two i'd well i'll throw five in the mix and see how it feels yeah can we if you wanna upgrade yeah can we can we do a trial period but in general if you just zoom out do you think religion is in what way is it good for the world and in what way is it harmful if there was no religion humans would have invented religion because think about it think of think of like the early humanity like you're like a caveman or whatever and then like you see your family members killed and then you say like what i'm gonna be like the the the sheet or the gazelle that just like ends in perish i need to have i i am more important i think i think with the development of consciousness humans like thought that they are much more precious and important than the other animals because they have now intelligence so my life will not end like that that would my death would be even more important there's consequences for that there's consequences for what i do and then the the the the early man was like there in the desert and all of these like natural phenomena they didn't know what to do they were afraid mhmm so they need to have refuge they need to have something to take care of they need to have a reason for everything because if there's no reason it's chaos mhmm it's chaos it's terrifying it's terrifying it's terrifying there's nothing there there has to be a reason there has to be a reason there has to be a purpose it has to be like a cause something it's the it's just i'm i'm not just gonna be like die like like a cockroach being stepped on and that that's kind of like part of this ego every the whole world rotates around you in a way it it's the ego so religion actually got a lot of it from humanity itself like me us like us being humans and there's and and and many religion is a collection of of of stories and those stories based on things that humans did themselves and they attributed it to gods and there's an aspect of religion where you humble yourself before a a thing that is much greater than you so that has a i would say a very positive effect of humbling it will be great if you stop there yeah but here's the thing if you humble in order that your ego kicks in and feel that you are better than someone else who's not humble than the front of the same god go there that means that i will have all the battery that i can use that because now what what does mean being humble i'm divine yeah but you're not i'm way more humble than you but you're not so you you see how they kind of like the oxymoron i'm humble and i'm surrendering but in the same time i am better than you and i'm more entitled isn't it crazy yeah it's beautiful it's crazy i mean look at i'm sure look look at like like the muslim christians and jews and everyone like you say alright muslims we surrendered i mean i'm talking about the extreme ones i mean like people like people say i surrender to god good keep it that way yeah like if you go to i surrender to god that means that i am closer to god than you then you should die yeah okay christians christ is love and he loves me and we're gonna be together but you don't get into his kingdom and you die you see it's the same thing yeah yeah it's just if you make stop it like stop stop there stop stop where you are humble and you feel that you're a piece of shit and you are worthless human being and you are there yeah stop there yeah but once you said like oh that makes me a better person than you and it makes me more with god than you so that would give me the entitlement to kick your ass yeah we always ruin a good thing don't we that ego you've been outspoken you know with piers morgan but just on this topic and you talked about the superman story which i would love it if you were in a superman movie but have you lost job opportunities because of this because i i there was other a couple of things that were going on but they stopped again i don't know if september seventh of the superman story just so yeah yeah so what role were you okay what did you audition for yeah it's okay okay okay sorry sorry so in june i was traveling to dubai and right an hour before i i get into the car and go there my manager said like bess we're gonna send you a script read it it's the for superman it's like oh superman you know i i i'm not really good in auditions i'm not an as in the actor so i was like okay i'm just gonna do it send the tape i do the tape i send it i go to the airport and and i read i and i can i think i can talk about it now because they said they changed the script so basically what i found it interesting in that new script is that there is like a a dictator in a country that invades another country mhmm and superman interferes politically that's the first time we ever see superman interferes politically yeah so basically it was like russia and ukraine but because of me it was like it had it couldn't be russia and ukraine so it had to be something kind of like with a flavor so i read the role as if as a mixture of trump and mubarak i i i i i i i did this mix and like you know like like like kind of the mixiness but also like kind of like the the the the the essence of trump into it i went to the airport it's like an hour it's like james gunn saw it he loves it what i never had an audition that fast i mean i i i had a few roles but not that fast not like that and then i said like well the the strike starts like tomorrow and we need to be on the phone but after the strike we cannot talk the second after strike like we're the writers and the actors strike so like well i'm gonna be on a plane right now it's like wait once you land you can have a zoom call with james gunn i have a call with james gunn he's i am a huge fan of him the guy took like something like guardian of the galaxy nobody knew about it made amazing trilogy and he is like a really cool guy i like i like what he did and it was like really nice and and he started to talk to me about the movie and you know like i talked to people before casting them so i know that everybody's on set have a good chemistry it was amazing so in your mind if you're an actor what does that mean mhmm you got the part and he told me you got the part month goes by strike goes by october seventh happens i do piers morgan one and two and then i go to my australian tour my manager called me bassem the circle's over it's like you don't get the part anymore i was sad very sad but for three days and and so like i need to stand up for this i'm actually doing very well and then when i went to chris cuomo i after i finished the show he told me did you lose any opportunities and that was off record after after the show was like we concluded and i said i talked about superman and i found myself when i was talking i was angry i was bitter and i went home i was like why was i angry why was i bitter it wasn't meant to me and i'm i'm living a good life now i i i don't need to so when i was asked again the next day in two different interviews the bbc and the other and another one was alone with my friend you know with allah i said the story in a different way i said i i don't have any anger as a matter of fact maybe if i was warner brothers i didn't talk about jim's gun i thought it was the studio if i was warner brothers and i'm a muslim i wouldn't have a like a zionist or a pro israeli in my movie but i want to tell them that like when i criticize israel i am not a threat to you as a jew and we can actually have more in common so i was more of a kind of empathic so when i said that the internet went crazy and you know james gunn have hatreds because you know the the snyderverse and all of the that it's just it's it's a word that i don't understand and james gunn like had all of these attacks on him and i was pissed off how it was handled i wasn't angry at james gunn but i thought it was and so my publicist the manager is like bessim stay calm don't speak it's better like to to like not talk about it i said okay so as a there's nothing wrong about me but i see the heat is rising against jers khan and that is a guy that i had a personal connection with even through zoom and i didn't like what was happening and then he called me and he explained to me as i said i asked him you know i actually use like have camera test before people before finally i didn't know that and i and then we changed the script and it was the strike so i didn't call and i also i thought to myself i'm small i'm a small actor i'm not that important for him to call me to say we're gonna change the script so i still think that like the timing sucks and everything but then i went and i did a video explaining exactly what i'm telling you because i didn't want to be famous for the wrong reasons yeah because that would be unfair because that that would there already people were and i was having like interviews can you come about the super i was like guys that's it i'm not gonna talk about it because this is an issue and i did i didn't and i when i talked to james on the phone i felt how sincere he was so i i i didn't want someone to because of me will have that kind of attack because i know what it means to be on the other side of that kind of attack it's terrible and it ruins your life and it ruins your day and nobody deserves to be doing that and i don't wanna be the reason for someone else to go through that pain and you also said that you don't wanna be a victim i yeah i don't want to be i'm doing a great i'm doing great i'm selling out everywhere i'm having a wonderful loyal audiences coming to me why i would be angry about the role of it's superman yes it's great to be in a superhero movies but so what you know but you know there's there's a wisdom in that even if you weren't doing great that's a choice a lot of people can come to which is like do i play victim here or not it's greed it's greed it they want more attention they want to be more into the thing they want more and more and there's so much to go around to be enough for all of us but it is greed it is ego ego ego ego i need to be in the center i need to be victimized i need to i need to be be people feel sorry for me and love me it it and it is not the right way it is not because it is fake it is fake it's made up and i did not victimize myself when i left for egypt i mean in the time that i was now i speak about it now but in that dark times i was detained in airports i didn't have the my american passport yet i i was still traveling with my egyptian passport and i was detained in an arab airport and i was going to be delivered to the egyptians i had shows when i was still starting i had hecklers being sent to me by the egyptian embassy and egyptian consulate in in new york and in london to curse me and to take videos of that and then send it to state run media in egypt and i didn't speak about that because i felt that like if i speak about that i feel about like what was going on to me i would be victimizing myself it's like if i'm gonna be good i'm gonna be good because of what i do not because of what people's perception of what i'm going through yeah and that becomes a slippery slope and somehow victimizing yourself goes to more victimizing yeah and then you cannot leave that habit you can only exist and thrive if people feel sorry for you yeah i mean israel and palestine currently both have that temptation i i would always push back when you do the comparison because one of them is not really in the same kind of power i mean yeah yeah for sure i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean it's very easy to say why palestinian would victimize themselves but israel with all of that military white man it's too much what israel is doing is that they're victimizing the jewish experience and i don't think a lot of the and i don't don't think it is fair for a lot of jews i don't think that they should use the holocaust and the persecution that happened to jewish people all through history in order to push an equally oppressive agenda that is not fair and it's not good for the jewish people living and it is basically a disrespect to the memory of the holocaust i told you i wanna make a movie about the holocaust i i do because what happened was that kind of engineer torture should never happen again and it should not be happening now so to you what israel is doing is leading to more antisemitism in the world hundred percent and i think and i know can i be a conspiracy theorist for a second please the earth is flat we all know this part of me thinking maybe they are doing that intentionally because if there's a rise of anti citizen and jews there will always like points like see they hate us so we can do whatever we want because if if because because you see if we let let go of our might and our strength we're gonna go back to the concentration camps because you see how the world hates you and and again when you say they are people in power yeah oh yeah absolutely listen it's always the people in power i believe that humans are easily corruptible and easily repairable but the corrupt corruptibility part is much easier but you you people could change but power people and power are very dangerous very very dangerous especially if you have religion which is power by itself military might political support and money dude that's the that's a very very very dangerous recipe that you know all that said i i do believe in the power of the little guy the individual to overthrow the government you know i don't know if you heard but the arab spring will you know happens but but but but okay here we are we are here to just among friends we are americans right we're americans yep allegedly we're americans and how funny is that like just giving our two backgrounds no no no we're americans we're americans it's like we're americans there's one thing about like the power of the little guy that i am very sad about because you see i love america by the way i consider it my new home and i want my kids to grow up here i have i'm very grateful for the opportunity that i have in the united states and i criticize the united states politics and i criticize it out of love the same way that i was criticizing what's happening of egypt out of love what is worrying for me is how the power of the little man is diminishing it doesn't matter now who do you vote into power they will not listen to you they would listen to the people who paid them to be there and it is very concerning because i can see the american democracies turning not even slowly very rapidly into an oligarchy if i'm i'm sure that all of the millions of people who are voting they don't vote for the nra they don't for for vote for apac they don't vote for the pharmaceutical companies they don't foe vote for the military industry complex and yet the people in power they come in they take your vote and my vote and they are loyal to those people not to us and it is very very very concerning very concerning and it is this is the danger of american on on american policies american politics and american democracies it is dangerous because basically the vote becomes just like a ceremony that that the the someone with the more like funding will get to power and then he's not loyal to you so the fire i mean we are in texas everybody everybody's armed to the teeth here yeah but like what are these armed gonna do in front of tanks well you said the the the american military is unique in this way i know but for now for now the tanks are first of all i believe russia has more tanks than the united states tanks i don't know you know i'm i'm not an expert in military strategic deployment of arms but the united states uses different kinds of weapons it's they have drones and they have the lasers and they have they're sitting comfortably behind the screens it's kind of like it turns like a big xbox game yeah and they they they sell a lot of those things to everybody it's crazy because the the defense budget is sixty eight percent of american military it's like almost eight hundred and fifty billion dollars each year mhmm and most of that weapons we don't even need it yeah we just do it because of the contracts there was like an incredible sixty minutes i'm sure that you saw it the one about like the gouging of the prices of the depart from this it was one of the most fascinating things that i've ever seen they said like a valve a safety of a safety oil valve that used to be sold for three hundred and twenty nine dollars now it is sold for nine thousand dollars why because there's only five weapon companies and they can control the prices and in two thousand and six the whole apache fleet of the american army in iraq was grounded because there is one valve that they were like gouging the price and didn't wanna give them them the stinger missile mhmm the the the just like the missile the the the the one that you carry and then and it's like the anti aircraft it used to be sold for twenty five thousand dollars now it's sold for four hundred thousand dollars and nobody is doing that because the dod has fired third one hundred thirty thousand people including engineers and negotiators so now in order to cut expenses now we're paying more money and the thing is we do not have a say in this we do not have a say in how my tax money and your tax money is being spent because i'm sure you don't want your money to be sent to israel like that i'm sure even if you're jews i'm sure i'm sure that like i don't want my money to be be given to some muslim countries who kill other muslims i'm sure but it is it is not here's the thing what kind of power do we have other than speaking so what is left for us is free speech and now when you speak they call you antisemitic you see why i'm angry but still i mean america's holding pretty strong despite the criticisms on the free speech front but if you look at the free free freedom of the press freedom of the speech index america is not at the top it is not and this is why for example it is very disheartening for me to see that the western media western press that used to be the beacon of freedom are now using as mouthpieces and it is funny how the new york times nixon got angry in the new york times in nineteen seventy one when they found leaks about tim lying on about the vietnam war since the beginning mhmm and now he hired the plumbers you know the special unit in order to go in and find the leaks this was watergate basically because he was angry to see who leaked that instead of fixing the problem now the new york times have published the story about the the rape that was a hoax that was written by anna schwartz with someone who have no experience and now when it was leaked instead of them correcting themselves they went in and they had their own investigation to see who leaked the new york times in two thousand and three became the mouthpiece of george w bush of the wmd and now as an american i see that the new york times becoming a mouthpiece of a foreign country why do you do that one of the things that's really difficult to know is where to find the truth it does seem that both sides use propaganda and both sides lie a lot but both sides as in both israel and palestine pro palestine palestine pro israel there's a lot of lies i know but the the it is i think you're it's a lot of inequality man are you like yeah there's like a lot of people on the internet but like who have the mainstream media siding with yeah but you know thanks to social media yes thank god for social media because now it's individuals there are people yes there are people you're you're comparing bbc new york times washington post wall street journal with just people with a tiktok account yeah a lot more power in your view now it is actually very very fascinating to see the little man having that power over the media and because disproportionately so like hey like that this is my problem but you cannot call people with tiktok propagandists while people being paid to kind of give you the the news and they deliberately lie to you yes i can they're both propagandists well pro pro okay yes yes but like the but the mechanism and and the intentions are different because because here's the thing i'd rather have the tiktok guy than the if if like the tiktok guy is a tiktok guy alright but if you have the new york times being told that they they being exposed to be lying and then they will get this like you and report which is like a disgrace mhmm and you just put the title and you don't talk about it like i'm fine with cnn and jake tapper and all of those people like spreading the rape allegations for years they didn't i don't even want them to refute them i want them to bring the israeli reports saying that it didn't happen the israeli media themselves they didn't even bother not once it's that balanced that's not yeah so that's why people in tiktok and but because they have to take matters in their own hand yeah but the the problem with the people in tiktok mhmm is the drug the the dopamine rush of getting a lot of likes so instead of talking about the death of civilians they'll talk about beheaded babies or the equivalent of yeah yeah they're they're they're going to actually make up stories because the make made up stories are going to be more viral and so now we're just in this sea in this muck of lies and there's a lot of people who actually exposed those lies on tiktok so you have both you have you have both and it's the kind of like the democracy of the social media as we always call it but if you have the street run media that is the legacy media cnn bbc new york times fox news all of those people and they are like spreading lies and they're not even doing their journalistic job in order to at least bring the other side yeah that's problematic and that's that's worse you're supposed to be a journalist yes it's supposed to be report report to you know report yeah but i you know i i see that that this is like a catalyst and inspiration for the citizen journalists to to rise up this is what you're doing oh this yeah this is what you're doing no this is what you're doing because you go into the deep dive this is like like a no filter thing there's no spin the long form the long form is gonna save us i see why you hate the tiktoks like a dopamine rush you know but they got a stupid tiktok i i saw five hours later i saw the resentment in your face i can't can't look away before like like those like thirty seconds i do four hours i mean both have a place both are exciting and you know yeah but i i can't it is very dangerous like because you can't look away yeah and i almost never maybe i'm doing it wrong but i almost never feel better ever after having used tiktok mixtwo of us i can't i cannot i cannot i have a team by the way i give my my my my my password to like a team i don't even go there because i went i was in a dark night very late at night i went tiktok and it was like two hours what yeah what i said oh no no no this is dangerous i'm i'm i'm i'm really like an instagram and facebook guy i don't need that leave it there and i barely get out of twitter i mean like x i don't i can't x is a cesspool x is just like two con the concentrated hate in the x is too much it's too much i can't so you you don't check it at all you try not to check it at all it is very intense i don't i don't i don't i don't i can't i can't i just like i post something and i run post and ghost so you're you're doing comedy here in the united states right now yes joe rogan has the the comedy mothership which is an incredible club have you considered doing that club i would love to i mean i do you know joe of course no who who does a new joe i mean i feel like it's a small world of comedy that's why i no i i think like joe joe's story was like what he did and stuff he that he did in the that did in the ufc and his podcast and it just it's it's very impressive the fact that he's there and he's bringing all of those people whether in comedy or his podcast is very impressive and this is what what this is the this is what is the media is all about what is like the internet is all about to give you the experiences of stuff that you might never experience mhmm and that is very important i mean you do it with people well like you go into their brains mhmm he goes take people and they they take their experiences and their and their lives and their story it is very interesting interesting and this is the beauty of of of that art form because you have all of these experiences at the tips of your hands and it is there for you to learn from you know and and what he's doing like i'm from you know and and what he's doing like when he moved to texas and we did the the comedy mothership anybody who would like push comedy forward that is the most difficult art form and the most demanding and the fact that you do that and he might not even be making money out of it but he doing that because of his passion that is enough yeah he's he's the he really believes in creating this like place where comedians could be really free and one of the cool things about the comedy mothership is like comedian is king there yeah like they're we have to like we have to bow down to the because you know the comedian who came there came after like eating shit yeah eating shit out there everywhere else if you pit you are basically you're a saint i have eaten shit from everywhere now i'm gonna give you shit ah it's great you already told me what you think about the state of politics in the united states but now tell me what you really think what what do you think of the choice of trump versus biden how do we end up here i don't know man i mean like the fact that like you have two people over the age of ninety yeah it is i think it's over a hundred but that's alright so combined like a hundred and seventy it is so sad it is so sad that this is what we can produce as as a society like like a demagogue and a sleepy joe i yeah he's he's too he's he's not there man he's he's gone he's gone i mean he could you know like when old people could be like a danger for themselves he's a danger for the whole world i mean like the whole world can like if if if if an old person would die he would like you know have like a hip replacement we can need them at like a new planet because of one decision it's but it's not just that it's not that it's what are when i came here listen i am i'm a i'm a democrat i always like and i told you like i i vote for bernie sanders i i i i like i i supported him like two thousand sixteen but i couldn't vote then and of course a huge fan of obama and one of my things is like he's the first muslim president it's like but he killed muslims like that's things muslims do but anyways i love that line and it just i i i think the the the the the whole idea like my shock is i i i told you about like what what biden said about like i'm a zionist okay we are zionist but then like jews are not safe in anywhere other than israel like dude what the hell are you saying and if you don't care about me and you don't care about my misery why would i care about you winning or losing you know and i have a joke that i told people like why would even biden listen to us he just raised hundred and forty five million dollars in california alone from pro israeli groups i mean what what can we arabs working in the vape business do to him yeah it's like we cannot compete with that yeah i mean like practically i mean it's like life is like life is unfair the guy is a politician he needs bills to pay he needs a campaign to run he needs money he will go to the people who will give him money joe biden is the highest paid politician from israel lobbies four point six million dollars over the years yeah but i also believe in great leaders that go against all of that but unfortunately you know bernie sanders was like that bernie sanders yes but also age i don't wanna be ageist of course no no you're like because i i remember listening to bernie sanders twenty years ago on tom hartman show and i don't wanna say anything against bernie but like he was sharper then of course there's a thing with age where of course no i i i i think i'm a huge fan about like putting limits on your working years because you don't wanna have like a mitch mcconnell moment every now because now the whole thing got like what is this isn't this not like a a house by a scare home it just it it it is unfair it is unfair and that the whole idea that you have like unlimited like you have a limit for the president but you don't have limit for congresspeople and and senators that's what do you mean this is basically you can go in and and and be in in in governance for forever and you know the longer that you can get the more corrupt you will get yes that that's the thing is very concerning for americans everybody everybody becomes corrupt after effort i mean that's why two terms is a good limit for everybody yeah and you know maybe half a term for for egyptian leaders well you know our half term is fifteen years quarter term you should come back on offer for for office there oh my god no no there's a curse in egyptian of egyptian presidency nobody nobody comes there like he's like dead or in jail yeah it's it's not the most appealing job they might make a statue of you though make you look good after my death i look very good dad you look that you yeah when when you look at what happened with navalny since you kind of really thought about this in egypt what happened with navalny in russia what do you think about that yeah but what happened in navalny in russia is not something new in russia i mean putin have like this whole history of poisoning and killing people and it's kind of like pretty much he's i i i would have to cite credit putin he's like bringing us the essence essence of the dark ages the middle ages it's like you know we know like basically putin is like is the living example of what happens if game of thrones was reality it's like death by poison like i blow up a plane it's like mysteriously disappears it is so i it it is it is very dark but it's like wow it's like a it's it's it's a it's a it's a television show maybe that's what attracts us to that part of the world is that it's so much on display this game of of power of geopolitics yeah of war no but the same happens in the west but i'm behind closed doors it's not that open that's open it's not it's not it's not that pronounced you know it's like oh oops epstein again yeah it's like we just like i think i think because of the west is more advanced like in movies and cinemas we kind of direct it better yeah and i think i think the outcome is like the way that you kind of like set the scene it's like scene and scene that's why people are about like landing on the moon they're like i get it but you know we haven't gone back they're too flat i mean alright if we zoom out do you think there will always be war in the world yeah always be suffering yes yeah but here's the thing i don't think for long i don't think that will happen for long wait a minute yeah yeah because here's the thing humanity is destined to to have war especially it will have war but something happened in the last fifty years we have now we have much more lethal weapons mhmm the problem is the beginning it's like swords against swords horses cavalry like cannons catapults meat and meat size but now you're like we're like you know like a press of a button you can annihilate the whole planet yeah and this is the problem wars will all continue the problem is when is gonna be the tipping point where we are actually going to destroy ourselves and it is so easy now to destroy ourselves the amount of weapons and the the quality of weapons that we have it is designed to kill more effectively more more more it just it is crazy it's like we can create our own destruction on ourself and and and i think we're not that far away from it just looking at nuclear weapons the fascinating thing about nuclear weapons is i've gotten to learn recently just how few people are involved in a full on nuclear war that kills basically kills everybody yeah well three plus billion people right away and the consequences of the nuclear winter it's unlivable but all it takes is i mean one president can do it so it could be even a false alarm misunderstanding like what happened in the cuba missile crisis but again and now there's more nations are prepared and ready to launch yeah i don't know and and and you have a media and a twenty four hours kind of like thing that makes you like at edge the whole time that's crazy there's a dark perspective on this where there's certain members of the media that would kind of enjoy the prospect of nuclear war like a little bit just just let's get as close to it as possible you have another factor that will contribute to that religion and remember how like the radical islamist talk about like the end of time and whatever but like most of the islamic don't have that much power problem is with christian zionists now being on the top of the world with america they have been pushing for that kind of conflict to kind of escalate escalate listen to sarah palin it's like god wants us here like karl rove all of the new gods the dispensationalist reagan there's an incredible book called like forcing the hands of gods beautiful book i read this like it's published nineteen ninety eight but it still matters today the whole idea about like especially the the zionist christians who love israel but they hate the jews they're antisemite but they love israel because of its role this is all basically formed because of the interpretation of the bible of scofield and how they talk about the end of time the armageddon and then the late great planet earth and then left behind sirius and all of that it's all about like we're heading to armageddon the problem is islam has there are people that believe that they're israel happy that those people are using it for the end of time and then the whole idea about them pushing as many weapons and troops and people in the middle east to be there for the nuclear holocaust and john hagee one of the of the pastors talk about that about the brimstones and it's gonna be a nuclear holocaust all of that people it's crazy how people are so despising life that they are wanting death so now you you all would have these revelations but these revelations mean nothing if you don't have an effective weapon in order to make it happen and this is the crazy thing and i'm worried that that that the end is going to be by someone that wants to meet god a little bit earlier somebody who's really in a hurry mhmm well i have good news for you maybe we'll become a multiplanetary species maybe elon musk will will lead us lead the way if you get out in space maybe he's one of them it's a secret lizard i asked you offline to not mention the lizard people they they are there's like a whole people that believe in the lizard people it's crazy i actually actually have to be honest i haven't fully looked into the lizard people i probably should you should yeah well maybe i'm afraid of the truth then then then then then then then i'm removing my by moving my face yeah i mean what so let's say let's say you're wrong about the end of the world and we it all turns out great and humanity flourishes why would that happen what what gives you hope for that trajectory for humanity younger people the people of tiktok that you don't like i i i yeah there is a lot of like bullshit there you know after you saying this people just keep sending you tiktok videos these younger people you're not gonna be that they'll they'll be this woman showing her boobs that that woman that's gonna save us that that alright boss thank you no there's like i think there is a wealth of it you know remember like the joke they said like we thought that like when we have internet we're gonna have like be more you know more informed and now we we we're watching twerking videos and that is true but on the other side the fact that you have the in availability of information i'm i'm learning a lot and there's people who are using that platform that it's not the majority because you know it's not very interesting and exciting but i think there's there might be a tipping point where there's enough people that would be aware and maybe they would collectively do something in order to bring back the power to the small man and maybe it sounds very naive maybe it's fine but we don't know we don't know because we you have already seen the legacy media and the legacy politicians shaking in the past few months they're getting nervous they're getting nervous because people are calling them out and those people were like hiding behind their desk behind in their office and not like not holding a house for that but like people now are calling them out and it is not gonna happen like this year or next year but i think it's something what advice would you give to those young folks i will never give advice to those people get off tiktok i know i will never i will never because like their input is different than mine yeah but like there's there's one thing i learned when people told me did the revolution fail in egypt did people that the people i was like listen the revolution is not an event it's not like hey we go in we topple the government it's not a revolution a revolution is a process it's a very long process and maybe the pro that process i mean as much as we don't like what happened in the arab world but the people there the awareness that happened and the discussions that have been opened that you didn't even imagine what happened in the middle east is happening and maybe the beginning of any any hope of change is that people start talking speaking out talking about stuff they were not allowed to speak about like for example israel the revolution continues ah yes boston you're you're a beautiful human being it's truly a pleasure and honor to meet you i could just feel the love radiating from you i hope i get to see you perform live i hope to get to see you many more times thank you for being who

listening to this conversation with bassem youssef to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you some words from john stewart the press can hold this magnifying glass up to our problems bringing them into focus illuminating issues heretofore unseen or they can use that magnifying glass to light ants on fire and then perhaps host a week of shows on the sudden unexpected dangerous flaming ant epidemic if we amplify everything we hear nothing thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
