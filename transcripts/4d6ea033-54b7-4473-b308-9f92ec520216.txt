the following is a conversation with sarah walker her third time in this podcast she is an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist interested in the origin of life and in discovering alien life on other worlds she has written an amazing new upcoming book titled life as no one knows it the physics of life's emergence this book is coming out on august sixth so please go preorder it now it will blow your mind and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this podcast we got notion for notes motifik for llm deployment shopify for ecommerce betterhelp for mental health and age you one for delicious delicious multivitamin drink choose wisely my friends also if you want to get in touch with me or to work with our amazing team go to lex freeman dot com slash contact and now onto the full ad reads no ads in the middle i try to make these interesting but if you skip them please still check out the sponsors i enjoy their stuff maybe you will too this episode is brought to you by notion a note taking and team collaboration tool i've been using it recently for note taking on academic papers specifically machine learning papers and there's a lot of machine learning papers and it's straight up just a great note taking tool but beyond that it's a great collaboration tool for the note taking process and the whole project management life cycle so it combines note taking wiki's project management and then there's an ai assistant that can summarize everything and anything and you could ask questions across all of those things so it's not just for a single document across all of the documents and obviously people are collaborating on those documents so you can ask questions what did this person do what is the status of this project so on so forth it's just a really nice integration of llms this is the fun about the question with llms how do you leverage the obvious power that they possess to be useful to whatever tasks that we do like what is the actual product here and so notion leverages them extremely well where the product is team collaboration on notes wikis and project management so really well done love to support people that do a great job of building a great software product try notion ai for free when you go to notion dot com slash lex that's all lowercase notion dot com slash lex to try the power of notion ai today this episode is brought to you by a new sponsor motifik it's a saas platform that helps businesses deploy lms and in general generative ai that are customized with rag retrieval augmented generation on organizational data sources obviously these kinds of data sources are often super sensitive and that's where motifik comes in they help companies with security and compliance a little background here since i had to do the deep dive myself a while back motifik is created by cisco specifically cisco's outshift group and outshift is doing cutting edge r and d stuff in cisco so cisco has very very very long track record and reputation of working with giant businesses and helping him out and not messing stuff up when you're dealing with sensitive data and when you're dealing with businesses that make a lot of money and already have products that bring in a lot of money and a lot of people rely on you don't wanna mess stuff up i think specifically this task of taking organizational data that's private to the company that has to remain very secure it's very sensitive data using the power of llms and search via the rag framework on that data is super super powerful i think companies that do this well and quickly which is what modify helps with will win because the productivity gains nobody knows but i don't think there's a ceiling so it pays us off to play with llms but do so in a secure way visit motifik ai to learn more that's m o t i f i c dot a i this episode is also brought to you by shopify a platform designed for anyone to sell anywhere with a great looking online store i have a site set up black streamer dot com slash store has a few shirts on it took a few minutes to set up super easy they integrate third party apps i did that for the on demand printing so i don't have to think about any of that all you do is upload the design the shirts are sold and shipped it's kind of an interesting experiment for me to understand how people look at you when you have a t shirt with nothing on it and a t shirt with something on it especially if that something is recognizable so if i have jimi hendrix or a pink floyd shirt or johnny cash or a metallica shirt there's going to be certain people that look at me with recognition and respect and almost like they wanna start a conversation with me when i have a t shirt like a black t shirt with nothing on it that kind of look doesn't happen if i went out more i would take a notebook and actually make this a little bit more rigorous but anyway there's definitely a noticeable social effect that happens when you have a t shirt with a cool thing on it so i'm really happy with all the creators that are using shopify to sell cool t shirts i wish there was a better discovery process though i'm always in search of buying cool t shirts like i just on instagram i think there was a advertisement for a set of t shirts for classic movies and that was really badass but i scrolled past it and i i regret it see that's like a piece of advertisement that actually works but i wish there's a way to not take me from the scrolling experience or maybe a way to bookmark it really naturally there's already a natural sort of skepticism about advertisement but here it worked so like when advertisement's done well it it it works i just wish i saved it but anyway hopefully they use shopify to sell shirts if they don't they should and if you're thinking of selling shirts use shopify also sign up for a one dollar per month trial period at shopify dot com slash luxe that's all lowercase go to shopify dot

movie that's a cool setting because i've been thinking about interviewing directors and actors more and more and the setting of a couple's therapy is really interesting it's a really interesting dynamic between a man and woman and a therapist and them trying to sort of make explicit the implicit drama that's been boiling over in their relationship obviously there's the therapist one on one relationship is really interesting on film good will hunting with robin williams man what a great great performance i miss that guy so much what a truly special human being anyway back in the real

brought to you by ag one an all in one daily drink to support better health and peak performance i drink it every day multiple times a day sometimes usually after a run like i'm gonna go for a run-in a little bit it's already that texas heat it's warming up it's warming up it's creeping up on the hundred degree weather and i love it i don't care the hotter it is the tougher the run the more of a mental test it is and what i do is i speed up take that feeling of discomfort and allow myself to sit in it and visualize that feeling with discomfort fading so from a third person perspective it's just a feeling and a feeling can be controlled a feeling can be ignored a feeling could be morphed from the negative to the positive so for me it's not just a meditative practice of letting go of all feelings and focusing on the breath for me it is also being able to control that discomfort and letting go of that discomfort the feeling and the notion of discomfort even when on the surface there should be a lot of physical discomfort because physical discomfort is first and foremost a construction of the mind it's not real it's not real as long as you believe it's not real it's not real and that's what i do but when i get back home extremely exhausted and uncomfortable having overcome that challenge i put an ag one in the freezer for like thirty minutes it has this great consistency and then after a shower i just take the drink and celebrate having overcome something difficult they'll give you one month supply of fish oil when you sign up at drink a g one dot com slash lex this is a lex freedom podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's sarah walker you open the book life as no one knows it the physics of life's emergence with a distinction between the materialists and the vitalists so what's the difference can you maybe define the two i think the question there is about whether life can be described in terms of matter and you know physical things or whether there is some other feature that's not physical that actually animates living things so for a long time people maybe have called that a soul it's been really hard to pin down what that is so i think the vitalist idea is really that it's it's kind of a dualistic interpretation that there's sort of the material properties but there's something else that animates life that is there when you're alive and it's not there when you're dead and materialists kind of don't think that there's anything really special about the matter of life and the material substrates that life is made out of so they disagree on some really fundamental points is there a gray area between the two like maybe all there is is matter but there's so much we don't know that it might as well be magic that that like whatever that magic that the vitalists see meaning like there's just so much mystery that it's really unfair to say that it's boring and understood and as simple as quote unquote physics yeah i think the entire universe is just a giant mystery i guess that's what motivates me as a scientist and so oftentimes when i look at open problems like the nature of life or consciousness or you know what is intelligence or are there souls or whatever whatever question that we have that we feel like we aren't even on the tip of answering yet i think you know we have a lot more work to do to really understand the answers to these questions so it's not magic it's just the unknown and i think a lot of the history of humans coming to understand the world around us has been taking ideas that we once thought were magic or supernatural and really understanding them in a much deeper way that we learn what those things are and they still have an air of mystery even when we understand them there's there's no there's no sort of bottom to our understanding so do you think the vitalists have a point that they're more eager and able to notice the magic of life i think that no tradition vitalists included is ever fully wrong about the nature of the things that they're describing so a lot of times when i look at different ways that people have described things across human history across different cultures there's always a seed of truth in them and i think it's really important to try to look for those because if there are narratives that humans have been telling ourselves for thousands of years for thousands of generations there must be some truth to them we've been learning about reality for a really long time and we recognize the patterns that reality presents us we don't always understand what those patterns are and so i think it's really important to pay attention to that so i don't think the finalists were actually wrong and a lot of what i talk about in the book but also i think about a lot just professionally is the nature of our definitions of what's material and how science has come to invent the concept of matter and that some of those things actually really are inventions that happened in a particular time in a particular technology that could learn about certain patterns and help us understand them and that there are some patterns we still don't understand and if we knew how to measure those things or we knew how to describe them in a more rigorous way we would realize that the material world matter has more properties than we thought that it did and one of those might be associated with the thing that we call life life could be a material property and still have a lot of the features that the vitalist thought were mysterious so we may still expand our understanding what is incorporated in the category of matter that will eventually incorporate such magical things that the vitalists have noticed yeah like life yeah so i think about i always like to use examples from physics so i'll probably do that to like like it's just my it's my go to place but you know in in the history of gravitational physics for example in the history of motion you know like when aristotle came up with his theories of motion he did it by the material properties he thought things had so there was a concept of things falling to earth because they were solid like and things raising to the heavens because they were air like and things moving around the planet because they were celestial like but then we came to realize that thousands of years later and after the invention of many technologies that allowed us to actually measure time in a mechanistic way and track planetary motion and we could you know roll balls down and climb planes and track that progress we realized that if we just talked about mass and acceleration we could unify all motion in the universe in a really simple description so we didn't really have to worry about the fact that my cup is heavy and the air is light like the same laws describe them if we have the right material properties to talk about what those laws are actually interacting with and so i think the issue with life is we don't know how to think about information in a material way and so we haven't been able to build a unified description of what life is or the kind of things that evolution builds because we haven't really invented the right material concept yet so when talking about motion the laws of physics appear to be the same everywhere out in the universe do you think the same is true for other kinds of matter that we might eventually include life in i think life obeys universal principles i think there is some deep underlying explanatory framework that will tell us about the nature of life in the universe and will allow us to identify life that we can't yet recognize because it's too different you're right about the paradox of defining life why does it seem to be so easy and so complicated at the same time you know all the sort of classic definitions people want to use just don't work they don't work in all cases so carl sagan had this wonderful essay on definitions of life where i think he talks about aliens coming from another planet if they saw earth they might think that cars were the dominant life form because there's so many of them on our planet and like humans are inside them and you might wanna exclude machines but any definition you know like classic biology textbook definitions would also include them and so you know he wanted to draw a boundary between these kind of things by trying to exclude them but they were naturally included by the definitions people wanna give and in fact what he ended up pointing out is that all of the definitions of life that we have whether it's life is a self reproducing system or life eats to survive or life requires compartments whatever it is there's always a counterexample that challenges that definition this is why viruses are so hard or why fire is so hard and so we've had a really hard time trying to pin down from a a definitional perspective exactly what life is yeah you actually bring up the the zombie and fungus i enjoyed looking at this thing as an example one of the challenges you seem i mentioned viruses but this this is a parasite look at that did you see this in the jungle infects ants actually one of the interesting things about the jungle everything is ephemeral like everything eats everything really quickly so if you if an organism dies that organism disappears is it yeah it's a machine that doesn't have i wanted to say it doesn't have a memory or a history which is interesting given your work on history in defining a living being the jungle forgets very quickly it wants to erase the fact that you existed very quickly yeah but it can't erase it it's just and i think the other thing that is really you know vivid to me about this example that you're giving is how much death is necessary for life so i i worry a bit about notions of immortality and whether immortality is a good thing or not so i have sort of a broad conception that life is the only thing the universe generates that actually has even the potential to be immortal but that's as like the sort of process that you're describing where life is about memory and historical contingency and construction of new possibilities but when you look at any instance of life especially one as dynamic as what you're describing it's a constant birth and death process but that birth and death process is like the way that the universe can explore what possibilities can exist and not everything not every possible human or every possible ant or every possible zombie ant or every possible tree will ever live so it's you know it's an incredibly dynamic and creative place because of all that death so does this thing this is a parasite that needs the ant so is this a living thing or is this not a living thing so this is yeah so it just pierces the ant i mean it it right and i've seen a lot of this by the way organisms working together in the jungle like ants protecting a delicious piece of fruit so they need the fruit but like if you touch that fruit they're going to like the forces emerge they're fighting you they're defending that fruit right to the death it's just nature seems to find mutual benefits right yeah it does i i think the thing that's perplexing for me about these kind of examples is you know effectively the ant's dead but it's staying alive now because it's piloted by this fungus mhmm and so that gets back to this you know thing that we're talking about a few minutes ago about how the boundary of life is really hard to define so you know anytime that you wanna draw a boundary around something and you say this feature is the thing that makes us alive or this thing is alive on its own there's not ever really a clear boundary and these kind of examples are really good at showing that because it it's like the thing that you would have thought is the living organism is now dead except that it has another living organism that's piloting it so the two of them together are alive in some sense but they're you know now in this kind of weird symbiotic relationship that's taking this ant to its death so what do you do with that in terms of when you try to define life i think we have to get rid of the notion of an individual as being relevant and this is really difficult because you know a lot of the ways that we think about life like the fundamental unit of life is the cell individuals are alive but we don't think about how how gray that distinction is so for example you might consider you know self reproduction to be the most defining feature of life a lot of people do actually like it's you know one of these standard different definitions that a lot of people may feel like to use in astrobiology is life is a self sustaining chemical system capable of darwinian evolution which i was once quoted as agreeing with and i was really offended because i hate that definition i think it's terrible and i think it's terrible that people use it i think like every word in that definition is actually wrong as a descriptor of life life is a self sustaining chemical system capable of darwinian evolution why is that that seems like a pretty good i know if you wanna make me angry you can pretend i said that and believed it so self sustaining chemical system darwinian evolution what is self sustaining what's what what's so frustrating i mean which aspect is frustrating to you but it's also those are very interesting words yeah they're all interesting words and you know together they sound really smart and they sound like they box in what life is but you can use any of this any of the words individually and you can come up with counterexamples that don't fulfill that property the self sustaining one is really interesting thinking about humans right like we're not self sustaining we're dependent on societies and so you know i find it paradoxical that you know it might be that societies because their self sustaining units are now more alive than individuals are and that could be the case but i still think we have some property associated with life i mean that's the thing that we're trying to describe so that one's quite hard and in general you know no organism is really self sustaining they always require an environment so being self sustaining is coupled in some sense to the world around you we don't live in a vacuum so so that part's already challenging and then you can go to chemical system i don't think that's good either i think there's a confusion because life emerges in chemistry that life is chemical i don't think life is chemical i think life emerges in chemistry because chemistry is the first thing the universe builds where it cannot exhaust all the possibilities because the combinatorial space of chemistry is too large well but is it possible to have a life that is not a chemical system yes there's a guy i know named lee cronin he's been on the podcast a couple times he just got really pissed off listening to this he probably just got really pissed off hearing that i thought people would somehow don't know he's a chemist yeah but he would agree with that statement would he i don't think he would i don't think he would he would broaden the definition of chemistry until it would include everything oh sure okay so you or maybe i don't know but wait but you said that universe that's the first thing it creates is chemistry we're the very precisely it's not the first thing it creates obviously like it has to make atoms first but it's the first thing like if you think about you know the universe originated atoms were made in you know big bang nuclear synthesis and then later in stars and then planets formed and planets become engines of chemistry they start exploring what kind of chemistry is possible and the combinatorial space of chemistry is so large that even on every planet in the entire universe you will never express every possible molecule i like this example actually that that lee gave me which is to think about taxol it has a molecular weight of about eight fifty three it's got you know a lot of atoms but it's not astronomically large and if you try to make one molecule with that molecular formula and every three-dimensional shape you could make with that molecular formula it would fill one point five universes in volume so the with one unique molecule mhmm that's just one molecule so chemical space is huge and i think it's really important to recognize that because if you wanna ask a question of why does life emerge in chemistry well life emerges in chemistry because life is the physics of how the universe selects what gets to exist and those things get created along historically contingent pathways and memory and all the other stuff that we can talk about but the universe has to actually make historically contingent choices in chemistry because it can't exhaust all possible molecules what kind of things can you create that's outside the the combinatorial space of chemistry that's what i'm trying to understand oh if it's not chemical so i think some of the things that have evolved on our biosphere i would call as much alive as chemistry as a cell but they seem much more abstract so for example i think language is alive i think or at least life i think memes are i think you're saying language is life yeah language is alive oh boy i'm gonna have to explore that one okay but life maybe not maybe not alive but i don't i actually don't know where i stand exactly on that i've been thinking about that a little bit more lately but mathematics too and it's interesting because people think that math has this platonic reality that exists outside of our universe and i think it's a feature of our biosphere and it's telling us something about the structure of ourselves and i find that really interesting because when you would sort of internalize all of these things that we notice about the world and you start asking well what do these look like if i was you know something outside of myself observing these systems that we're all embedded in what would that structure look like and i think we look really different than the way that we talk about what we look like to each other what do you think a living organism in math is is it one axiomatic system or is it individual theorems or is it i think it's the fact that it's open ended in some sense it's it's another open ended combinatorial space and the recursive properties of it allow creativity to happen which is what you see with you know like the revolution in the last century with godel's theorem and turing and you know there's there's clear places where mathematics notices holes in the universe so it seems like you're sneaking up a different kind of definition of life open ended large combinatorial space yeah room for creativity definitely not chemical i mean chemistry is one substrate to chem yeah chemical okay what about the third thing which i think will be the the hardest because you probably like it the most is evolution or selection well specifically it's darwinian evolution and i think darwinian evolution is a problem but the reason that that definition is a problem is not because evolution is in the definition but because the implication is that you know that peep most people would wanna make is that an individual is alive and the evolutionary process at least the darwinian evolutionary process and most evolutionary processes they don't happen at the level of individuals they happen at the level of population so again you would be saying something like what we saw with the self sustaining definition which is that populations are alive but individuals aren't because populations evolve and individuals don't and obviously like maybe you're alive because you know your gut microbiome is evolving but lex as an entity right now is not evolving by canonical theories of evolution in assembly theory which is attempting to explain life evolution is a much broader thing so so an an individual organism can evolve under assembly theory yes you're constructing yourself all the time assembly theory is about construction and how the universe selects for things to exist what if you reformulate everything like a population is a living organism so that's fine too right but but this again gets back to so so i think what all of the you know like we can nitpick at definitions i don't think it's like incredibly helpful to do it but the reason for for me fun yeah it is fun it is really fun and actually i do i do think it's useful in the sense that when you see the way the ways that they all break down you either have to keep forcing in your like sort of conception of life you want to have or you have to say all these definitions are breaking down for a reason maybe i should adopt a more expansive definition that encompasses all the things that i think in our life and so for me i think life is the process of how information structures matter over time and space and an example of life is what emerges on a planet and yields an open ended cascade of generation of structure and increasing complexity and this is the thing that life is and any individual is just a particular instance of these lineages that are you know structured across time and so we focus so much on these individuals that are these short temporal moments in this larger causal structure that actually is the life on our planet and i think that's why these definitions break down because they're not general enough they're not universal enough they're not deep enough they're not abstract enough to actually capture that regularity because we're focused on those that little ephemeral thing that we fall through in life aristotle focusing on you know heavy things falling because they're earth like and you know things floating because they're air like it's the wrong thing to focus on so what what exactly are we missing by focusing on such a short span of time i think we're missing most of what we are so one of the issues i've been thinking about this all like really viscerally lately it's weird when you do theoretical physics because i think it like literally changes the structure of your brain and you see the world differently especially when you're trying to build new abstractions do you think it's possible if you're a theoretical physicist that like it's easy to fall off the cliff and go descend into madness i mean i think you're always on the edge of it but i think what is amazing about being a scientist and trying to do things rigorously is it keeps your sanity so i think if i wasn't a theoretical physicist i would i would be probably not sane right but what it forces you to do is hold the like you have to hold yourself to the fire of like these abstractions in my mind have to really correspond to reality and i have to really test that all the time and so i love building new abstractions and i love going to those like incredibly creative you know spaces that people don't see as part of the way that we understand the world now but ultimately i have to make sure that whatever i'm pulling from that space is something that's really usable and really like relates to the world outside of me that's what science is so we were talking about what we're missing when we look at a small stretch of time in a small stretch of space yeah so the issue is we evolve perception to see reality a certain way right so for us space is really important and time feels fleeting and i i you know i i had a really wonderful mentor paul davies most of my career and paul's amazing because he gives these like little seed thought experiments all the time like you know something he used to ask me all the time was when i was a postdoc this is kind of a random tangent but was like you know how much of the universe be could be converted into technology if you were thinking about like you know long term futures and stuff like that and it's like a weird thought experiment but like there's a lot of deep things there i do think a lot about the fact that we're really limited in our interactions with reality by the particular architectures that we evolve and so we're not seeing everything and in fact our technology tells us this all the time because it allows us to see the world in new ways by basically allowing us to perceive the world in ways that we couldn't otherwise and so what i'm getting at with this is i think that living objects are actually huge like they're some of the biggest structures in the universe but they are not big in space they are big in time and we actually can't resolve that feature we don't interact with it on a regular basis so we see them as these fleeting things that have this really short temporal clock time without seeing how large they are when i'm saying time here i really like the way that people could picture it is in terms of causal structure so if you think about the history of the universe to get to you and you imagine that that entire history is you that is the i the picture i have in my mind when i look at every living thing so you have a you have a tweet for everything you tweeted doesn't everyone you have a lot of poetic profound tweets sometimes you they're puzzles that take a long time to figure out well you know what it is the trick is the reason they're hard to write is because it's compressing a very deep idea into a short amount of space and i really like doing that intellectual exercise because i find it productive for me yeah it's a very interesting kind of compression algorithm though yeah i like language i think it's really fun to play with yeah i wonder if ai can decompress it that'd be interesting i i i would like to try this but i think i use language in certain ways that are non canonical and i do it very purposefully and it would be interesting to me how ai would interpret it yeah your tweets would be a good turing test for this for for superintelligence anyway you tweeted that things only look emergent be because we can't see time mhmm so if we could see time what would the world look like you're saying you'll be able to see everything that an object has been every step of the way that led to this current moment and all the interactions that required to make that evolution happen you would see this gigantic tail the universe is far larger in time than it is in space yeah and this planet is one of the biggest things in the universe oh so the more complexity the bigger yeah so like the yeah tech technosphere i think the the modern technosphere is the largest object in time in the universe that we know about and when you say technosphere what do you mean i mean the global integration of life and technology on this planet so all the things all the technological things were created mhmm but i don't think of them as separate they're like very integrated with the structure that generated them so you can almost imagine it like time is constantly bifurcating and it's generating new structures and these new structures are you know locally constructing the future and so things like you and i are very close together in time because we didn't diverge like very early in the history of the universe it's very recent and i think this is one of the reasons that we can understand each other so well and we can communicate effectively and i might have some sense of what it feels like to be you but you know other organisms bifurcated from us in time earlier this is just the concept of phylogeny right but if you take that deeper and you really think about that as the structure of the physics that generates life and you take that very seriously all of that causation is is still bundled up in the objects we observe today and so so you and i are are close in this temporal structure but we're also and we're so close because we're really big and we only are very different in sort of like the most recent moments in the time that's like embedded in us it's hard to use words to visualize what's in minds i have such a hard time with this sometimes i'm like i like i actually was thinking on the way over here i was like like you know you have pictures in your brain and then they're hard to put into words but i realized i always say i have a visual but it's not actually i have a visual it's i have a feeling because oftentimes i cannot actually draw a picture in my mind for the things that i say but sometimes they go through a picture before they get to words but i like experimenting with words because i think they help paint pictures yes it's again some kind of compressed feeling that you can query to get a a sense of the bigger visualization that you have in mind it's a real it's just got a really nice compression but i think the idea of this object that in it contains all the information about the history of an entity that you see now just trying to visualize that is pretty cool yeah it's i mean obviously the mind breaks down quickly as you step seconds and minutes back in time but for sure i i guess it's just a gigantic object yeah we're supposed to be thinking about yeah i think so and i think this is one of the reasons that we have such an ability of to abstract as humans because we are so gigantic that like the space that we can go back into is really large so like the more abstract you're going like the deeper you're going in that space but in that sense aren't we fundamentally all connected yes and this is why the the definition of life cannot be the individual it has to be these lineages because they're all connected they're interwoven and they're exchanging parts all the time yeah so that maybe there's certain aspects of those lineages that can be lifelike they can be characteristics they can be measured like with the theory that yeah more or less life but they're all just fingertips of a of a much bigger object yeah i think life is very high dimensional and in fact i think you can be alive in some dimensions and and not in others like if you could if you could project all the causation that's in you in some in some features of you you know very little causation is required and like very little history and in some features a lot is so it's quite difficult to take this really high dimensional very deep structure and project it into things that we really can understand and say like this is the one thing that we're seeing because it's not one thing it's funny we're talking about this now and i'm slowly starting to realize one of the things i saw when i took ayahuasca afterwards actually so the actual ceremony is four or five hours but afterwards you're still riding whatever the thing that you're riding and i got a chance to afterwards hang out with some friends and just shoot the shit in the you know in the forest and i get to see their faces and what was happening with their faces and their hair is i would get this interesting effect first of all everything was beautiful and and i just had so much love for everybody but i could see their past selves like behind them it was this effect where i guess it's a blurring effect of where like if i move like this the faces that were just there are still there and it would just float like this these behind them which will create this incredible effect but it's also another way to think about that is i'm visualizing a little bit of that object of the thing they wore just a few seconds ago yeah it's a cool little effect that's very cool and now it's like giving it a bit more profundity to to the effect that was just beautiful aesthetically but it's also beautiful from a physics perspective because that is a past self i get a little glimpse at the past selves that the they were but then you take that to its natural conclusion not just a few seconds ago but just to the beginning of the universe and you could probably get to that years yeah get down that lineage it's crazy that there's billions of years inside all of us all of us yeah and then we connect obviously yeah not too not too long ago yeah you you mentioned just the techno sphere and you also wrote that the most alive thing in this planet is our techno sphere yeah why is the technology we create a kind of life form why do you why are you seeing it as life because it's creative but with us obviously like not independently of us and also because of this sort of lineage view of life and i i think about life often as a planetary scale phenomena because that's sort of the natural boundary for all of this causation that's bundled in every object in our biosphere and so for me it's just sort of the current boundary of how far life on our planet has pushed into the things that our universe can generate and so it's the furthest thing it's the biggest thing and i think a lot about the nature of life across different scales and so you know we have cells inside of us that are alive and we feel like we're alive but we don't often think about the societies that we're embedded in as alive or a global scale organization of us and our technology on the planet as alive but i think if you have this deeper view into the nature of life which i think is necessary also to solve the origin of life then you have to include those things all of them she she had to simultaneously think about every single life at every single scale yeah the planetary and the bacteria level yeah this is the hard thing about solving the problem of life i think is how many things you have to integrate into building a sort of a a a unified picture of this thing that we wanna call life and and a lot of our theories of physics are built on building deep regularities that explain a really broad class of phenomenon i think we haven't really traditionally thought about life that way but i think to get it at some of these hardest questions like looking for life on other planets or the origin of life you really have to think about it that way and so most of like my professional work is just trying to understand like every single thing on this planet that might be an example of life which is pretty much everything and then trying to figure out like what's the deeper structure underlying that yeah schrodinger wrote that living matter while not alluding the laws of physics as established up to date is likely to involve other laws of physics here there are two unknown so to him i love that quote there was a sense that at the bottom of this there are new laws of physics that could explain this thing that we call life yeah schrodinger really tried to do what physicists try to do which is explain things and he his attempt was to try to explain life in terms of non equilibrium physics because he thought that was the best description that we could generate at the time and so he did come up with something really insightful which was to predict the structure of dna as an aperiodic crystal and that was for a very precise reason that you know that was the only kind of physical structure that could encode enough information to actually specify a cell we knew some things about genes but not about dna and its actual structure when he proposed that but in the book he tried to explain life is kind of going against entropy and so some people have talked about it as like schrodinger's paradox how can life persist when the second law of thermodynamics is there but in open systems that's not so problematic and really the question is why can life generate so much order and we don't have a physics to describe that and it's interesting you know generations of physicists have thought about this problem oftentimes it's like when people are retiring they're like oh now i can work on life or they're like more senior in their career and they worked on other more traditional problems and there's still a lot of impetus in the physics community to think that non equilibrium physics will explain life but i i think that's not the right approach i don't think ultimately the solution to what life is is there and i don't really think entropy has much to do with it unless it's entirely reformulated well because you have to explain how interesting order how complexity emerges from the soup yes from randomness from randomness physics currently can't do that no physics hardly even acknowledges that the universe is random at its base we like to think we live in a deterministic universe and everything's deterministic but i think that's probably you know an artifact of the way that we've written down laws of physics since newton invented modern physics in his conception of motion and gravity which you know he he formulated laws that had initial conditions and fixed dynamical laws and that's been sort of become the standard canon of how people think the universe works and how we need to describe any physical system is with an initial condition and a law of motion and i think that's not actually the way the universe really works i think it's a good approximation for the kind of systems that physicists have studied so far and i think it will radically fail in the long term at describing reality at its more basal levels i'm not i'm not saying there's a base i don't think that reality has a ground and i don't think there's a theory of everything but i think there are better theories and i think there are more explanatory theories and i think we can get to something that explains much more than the current laws of physics do when you say theory of everything you mean like everything everything yeah you know like in in physics right now it's really popular to talk about theories of everything so string theory is supposed to be a theory of everything because it unifies quantum mechanics and gravity and you know people have their different pet theories of everything and and the challenge with a theory of everything i really love this quote quote from david krakauer which is a theory of everything is a theory of everything except those things that theorize oh you mean removing the observer from the thing yeah but it's also it's also weird because if a theory of everything explained everything it should also explain the theory so the theory has to be recursive and none of our theories of physics are recursive so it's just a it's a it's a weird concept yeah but it's very difficult to integrate the observer into a theory i don't think so i think you can build a theory acknowledging that you're an observer inside the universe but it doesn't become recursive in that way and that's you you think it's possible to make a theory that's okay with that i think so i i mean i don't think there's always gonna be the paradox of another meta level you could build on the the meta level right so like if you assume this is your universe and you're the observer outside of it you have some meta description of that universe but then you need a meta description of you describing that universe right so you know this is one of the biggest challenges that we face being observers inside our universe and also you know why the paradoxes and the foundations of mathematics and any place that we try to have observers in the system or a system describing itself show up but i think it is possible to build a physics that builds in those things intrinsically without having them be paradoxical or have holes in the descriptions and so one one place i think about this quite a lot which i think can give you sort of a more concrete example is is the nature of like what we call fundamental so we typically define fundamental right now in terms of the smallest indivisible units of matter so again you have to have a definition of what you think material is and matter is but right now the you know what's fundamental are elementary particles and we think they're fundamental because we can't break them apart further and obviously we have theories like string theory that if they're right would replace the current description of what's the most fundamental thing in our universe by replacing it with something smaller but we can't get to those theories because we're technologically limited and so if you if you look at this from a historical perspective and you think about explanations changing as physical systems like us learn more about the reality in which they live we once considered atoms to be the most fundamental thing and you know it literally comes from the word indivisible and then we realized atoms had substructure because we built better technology which allowed us to quote unquote see the world better and resolve smaller features of it and then we built even better technology which allowed us to see even smaller structure and get down to the standard model particles and we think that there's might be structure below that but we can't get there yet with our technology so what's fundamental the way we talk about it in current physics is not actually fundamental it's the boundaries of what we can observe in our universe what we can see with our technology and so if you wanna build a theory that's about us and about what what's inside the universe that we can observe not what's at the boundary of it you need to talk about objects that are in the universe that you can actually break apart to smaller things i think the things that are fundamental are actually the constructed objects they're the ones that really exist and you really understand their properties because you know how the universe constructed them because you can actually take them apart you can understand the intrinsic laws that built them but the things at the boundary are just at the boundary they're evolving with us and we'll learn more about that structure as we go along but really if we wanna talk about what's fundamental inside our universe we have to talk about all these things that are traditionally considered emergent but really just structures in time that have causal histories that constructed them and you know are really actually what our universe is about so we should focus on the construction methodology as the fundamental thing do you think there's a bottom to the the smallest possible thing that makes up the universe i don't see one and you it'll take way too long it'll take longer to find that than it will to understand the mechanism that created life i think so yeah i i think for me the frontier in modern physics where the new physics lies is not in high energy particle physics it's not in quantum gravity it's not in any of these sort of traditionally sold this is gonna be the newest deepest insight we have into the nature reality it is going to be in studying the problems of life and intelligence and the things that are sort of also our current existential crises as a civilization or a culture that's going through you know an existential trauma of inventing technologies that we don't understand right now the existential trauma and the terror we feel that that technology might somehow destroy us us meaning living intelligent living organisms right yet we don't understand what that even means well humans have always been afraid of our technologies though right so it's kind of a fascinating thing that every time we invent something we don't understand it takes us a little while to catch up with it i think also in part humans kind of love being afraid yeah we love being traumatized it's weird we wanna learn more and then when we learn more it traumatizes us you know i never thought about it this before but i think this is one of the reasons i love what i do is because it traumatizes me all the time so it's really bad but what i mean is like i love the shock of like realizing that like coming to understand something in a way that you never understood it before i think it seems to me when when i see a lot of the ways other people react to new ideas that they don't feel that way intrinsically but for me that's like that's why i do what i do i i love i love that feeling but you're also working on a topic where it's fundamentally ego destroying because you're talking about like life it's humbling to think that we're not the individual human is not special yeah and you're like very viscerally exploring that yeah i'm trying to embody that because you i think you have to live the physics to understand it but there's a great quote about einstein i don't know if this is true or not that he once said that he could feel light like beam in his belly and i think but i think like you gotta think about it though right like you're if you're a really deep thinker and you're really thinking about reality that deeply and you are part of the reality that you're trying to describe like you feel it you really feel it that's what i was saying about you're always like walking along the cliff if you fall off you're falling into madness yes it's a constant constant descent in the madness the fascinating thing about physicists and madness is that you don't know if you've fallen off the cliff yeah i know you don't know that's that's the cool thing about it other people to tell me actually this is very funny because i like i have these conversations with my students often like they're worried about going crazy i have to like reassure them that like one of the reasons they'll stay sane is by trying to work on concrete problems going crazy or waking up i don't know which one it which one it is yeah so what do you think is the origin of life on earth and how can we talk about it in a productive way the origin of life is like this boundary that the universe can only cross if a structure that emerges can reinforce its own existence which is self reproduction autocatalysis things people traditionally talk about but it has to be able to maintain its own existence against this sort of randomness that happens in chemistry and this randomness that happens in the quantum world and like it's in some sense the emergence of like a deterministic structure that says you know i'm gonna exist and i'm gonna keep going but you know pinning that down is really hard we have ways of thinking about it in assembly theory that i think are pretty rigorous and one of the things i'm really excited about is trying to actually quantify in an assembly theoretic way when the origin of life happens but the basic process i have in mind is like a system that has no causal contingency no constraints of objects basically constraining the existence of other objects or forming or or allowing the existence of other objects and so that sounds very abstract but like you can just think of like a chemical reaction can't happen if there's not a catalyst for example or a baby can't be born if there wasn't a parent so there's a lot of causal contingency that's necessary for certain things to happen so you think about this sort of unconstrained random system there's nothing that reinforces the existence of other things so so those sort of resources just get washed out in all of these different structures and none of them exist again or they just you know they're they're not very complicated if they're in high abundance and some random events allow some things to start reinforcing the existence of a small subset of objects and if they can do that you know like just molecules basically recognizing each other and being able to catalyze certain reactions there's this kind of transition point that happens where unless you get a self reinforcing structure something that can maintain its own existence it actually can't cross this boundary to make any objects in high abundance without having this sort of past history that it's carrying with us and maintaining the existence of that past history and that boundary point where objects can't exist unless they have the selection and history in them is what we call the original life and pretty much everything beyond that boundary is holding on for dear life to all of the causation and causal structure that's basically put it there and it's carving its way through this possibility space into generating more and more structure and that's when you get the open ended cascade of evolution but that boundary point is really hard to cross and then what happens when you cross that boundary point and the way objects come into existence is also like really fascinating dynamics because you know like as things become more complex the assembly index increases i can explain all these things sorry you can tell me what you wanna explain i mean explain or or what people wanna will wanna hear this sorry i have like a very vivid visual on my brain and it's really hard to articulate it gotta convert it to language i know it's so hard it's not it's like it's going from like a feeling to a visual to language is so stifling similar i have to convert it yeah from language to to a visual yeah to a feeling yeah i think it's working i hope so i really like the self reinforcing objects i mean just just yeah just so i understand one way to create a lot of the same kind of object is make them self reinforcing yes so self reproduction has this property right like if a system can make itself then it can it can persist in time right because all objects decay they all have a finite life time so if you're able to make a copy of yourself before you die before the second law eats you or whatever people think happens then that structure can persist in time so that's a way to sort of emerge out of a random soup randomness of soup right but things that can copy themselves are very rare yeah and so what ends up happening is that you get structures that enable the existence of other things mhmm and then somehow only for some sets of objects you get closed structures that are self reinforcing and allow that entire structure to persist right so the one object a reinforces the existence of object b but you know object a can die yep so you have to like close that loop right so this is the classic very unlikely statistically but you know that's right sufficiently it's so you're saying there's a chance there is a chance probability and then but once you solve that once you close the loop you can create a lot of those objects and that's what we're trying to figure out is what are the causal constraints that close the loop so there is this idea that's been in the literature for a really long time that was originally proposed by stuart kaufman as really critical to the origin of life called autocadlock set so autocatalytic set is exactly this property we have a makes b b makes c c makes a and you get a closed system but the problem with the theory of autocatalytic sets is incredibly brittle as a theory and it requires a lot of ad hoc assumptions like you have to assume function you have to say this thing makes b it's not an emergent property the association between a and b and so the way i think about it is much more general if you think about these histories that make objects it's it's kind of like the structure of the histories becomes collapses in such a way that these things are all in the same sort of causal structure and that causal structure actually loops back on itself to be able to generate some of the things that make the higher level structures lee has a beautiful example of this actually in molybdenum it's like the first nonorganic autocatalytic set it's a self reproducing molybdenum ring but it's like like molybdenum and and basically like if you look at the molybdenum it it makes a huge molybdenum ring i don't remember exactly how big it is it might be like a hundred and fifty molybdenum atoms or something but if you think about the configuration space of that object you know it's exponentially large how many possible molecules so like why does the entire system collapse on just making that one structure mhmm if you start from like you know molybdenum atoms that are maybe just like a couple of them stuck together and so what they see in this system is there's a few intermediate stages so there's like some random events where the chemistry comes together makes these structures and then once you get to this very large one it becomes a template for the smaller ones and then the whole system just reinforces its own production how did lee find this molybdenum closed loop if i knew how lee's brain work i think i would understand a little more about the universe but i this is not an algorithmic discovery it's a like no but but you i think it goes to the deepest roots of like when he started thinking about origins of life so i like i i mean i don't know all his history but like what he's told me is he started out in crystallography and you know there are some things that he would just you know like people would just take for granted about chemical structures that he was like deeply perplexed about like just like why are these like really intricate really complex structures forming so easily under these conditions and he was really interested in life but he started in that field so he's just carried with him these sort of deep insights from these systems that seem like they're totally not alive and just like these metallic chemistries into actually thinking about the deep principles of life so i think he already he already knew a lot about that chemistry and he also you know assembly theory came from him thinking about how these systems work so he had some intuition about what was going on with this molybdenum ring the molybdenum might be able to be the thing that makes a ring they knew about them for a long time but they didn't know that the mechanism of why that particular structure form was autocatalytic feedback and so that's what they they figured out in this this paper and i actually think that paper is revealing some of the mechanism of the origin of life transition because really what you see like the origin of life is basically like you should have a combinatorial explosion of the space of possible structures that are too large to exhaust and yet you see it collapse on this you know really small space of possibilities that's mutually reinforcing itself to keep existing that is the origin of life there's some set of structures that result in this autocat catalytic feedback yeah and is it what is it tiny tiny tiny tiny percent i think it's a small space but chemistry is very large and so like there might be a lot of them out there but we don't know and one of them is the thing that probably started life on earth that's right or many many starts yes and it keeps starting maybe yeah i mean there's also all kinds of other weird properties that happen around this kind of phase boundary so this other project that i have in my lab is focused on the origin of chirality which is you know thinking about so so chirality is this property of molecules that they can come in mirror image forms so like just like chiral literally means hands so your your left and right hand are what's called nonsuperimposable because if you try to lay one on the other you can't actually lay them directly on top of each other and that's the property of being a mirror image so there's this sort of perplexing property the chemistry life that no one's been able to really adequately explain that all of the amino acids in proteins are left handed and all of the bases in rna and dna are right handed and yet the chemistry of these these building block units the amino acids and nucleobases is the same for left and right handed so you have to have like some kind of symmetry breaking where you go from these chemistries that seem entirely equivalent to only having one chemistry take over as the dominant form and for a long time i had been really i actually did my phd on the origin of chirality i was working on it as like a symmetry breaking problem in physics this is how i got started in the origin of life and then i left it for a long time because i thought it was like one of the most boring problems in original life but i've come back to it because i think there's something really deep going on here related to this like combinatorial explosion of the space of possibilities but just to to to get to that point like this feature of this handedness has been the main focus but people take for granted the existence of chiral molecules at all that the this property of of having a handedness and they just assume that you know like it's just a generic feature of chemistry but if you actually look at molecules if you look at chemical space which is like the space of all possible molecules that people can generate when you look at small molecules things that have less than about seven to eleven heavy atoms so things that are not hydrogen almost every single molecule in that space is achiral like doesn't have a chiral center so it would be like a spoon a spoon doesn't have a like it's the same as its mirror image it's not like a hand that's different than its mirror image but if you get to like this threshold boundary above that boundary almost every single molecule is chiral so you go from a universe where almost nothing has a mirror image form there's no mirror image universe of possibilities to this one where every single structure has pretty much a mirror image version and what we've been looking at in my lab is that it seems to be the case that the original life transition happens around the time when you start accumulating you you push your molecules to a large enough complexity that chiral molecules become very likely to form and then there's a cascade of molecular recognition where where chiral molecules can recognize each other and then you get this sort of autocatalytic feedback and things self reinforcing so is chirality in itself an interesting feature or just an accident of course no it's a super interesting feature i think chirality breaks symmetry in time not space so we think of it as a space spatial property like a left and right hand but if i choose the left hand i'm basically choosing the future of that system for all time because i basically made a choice between the ways that that molecule can now react with every other object in its chemical universe oh i see and so you've you're actually like when you have the splitting of making a molecule that now has another form it coulda had by the same exact atomic composition but now it's just a mirror image isometry you're basically splitting the universe of possibilities every time yeah in two in two but molecules can have more than one chiral center and that's not the only stereo symmetry that they can have so this is one of the reasons that taxol fills one point five universes of space it's all of these spatial permutations that you do on these objects that actually makes the space so huge the point of this sort of chiral transition that i'm i'm pointing out is is chirality is actually signature of being in a complex chemical space and the fact that we we think it's a really generic feature of chemistry and it's really prevalent is because most of the chemistry we study on earth is a product already of life and it also has to do with this transition in assembly this transition in possibility spaces because i i think there's something really fundamental going on at this boundary that you don't really need to go that far into chemical space if you can to actually see life in terms of this depth in time this depth in in symmetries of objects in terms of like chiral symmetries or this assembly structure but but getting past this boundary that's that's not very deep in that space requires life it's a it's a really it's a really weird property and it's really weird that so many abrupt things happen in chemistry at that same scale so would that be the the greatest invention ever made on earth in its evolutionary history so i really like that formulation of it nick lane has a book called life ascending where he lists the ten great inventions of evolution the origin of life being first and dna the hereditary material that encodes the genetic instructions for all living organisms then photosynthesis the process that allows organisms to convert sunlight into chemical energy producing oxygen as a byproduct the complex cell eukaryotic cells which contain nucleus and organelles that rose from simple bacterial cells sex sexual reproduction movement so just the ability to move under which you have the predation the predators and ability of living organisms that movement's in there that's cool yeah i but a movement includes a lot of interesting stuff in there like predator prey dynamic right which not to romanticize a nature's metal that seems like the important one i don't know it's such a computationally powerful thing to have a predator and prey well it's efficient for things to eat other things that are already alive because they don't have to go all the way back to the base chemistry well that but maybe i just like deadlines but it creates an urgency you're gonna get eaten you gotta live yeah like survival is not just the static environment you're battling against you're like yeah the the the dangers against which you're trying to survive are also evolving this is just much faster way to explore the space of possibilities i actually think it's a gift that we don't have much time yes sight the ability to see so the increasing complexifying of sensory organisms consciousness and death the concept of programmed cell death these are all inventions yeah along the line i like invention as a word for them i think that's good which are the more interesting inventions to you the origin of life because you kind of are not glorifying the origin of life itself there's a there's a process i think the origin of life is a continual process that's why i'm interested in the first transition in solving that problem because i think it's the hardest but i think i think i think it's happening all the time when you look back at the history of earth like what are you impressed happened i like sight as an invention because i think having sensory perception and trying to comprehend the world to use anthropocentric terms is like a really critical feature of life and i also it's interesting the way that sight has complexified over time right so like if you think of the original life nothing on the planet could see mhmm right so like for a long time life had no sight and then you know like photon receptors were invented and then when multicellular already evolved those cells eventually grew into eyes and we had the multicellular eye and and then it's interesting when you get to societies like human societies that we invent even better technologies of seeing like telescopes and microscopes which allow us to see deeper into the universe or at smaller scales so i think i think that's pretty profound the way that sight has transformed the ability of life to literally see the reality in which it's existing in i think consciousness is also obviously deeply interesting i've gotten kind of obsessed with like octopus i don't like i they're just so weird and the fact that like they evolved complex nervous systems kind of independently is like seems very alien yeah there's a lot of alien like organisms that's another thing i saw in the jungle yeah just things that are like oh okay they make one of those it just feels like there's examples there's a frog that's as as thin as a sheet of paper oh and i was like what and it gives birth through like pores like how i've seen videos of that so gross when the babies come out yes did you see that like yes like in person like the babies come out no i saw the ugh without the have you seen videos of that it's so gross yes it's one of the grossest things i've ever seen well so gross is just the other side of beautiful yes it's just like oh wow that that's that's possible i guess if i was one of those frogs i would think that was the most beautiful event i'd ever seen although like human childbirth is not that beautiful either yeah it's all a matter of perspective well we come into the world so violently it's just like it's amazing well i mean the world is a violent place yeah so again another it's just another side of the coin you know what this actually makes me think of one that's not up there which i do find really incredibly amazing is is the process of like the germline cell in you know in organisms like basically like every living thing on this planet at some point in its life has to go through a single cell and this whole issue of like development like the developmental program is kinda crazy like how do you build you out of a single cell how does a single cell know how to do that like you know pattern formation of a multicellular organism obviously like evolves with dna but there's a lot of stuff happening there about when cells take on certain morphologies and things that people don't understand like the actual shape formation mechanism and a lot of people study that and it's and there's a lot of advances being made now in that field i think it's pretty shocking though that like how little we know about that process and often it's left off of people's lists it's just kinda interesting embryogenesis is fascinating yeah because it you start from just one cell yeah and the genes in all the cells are the same right so like the differentiation has to be something that's like much more about like the actual like you know expression of genes over time and like how they get switched on and off and also the physical environment of like the cell interacting with other cells and there there's just a lot of stuff going on yeah the computation the intelligence of that process yes might be like the most important thing to understand and we just kinda don't really think about it right we think about the final product yeah maybe the the key to understanding the organism is understanding that process not the final product probably yes i think most of the things about understanding anything about what we are embedded in time of course you would say that i know it's so predictable it's turning into a deterministic universe it always has been always was like the meme yeah always was but it won't be in the future well that's before we talk about the future let's talk about the past the assembly theory yes can you explain assembly theory to me i listened to lee talk about it for many hours and i understood nothing no i'm just kidding i just wanted to take another well you've been already talking about it but just just just just just what from a big picture view is the assembly theory way of thinking about our world about our universe yeah i think the first thing is you know the like the observation that life seems to be the only thing in the universe that builds complexity in the way that we see it here and complexity is obviously like a loaded term so i'll just use assembly instead because i think assembly is more precise but the idea that like you know all the things on your desk here from your computer to the pen to you know us sitting here don't exist anywhere else in the universe as far as we know they only exist on this planet and it took a long evolutionary history to get to us is a real feature that we should take seriously as one that's deeply embedded in the laws of physics and the structure of the universe that we live in standard physics would say that you know all of that complexity traces back to the infinitesimal deviations and like the initial state of the universe that there was some order there i find that deeply unsatisfactory and what assembly theory says that's very different is that the universe is basically constructing itself and when you get to these combinatorial spaces like chemistry where the space of possibilities is too large to exhaust them all you can only construct things along historically contingent paths like you basically have causal chains of events that happen to allow other things to come into existence and and that this is the way that complex objects get formed is basically on scaffolding on the past history of objects making more complex objects making more complex objects that idea in itself is easy to state and simple but it has some really radical implications as far as what you think is the nature of the physics that would describe life and so what if assembly theory does formally is try to measure the boundary in the space of all things that you know chemically could exist for example like all possible molecules where is the boundary above which we should say these things are too complex to happen outside of an evolutionary chain of events outside of selection and we formalize that with two observables one of them is the copy number of the object so how many of the object did you observe and the second one is what's the minimal number of recursive steps to make it so if you start from elementary building blocks like bonds for molecules and you put them together and then you take things you've made already and build up to the object what's the shortest number of steps you had to take and what lee's been able to show in the lab with his team is that for organic chemistry it's about fifteen steps and then you only see molecules that you know the only molecules that we observe that are past that threshold are ones that are are in life and in fact one of the things i'm trying to do with this idea of like trying to actually quantify the original life as a transition in like a phase transition assembly theory is actually be able to explain why that boundary is where it is because i think that's actually the boundary that life must cross so the idea of going back to this thing we're talking about before about these these structures that can reinforce their own existence and move past that boundary fifteen seems to be that boundary in chemical space it's not a universal number it will be different for different assembly spaces but that's what we've experimentally validated so far and then so literally fifteen like the assembly index is fifteen it's fifteen or so for the experimental data yeah so that's when you start getting the self reinforcing that's when you have to have that feature in order for to observe molecules in high abundance in that space so copy number is the the number of exact copies that's what we mean by high abundance and assembly index or the complexity of the object is how many steps it took to create it recursive recursive yeah so you can think of objects in assembly theory as basically re recursive stacks of the the construction steps to build them so they're like it's like i you take this step and then you make this object and you make it this object and make this object and then you get up to the final object but that object is all of that history rolled up into the current structure what if you took the long way home you can't take the long way why not the long way doesn't exist it's a good song though what do you mean the long way doesn't exist if i do if i do a random walk from a to b i'll eventually if i started a i'll eventually end up at b and that random walk would be much shorter than turns out longer than the short one if you look at objects and you so the we we define something we call the assembly universe an assembly universe is ordered in time it's actually ordered in in the causation the number of steps to produce an object and so all objects in the universe are in some sense exist at a layer that's defined by their assembly index and the size of each layer is growing exponentially so what you're talking about if you wanna look at the long way of getting to an object as i'm increasing the assembly index of an object i'm moving deeper and deeper into an exponentially growing space and it's actually also the case that the sort of typical path to get to that object is also exponentially growing with respect to the assembly index and so if you want to try to make a more and more complex object and you wanna do it by a a typical path that's actually an exponentially receding horizon and so most objects that come into existence have to be causally very similar to the things that exist because they're close by in that space and they can actually get to it by an almost shortest path for that object the the almost shortest path is the most likely and but and like by a lot by a lot okay so if you see see a high copy number yeah imagine yourself greater than one yeah i mean basically we live the more complex we get we live in a a a space that is growing exponentially large and the the ways of getting to objects in the space are also growing exponentially large and so we're this kind of recursively like stacked structure of like all of these objects that are clinging onto each other for existence and then they like grab something else and are allow like able to bring that thing into existence because it's kinda similar to them but there is a phase transition there is a there is a transition there is a place where you would say oh that's fine actually abrupt i've never been able to say that in in my entire career before i've always gone back and forth about whether the original life was kinda gradual or abrupt i think it's very abrupt poetics we can play literally with snaps okay that's very beautiful snaps okay but i'll be poetic today but no i think there's like a lot of random exploration and then there's a like and then the structure the possibility space just collapses on the structure kinda really fast that can reinforce its own existence because it's basically fighting against nonexistence yeah you tweeted the most significant struggle for existence in the evolutionary process is not among the objects that do exist but between the ones that do and those that never have the chance to yeah this is where selection does most of its causal work the the objects that never get a chance to exist yeah the struggle between the ones that never get a chance to exist and the ones that okay what what's that line exactly i don't know we can make songs out of all of these what about objects that never get a chance to exist what does that mean so there was there was this website i forgot what it was but it's like it's like a a neural network that just generates a human face and it's like this person does not exist i think that's what it's called right so you can just click on that all day and you can look at people all day that don't exist yeah all of those people exist in that space of things that don't exist yeah but there's a real struggle yeah so the struggle of the quote the struggle of it for existence is you know that goes all the way back to darwin's writing about natural selection right so like the whole idea of survival of the fittest is everything struggling to exist this predator or prey dynamic and and the fittest survive and so the struggle for existence is really what selection is all about but you're and that's true we do see things that do exist competing to continue to exist but each time that like if you think about this space of possibilities and you know each time the universe you know generates a new structure or like an an object that exists generates a new structure along this causal chain it's generating something that exists that never existed before and each time that we make that kind of decision we're excluding a huge space possibilities and so actually like as this process of increasing assembly index it's not just that like the space that these objects exist in is becoming exponentially less and less likely to ever exist and so existence excludes a huge number of things just because of the accident of history how it ended up yeah it's it it is in part an accident because i think i think some of the the structure that gets generated is is driven a bit by randomness i think a lot of it you know so you know one of the conceptions that we have in assembly theory is you know the universe is random at its base you can see this in chemistry like unconstrained chemical reactions are pretty random and then and also quantum mechanics you know like there's lots of places that that give evidence for that and deterministic structures emerge by things that can causally reinforce themselves and maintain persistence over time and so we are some of the most deterministic things in the universe and so like we can generate very regular structure and we can generate new structure along a particular lineage but the possibility space at this sort of tips like the things we can generate next is really huge so there's some stochasticity in what we actually you know instantiate as like the next structures that get built in in the biosphere it's not completely deterministic because the space of future possibilities is always larger than the space of things that exist now so how many instantiations of life is out there do you think so how how often does this happen what we see happen here on earth how often is this process repeated throughout our galaxy throughout the universe so i i said before like right now i think the origin of life is a continuous process on earth like i think this this idea of like combinatorial spaces that our biosphere generates not just chemistry but other spaces often cross this threshold where they then allow themselves to persist with particular regular structure over time so language is is another one where you know like the space of you know possible configurations of the twenty six letters of the english alphabet is astronomically large but we use with very high regularity certain structures and then we associate meaning to them because of the regularity of like how much we use them right so meaning is an emergent property of the causation in the objects and like how often they recur and and what the relationship of the recurrence is to other objects meaning is the emergent property okay got it well this is why you can play with language so much actually so words don't really carry meaning it's just about how you lace them together yeah but from from where does the but you you don't have a lot of room obviously as as a speaker of a given language you don't have a lot of room with a given word to wiggle but you do have you do have you have a certain amount of room to push the meanings of words yeah and and i do this all the time and you have to do it with the kind of work that i do because if you want to discover an abstraction like some kind of concept that we don't understand yet we it means we don't have the language and so the words that we have are inadequate to describe the things this is why we're having a hard time talking about assembly theory because it's a newly emerging idea and so so i'm constantly playing with words in different ways to to try to convey the meaning that is actually behind the words but it's hard to do so you have to wiggle within the constraints yes lots of wiggle the the great orators are are just good at wiggling do you wiggle i'm not a very good wiggler no this is the problem this is part of the problem no i like playing with words a lot you know it's very funny because you know like i i i know you talked about this with lee but like people are so offended by the writing of the paper that came out last fall and it was it was interesting because the ways that we use were words were not the way that people were interacting with the words and i think that was part of the mismatch where we were trying to use words in a new way because we were trying to describe something that you know hadn't been described adequately real time for me being someone that tries to be so precise with my word usage knowing that it's always gonna be vague boy can i relate it's like what is truth is truth the thing you meant when you wrote the words or is truth the thing that people understood when they read the words oh yeah i i think that compression mechanism into language is a really interesting one and that's why twitter is a nice exercise because i love twitter yeah you get to write a thing and you think a certain thing when you write it and then you get to see all these other people interpret it all kinds of different ways i use it as an experimental platform for that reason i wish there was a higher diversity of interpretation mechanisms applied to tweets meaning like oh all kinds of different people would come to it like some people that see the good in everything and some people that are ultra cynical a a bunch of haters and a bunch of lovers and a bunch of maybe they could do better jobs with presenting material to people like you know the the rant like like how things you know it's like usually based on interest but i think it would be really nice if you got like ten percent of your twitter feed was random stuff sampled from other places that'd be kinda fun true also would love to filter just like bin the response to tweets by like the people that hate on everything yes the people that are oh that would be fantastic the people that are like super positive about everything and then that they'll just kinda i guess normalize their response yeah because then it'd be cool to see if the people that are usually positive about everything are hating on you or like totally don't understand or completely misunderstood yeah usually it takes a lot of clicking to find that out yeah yeah so it'd be better if it was sorted yeah the more clicking you do the more damaging it is to the soul yeah it's like instead of like well you could have the blue check but you should have like are you a pessimist an optimist yeah there's a lot of colors neutral what's your what's your what's your rainbow of checks and then you realize there's more categories than we can possibly express in colors yeah of course people are complex that's our best feature i don't know how we got to the wiggling required given the constraints of language because i think we started about me asking about alien life which which is how many different times did the phase transition happen elsewhere do you think there's other alien civilizations out there this goes into like the you know like are you on the boundary of insane or not but you know when you think about the the structure of the physics of what we are that deeply it really changes your conception of things and you know going to this idea of the universe you know being kinda small in physical space compared to how big it is in time and like how large we are it really makes me question about whether there's any other structure that's like this giant crystal in time this giant causal structure like our biosphere slash technosphere is anywhere else in the universe why not i don't why i don't know just because this one is gigantic doesn't mean there's other jig there's other gigantic but but i think when the universe is expanding right it's expanding in space but in assembly theory it's also expanding in time and actually that's driving the expansion in space and expansion in time is also driving the expansion in the sort of combinatorial space of things on our planet so that's driving the sort of you know pace of technology and all the other things so time is driving all of these things which is a little bit crazy to think that the universe is just getting bigger because time is getting bigger but like the sort of visual that gets built in my brain about that is like the structure that we're building on this planet is packing more and more time in this very small volume of space right because our planet hasn't changed its physical size in four billion years but there's like a ton of causation and recursion and time whatever word you wanna use information packed into this and i think this is also you know embedded in sort of the virtualization of our technologies or the abstraction of language and all of these things these these these things that seem really abstract are just really deep in time and so so what that looks like is you have a a planet that becomes increasingly virtualized and so it's getting bigger and bigger in time but not really expanding out in space and the rest of space is like kind of moving away from it so again it's a sort of exponentially receding horizon and i'm just not sure how far into this evolutionary process something gets if it can ever see that there's another such structure out there what do you mean by virtualized in that context virtual as sort of a play on virtual reality and like simulation theories but virtual also in a sense of you know we talk about virtual particles in in particle physics which you know they they are very critical to doing calculations about predicting the properties of real particles but we don't observe them directly so what i mean by virtual here is virtual reality for me things that appear virtual appear abstract are just things that are very deep in time in the in the structure of the things that we are so if you think about you as a four billion year old object the things that are part of you like your capacity to use language or think abstractly or have mathematics are just very you know like deep temporal structures that's why they look like they're informational and abstract is because they're like they're existing in this temporal part of you but not necessarily spatial part just because i have a four billion year old history why does that mean i can't hang out with aliens there's a couple ideas that are embedded here so one of them comes again from paul he wrote this book years ago about you know like the eerie silence and why we're alone and he concluded the book with this idea of quintelligence or something but like this idea that like really advanced intelligence would basically just build itself into a quantum computer and it would wanna operate in the vacuum of space because that's the best place to do quantum computation and it would just like run out all of its computations indefinitely but it would look completely dark to the rest of the universe and i don't think as as typical like i don't think that's actually like the right physics but i think something about that idea as i do with all ideas is partially correct and freeman dyson also had this amazing paper about how long life could persist in a universe that was exponentially expanding and his conception was like if you imagine analog life form it could run slower and slower and slower and slower and slower as a function of time and so it would it would be able to run indefinitely even against an exponentially expanding universe because it would just run exponentially slower and so i guess part of what i'm doing in my brain is putting those two things together along with this idea that we are building you know like if you if you imagine with our technology we're now building virtual realities right like things we actually call virtual reality which required you know four billions of years of history and a whole bunch of data to basically embed them in a computer architecture so now you can put like you know an oculus headset on and think that you're in this world right and what you really are embedded in is in a very deep temporal structure and so it's huge in time but it's very small in space and you can go lots of places in the virtual space right but you're still stuck in like your physical body and like sitting in the chair and so you know part of it is it might be the case that sufficiently evolved biospheres kind of virtualize themselves and they internalize their universe in their sort of temporal causal structure and they close themselves off from the rest of the universe i just don't know if a deep temporal structure necessarily means that you're closed off no i don't either so that's kinda my fear so i'm not i'm not sure i'm agreeing with what i say i'm just saying like this is one sort of conclusion and you know like in my most sort of like it's interesting because i i don't do psychedelic drugs but when people describe to me like your thing with the faces and stuff and like i have you know had a lot of deep conversations with friends that have done psychedelic drugs for intellectual reasons and otherwise but i'm always like oh it sounds like you're just doing theoretical physics like that's what brains do on theoretical physics so i i live in these like really abstract spaces most of the time but there's also this this issue of extinction right like extinction events are basically pinching off an entire like causal structure the one of these like i'm gonna call them time crystals i don't like know what but there's like these very large objects in time pinching off that whole structure from the rest of it and so it's like if you imagine that sort of same thing in the universe i you know i once thought that sufficiently advanced technologies would look like black holes they'll be just completely imperceptible to us yeah so so there might be lots of aliens out there maybe that's the explanation for all the singularities they're all pinched off causal structures that virtualize their reality and kinda broke off from us black holes in every way so like untouchable to us or unlikely to be yeah detectable by us right with whatever sensory mechanisms we have yeah but the other way i think about it is is there is probably hopefully life out there so i do work on life detection efforts in the solar system and i'm trying to help with the habitable worlds observatory mission planning right now and working with like the biosignatures team for that like to think about exoplanet biosignatures so like i have some optimism that we might find things but there are the challenges that we don't know the likelihood for life like which is what you were talking about so if i get to a more grounded discussion what i'm really interested in doing is trying to solve the origin of life so we can understand how likely life is out there so i don't think that the i think that the problem of discovering alien life and solving the origin of life are deeply coupled and are in fact are one in the same problem and that the first contact with alien life will actually be in an origin of life experiment but but that part i'm super interested in and then there's this other feature that i think about a lot which is our own technological phase of development as sort of like what is this phase in the evolution of life on a planet if you think about a a biosphere emerging on a planet and evolving over billions of years and evolving into a technosphere when a technosphere can move off planet and basically reproduce itself on another planet now you have biospheres reproducing themselves basically they have to go through technology to do that and so there are ways of thinking about sort of the nature of intelligent life and how it spreads in that capacity that i'm also really excited about and thinking about and all of those things for me are connected like we have to solve the origin of life in order for us to get off planet because we basically have to start life on another planet and we also have to solve the origin of life in order to recognize other alien intelligence like all of these things are like literally the same problem right understanding the origin of life here on earth is a way to understand ourselves into understanding ourselves as a prerequisite for being able to detect other intelligent civilizations i for one take it for what it's worth on ayahuasca one of the things i did is zoom out like aggressively like like a spaceship and it it would always go quickly to the galaxy and from the galaxy to this representation of the universe and at least for me from that perspective it seemed like it was full of alien life not just alien life but intelligent life i like that and conscious life so like i don't know how to convert it into words it's more like a feeling like you were saying yeah a feeling converted to a visual to convert to words so i had a visual with it but really it was a feeling that it was just full of this vibrant energy that i was feeling when i'm looking at the people in my life yeah and full of gratitude but that same exact thing is everywhere in the universe right so i totally agree with this like that visual i really love and i think we live in a universe that like generates life and purpose and like it's it's part of the structure of just the world and so maybe like this sort of lonely view i have is i never thought about it this way till you're describing that i was like i wanna live in that universe and i'm like a very optimistic person and i love i love building visions of reality that are positive but i think for me right now in the intellectual process i have to tunnel through this this particular way of thinking about the loneliness of being like separated in time from everything else which i think like we also all are because time is what defines us as individuals so part of you is drawn to the trauma of being alone deep in a in a physics you know yeah that's part part of what i mean is like you have to go through ideas you don't necessarily agree with to work out what you're trying to understand and i'm trying to be inside the structure so i can really understand it and i don't think i've been able to like like i'm so deeply embedded in what we are intellectually right now that i i don't have an ability to see these others these other ones that you're describing if they're there well one of the things you kinda described that you already spoke to you call it the great perceptual filter yeah so there's the the famous great filter which is basically the idea that there's some really powerful moment in every intelligent civilization that where they destroy themselves yeah that explains why we have not seen aliens and you're saying that there's something like that in the temporal history of the creation of complex objects that at a certain point they've become an island an island too far to reach based on the perceptions i hope not yeah but yeah i worry about it yeah but that's basically meaning there's something fundamental about the universe where if the more complex you become the the harder it will be to perceive other complex yeah i i mean just think about us with microbial life right like we used to once be cells and for most of human history we didn't even recognize cellular life was there until we built a new technology microscopes that allowed us to see them right so that's kinda kinda weird right like like things that they're close to us they're close they're everywhere but also in the history of the development of complex objects they're pretty close yeah super close super close like yeah i mean everything on this planet is like it's like pretty much the same thing like like the space of possibilities is so huge it's like we're virtually identical so how many flavors or kinds of life do you think are possible i'm kinda like trying to imagine all the little flickering lights in the universe like in the way that you were describing that was kinda cool it was so i mean it was awesome to me it was exactly that it was like lights yeah the way the way you maybe see a city but a city from like up above you see a city with the flickering lights but there's a coldness to the city yeah there's some you know that you know humans are capable of good and evil and you could see like there's a complex feeling to the city i had no such complex feeling about seeing the lights of all the galaxies whatever the billions of galaxies yeah this is kinda cool i'll answer the question in a second but i just maybe like this idea of flickering lights and intelligence is interesting to me because i you know like we have such a human centric view of alien intelligences that a lot of the work that i've been doing with my lab is just trying to take inspiration from nonhuman life on earth and so i have this really talented undergrad student that's basically building a model of alien communication based on fireflies so one of my colleagues orit peleg is she's totally brilliant but she she goes out with like gopro cameras and like you know films in high resolution all these firefly flickering and she has like this theory about how their signaling evolved to like maximally differentiate the flickering patterns so like she has a theory basically that predicts you know like this species should flash like this if this one's flashing like this this other one's gonna do it at a slower rate so that they you know like they can distinguish each other living in the same environment and so this undergrad's building this model where you have like a pulsar background of all these like giant flashing sources in the universe and an alien intelligence you know wants to signal it's there so it's flashing like a firefly and i just like i like the idea of thinking about nonhuman aliens so that was really fun the mechanism of the flashing unfortunately is like the diversity of that is very high and we might not be able to see it that's what yeah well i think there's some ways we might be able to differentiate that signal i'm still thinking about this part of it so one is like like if you have pulsars and they all have a certain spectrum to their pulsing patterns and you have this one signal that's in there that's basically tried to maximally differentiate itself from all the other sources in the universe it might stick out in the distribution like there might be ways of actually being able to tell if it's it's an anomalous pulsar basically but i don't know if that would really work or not so still thinking about it you tweeted if one wants to understand how truly combinatorially and compositionally complex our universe is they only need step into the world of fashion yeah it's bonkers how big the construct constructible space of human aesthetics is can you explain can can we explore the space of human aesthetics yeah i don't know i've been kind of obsessed with the i never know how to pronounce it schiaparelli like you know like like they they have ears and things like it's such like a like a weird grotesque aesthetic but like it's it's totally bizarre but what i meant like i like i have a visceral experience when i walk into my closet i have like a lot of how big is your closet it's pretty big it's like i do assembly theory every morning when i walk in my closet because i have i like i really like a very large combinatorial diverse palette but i never know what i'm gonna build in the morning do you get rid of stuff sometimes or do you have trouble getting rid of stuff like i have trouble getting rid of some stuff it depends on what it is if it's very if it's vintage it's hard to get rid of because it's kinda hard to replace it depends on the piece yeah so you have your closet is the is the one of those temporal time crystals that yeah that just it's like get to visualize the entire history of the physical manifestation of my personality right so so why is that a good visualization of the the the combinatorial and composition and complex i think it's an interesting feature of our species that we allow we get to express ourselves through what we wear right like if you think about all those animals in the jungle you saw like they're born looking the way they look and then they're stuck with it for life that's true i mean it is one of the loudest clearest most consistent ways we signal to each other yeah the clothing we wear yeah and it's highly dynamic i mean you can be dynamic if you want to very few people are are it's it's there's a certain bravery but it's actually more about confidence willing to play with style and like and play with aesthetics and i think it's interesting when you start experimenting with it how it changes the fluidity of the social spaces and the way that you interact with them but there's also commitment like you have to wear that outfit all day i know i know that's so big commitment do you feel like that every morning i wear it that's why i feel like this is a life commitment so all i have is suits and a black shirt and jeans those are the two outfits yeah well see this is the thing though right it simplifies your thought process in the morning so like i have other ways i do that i park in the same exact parking spot when i go to work on the fourth floor of a parking garage because no one ever parks on the fourth floor so i can i don't have to remember where i park my car mhmm but i really like aesthetics and playing with them so i'm willing to spend part of my cognitive energy every morning trying to figure out what i wanna be that day did you deliberately think about the the outfit you're wearing today yep was there backup options were you going back and forth between three or four but i really like that drastically different yes okay it's okay and then even this one could have been really different because like you know it's not just the the sort of jacket and the shoes and like and the hairstyle it's like the jewelry and the accessories so like any outfit is is a lot of small decisions well i think your current outfit is like a lot of shades of yellow there's like a theme yeah it's nice it's it's really i'm grateful that you did that it's like it's it's it's own art form yeah yellow is my daughter's favorite color and i never really thought about yellow much but she's been obsessed with yellow she's seven now and i don't know i just really love it i guess you can pick a color and just make that the constraint and we just go with it i understand yellow a lot lately like this is not even the most yellow because i have black pants on but i have i i i've worn outfits that have probably five shades of yellow in them wow what what do you think beauty is we seem to so underlying this idea of playing with aesthetics is we find certain things beautiful yeah what is it that humans find beautiful and why do we need to find things beautiful yeah you know it's interesting it's not i'm not i i mean i am attracted to to to style and aesthetics because i think they're beautiful but it's much more because i think it's fun to play with and so so i will get to the beauty thing but i like i i guess i wanna just explain a little bit about my motivation in this space because it's really an intellectual thing for me and you know stewart brand has this great infographic about the layers of like human society and i think it starts with like the natural sciences and like physics at the bottom and it goes through all these layers and it's like economics and then like fashion is at the top it's like the fastest moving part of human culture and i think i really like that because it's so dynamic and so short and it's temporal longevity contrasted with like studying the laws of physics which are like you know like the deep structure reality that i feel like i like bridging those scales tells me much more about the structure of the world that i live in that said there's some kinds of fashions like a dude in a black suit with a black tie it seems to be less dynamic yeah it seems to persist through time are you embodying this yeah i think so i i i think i think it just i'd like to see you wear yellow wax i don't i wouldn't even know what to do with myself i would freak out i wouldn't know how to act together be you yeah how to do that amazing though isn't it amazing like you have the choice to do it but but one of my favorite just on the question of beauty one of my favorite fashion designers of all time is alexander mcqueen and he he was really phenomenal but like his early and actually i kind of i kind of used like what happened to him in the fashion industry coping mechanism with our paper when like the nature paper in in the the fall when everyone was saying it was controversial and how terrible that like you know like but controversial is good right but like when alexander mcqueen you know first came out with his fashion lines he was mixing horror and beauty and people were horrified it was so controversial like they like it was macabre he had like you know like it looked like there were blood on the models and like that's beautiful we're just looking at some pictures here yeah no i mean his stuff is amazing his first like runway line i think was called nihilism i don't know i don't know if you could find it you know i mean he was really dramatic he he carried a lot of trauma with him there you go that's yeah yeah wow but he changed the fashion industry his stuff became very popular that's that's a good outfit to show up to a party right right but this gets at the question like is is that horrific or is it beautiful and i think you know he he had a traumatic he ended up committing suicide and actually he left his death note on the descent of man so he was he was a really deep person so i mean great fashion certainly has that kind of depth to it yeah it sure does so i think it's the intellectual pursuit right like it's not so this is like very highly intellectual and i think it's a lot like how i play with language it's the same way that i play with fashion or the same way that i play with ideas in theoretical physics like there's always this space that you can just push things just enough so they're like they look like something someone thinks is familiar but they're not familiar and yeah and i think that's really cool it seems like beauty doesn't have much function right but but it seems to also have a lot of influence on the way we it has tons of function what do you mean it doesn't have function i guess sexual selection incorporates beauty somehow but why because beauty is a sign of health or something i don't even oh evolutionarily maybe but then beauty becomes a signal of other things right so it's really not like and then beauty becomes an adaptive trait so it can change with different like you know maybe some peop some species would think well you thought the frog having babies come out of its back was beautiful and i thought it was grotesque like there's not a universal definition of what's beautiful it is something that is dependent on your history and how you interact with the world and i guess what i like about beauty like any other concept is when you turn it on its head so you know maybe the traditional conception of you know why women wear makeup and they dress certain ways is because they wanna look beautiful and you know pleasing to people and i just like to do it because it's a confidence thing it's about embodying the person that i want to be and about owning that person and then that the way that people interact with that person is very different than if i didn't have the like if i wasn't using that as part of and obviously that that's influenced by the society i live and like what's aesthetically pleasing things but it's interesting to be able to turn that around and not have it necessarily be about the aesthetics but about the power dynamics that the aesthetics create but you're saying there's some function to beauty in that way in the way you're describing and the dynamic it creates in the social interaction well well the point is you're saying it's an adaptive trait for like sexual selection or something and i'm saying that the adaptation that beauty confers is far richer than that and some of the adaptation is about social hierarchy and social mobility and just plain social dynamics like why do some people dress golf it's because they identify with a community and a culture associated with that and they get you know and and that's a a beautiful aesthetic it's a it's a different aesthetic some people don't like it so it has the same richness as does language yes it's the same kind of yes and i think i think too few people think about the way that they the aesthetics they build for themselves in the morning and how they carry it in the world and and the way that other people interact with that because they put clothes on and they don't think about clothes as carrying function let's jump from beauty to language there's so many ways to explore the topic of language you called it you said that language is parts of language or language in itself or the mechanism of language is is is a kind of living life form mhmm you've tweeted a lot about this in all kinds of poetic ways let's talk about the computation aspect of it you you you tweeted the world is not a computation but computation is our best current language for understanding the world it is important we recognize this so we can start to see the structure of our future languages that will allow us to see deeper than the computation allows us so what's the use of language in helping us understand and make sense of the world i think one thing that i feel like i i notice much much more viscerally than i feel like i hear other people describe is that the representations in our mind and the way that we use language are not the things like actually i mean this is an important point going back to to what godel did but also this idea of signs and symbols and and all kinds of ways of separating them there's like the word right and then there's like what the word means about the world and we often confuse those things and what i i feel very viscerally i almost sometimes think i have some kind of like synesthesia for language or something and i just like don't interact with it like the way that other people do but for me words are objects and the objects are not the things that they describe they have like a different ontology to them like they're physical things and they carry causation and they can create meaning but they're not they're not they're they're not what we think they are and and also like the internal representations in our mind like the things i'm seeing about this room are probably you know like they're small projection of the things that are actually in this room and i think we have such a difficult time moving past the way that we build representations in the mind and the way that we structure our language to realize that those are approximations to what's out there and they're fluid and we can play around with them and we can see deeper structure underneath them that i think like we're missing a lot yeah but also the life of the mind is in some ways richer than the physical reality so what's going on in your mind might be a projection right actually here but there's all also all all kinds of other stuff going on there yeah for sure i love this essay by poincare about like mathematical creativity where he talks about this sort of like frothing of all these things and then like somehow you build theorems on top of it and they become kinda concrete but like and i also think about this with language it's like there's a lot of stuff happening in your mind but you have to compress it in this few sets of words to try to convey it to someone so it's it's a compactification of the space and it's not a very efficient one and i think just recognizing that there's a lot that's happening behind language is really important i think this is this is one of the the great things about the existential trauma of large language models i think is the recognition that language is not the only thing required like there's something underneath it not by everybody can you just speak to the feeling you have when you think about words so is there like what's the magic of words to you is it like do you feel it it almost sometimes feels like you're playing with it like yeah i was just gonna say it's like a playground but but you're almost like i think one of the things you enjoy maybe i'm projecting is deviating like using words in ways that not everyone uses them like slightly sort of deviating from the norm a little bit just doing that in everything i do but especially with language but not so far that it doesn't make sense exactly so you're always like tethered to reality to the norm but like are playing with it like basically fucking with people's minds a little bit i mean like you know and in so doing creating a different perspective on the thing that's been previously explored in a different way yeah it's literally my favorite thing to do yeah like use words as one way to make people think yeah so i you know a lot of my sort of like what happens in my mind when i'm thinking about ideas is i've been presented with this information about how people think about things and i try to go around to different things like they all think about it different ways and then i just try to figure out like things like they all think about it different ways and then i just try to figure out like how do you take the structure of the way that we're talking about it and turn it slightly so you have all the same pieces that everybody sees are there but the description that you've come up with seems totally different so they can understand that there's like they understand the pattern you're describing but they never heard the structure underlying it describe the way that you describe it is there words or terms you remember that disturbed people the most maybe the positive sense of disturbed this assembly theory i suppose is one yeah i mean the the first couple sentences of that paper disturbed people a lot and i think they were really carefully constructed in exactly this kind of way what was that let me look it up oh it was really fun but i think it's interesting because i do you know some time i'm very upfront about it i say i'm gonna use the same word in probably six different ways in a lecture and i will you're right scientists have grappled with reconciling biological evolution with the immutable laws of the universe defined by physics yeah these laws underpin life's origin evolution and and this with me when he was here too the development let's take a part of the of human culture well he was i think your love for words runs deeper than these yeah for sure i mean this is part of the the sort of brilliant thing about our collaboration is you know complimentary skill set so i love playing with the abstract space of language and it's a really interesting playground when i'm working with lee because he thinks that a much deeper level of abstraction than can be expressed by language and the ideas we work on are hard to talk about for that reason what do you think about computation as a language i think it's a very poor language a lot of people think it's a really great one but i i think it has some nice properties but i i think the the feature of it that you know is is compelling is this kind of idea of universality that like you can if you if you if you have a language you can describe things in any other language well for me one of the people who kind of revealed the expressive power of computation aside from alan turing is stephen wolfram through all the explorations of like cellular automata type of objects that he did in in a new kind of science and afterwards so what what do you get from that like the the kind of computational worlds that are revealed through even something as simple as cellular automata it seems like that's a really nice way to explore languages that are far outside our human languages and do so rigorously and understand how those kinds of complex systems can interact with each other can emerge all that kind of stuff i don't think that they're outside our human languages i think they define the boundary of the space of human languages they allow us to explore things within that space which is also fantastic but i think there is a set of ideas that takes and and stephen wolfram has worked on this quite a lot and contributed very significantly to it and you know i really like some of the stuff that steven's doing with like his physics project but don't agree with a lot of the foundations of it but i i think the space is really fun that he's exploring you know there's this assumption that computation is at the base of reality and i kind of see it at the top of reality not at the base because i think computation was built by our biosphere it's it's something that happened after many billion years of evolution and it doesn't happen in every physical object it only happens in some of them and i think one of the reasons that we feel like the universe is computational is because it's so easy for us as things that have the theory of computation in our minds and actually in some sense it it might be related to the functioning of our minds and how we build languages to describe the world and sets of relations to describe the world but it's easy for us to go out into the world and build computers and then we mistake our ability to do that with assuming that the world is computational and i'll give you a really simple example this one came from john conway conway i one time had a conversation with him which was really delightful he was really fun but he was pointing out that if you you know string lights in a barn you know you can you can program them to have your favorite one dimensional ca and you might even be able to make them you know do a u like be capable of universal computation is universal computation a feature of the string lights well no no it's probably not it's a feature of the fact that you as a programmer had a theory that you could embed in the physical architecture of the string lights now what happens though is we get confused by this kind of distinction between us as agents in the world that actually can transfer transfer things that life does onto other physical substrates with what the world is and so for example you'll see people you know doing studying the mathematics of chemical reaction networks and saying well chemistry is turning universal or studying the laws of physics and saying the laws of physics are turing universal but anytime that you wanna do that you always have to prepare an initial state you have to you know you have to constrain the rule space and then you have to actually be able to demonstrate the properties of computation and all of that requires an agent or a designer to be able to do that but it gives you an intuition if you look at a one d or two d cellular automata it gives you it allows you to build an intuition of how you can have complexity emerge from very simple beginnings very simple initial condition i think that's the intuition that people have derived from it the intuition i get from cellular automata is that the flat space of an initial condition in a fixed dynamical law is not rich enough to describe an open ended generation process and so the way i see cellular automata is they're embedded slices in a much larger causal structure and if you wanna look at a deterministic slice of that causal structure you might be able to extract a set of consistent rules that you might call a cellular automata but you can embed them as much larger space that's not dynamical and is about the causal structure and relations between all of those computations and that would be the space cellular automata live in and i think that's the space that steven is talking about when he talks about his rulli ad and these hypergraphs of all these possible computations but i wouldn't take that as my base reality because i think again computation itself this abstract property computation is not at the base of reality so can we just linger on that rulli ad this yeah a one one rulli ad to rule them all yeah so what this is part of wolfram yeah physics project it's what he calls the entangled limit of everything that is is computationally possible so what what's your problem with the oliad well it's interesting so so steven came to a workshop we had in the beyond center in the fall and the workshop theme was mathematics is it evolved or eternal and he gave a talk about the rouleid and he was talking about how you know a lot of the things that we talk about in the beyond center like does reality have a bottom you know if it has a bottom what is it you know like i need to i need to i need to go well i'm happy to one sometime this is great but does reality have a bottom yeah so we had one that was it was called infinite turtles or ground truth and it was really just about this this this issue but the but the thing that was interesting i think i think steven was trying to make the argument that you know fundamental particles aren't fundamental gravitation is not fundamental you know these are just turtles and computation is fundamental and i just i i remember pointing out to him i was like well computation is your turtle and i think it's a weird turtle to have first of all isn't it okay to have a turtle it's totally fine to have a turtle everyone has a turtle mhmm you can't build a theory without a turtle yep it's just so it depends on the problem you wanna describe and i actually the the reason i can't get behind steven's ontology is i don't know what question he's trying to answer and without a question to answer i don't understand why you're building a theory of reality and the question you're trying to answer is what life is what life is which another which will simpler way of phrasing this how did life originate well i started working in the original life and i think what my challenge was there was no one knew what life was and so you can't really talk about the origination of something if you don't know what it is and so the way i would approach it is if you wanna understand what life is then proving that physics is solving the original life so there's the theory of what life is but there's the actual demonstration that that theory is an accurate description of the phenomena you aim to describe so again they're the same problem it's not like i can decouple original life from what life is it's it's like that is the problem and i the the point i guess i'm making about having a question is no matter what slice of reality you take what regularity of nature you're gonna try to describe there will be there there will be an abstraction that unifies that structure of reality hopefully and and that will have a fundamental layer to it right because you have to explain something in terms of something else but so if i wanna explain life for example then my fundamental description of nature has to be something i think that has to do with time being fundamental but if i wanted to describe i don't know the sort of interactions of matter and light you know i have elementary particles be fundamental if i wanna describe electricity and magnetism in the eighteen hundreds i have to have waves be fundamental right so like you you are in quantum mechanics like it's a wave function that's fundamental because that's the the sort of explanatory paradigm of your theory so i guess i don't know what problem saying computation is fundamental solves doesn't he want to understand how does the basic quantum mechanics and general relativity emerge yeah but cut his time right so i think then that doesn't really answer an important question for us well i think that the issue is general relativity and quantum mechanics are expressed in mathematical languages mhmm and then computation is a mathematical language so you're basically saying that maybe there's a more universal mathematical language for describing theories of physics that we already know that's an important question and i do think that's what steven's trying to do and do well but it's then the question becomes does that formulation of a more universal language for describing the laws of physics that we know now tell us anything new about the nature of reality or is it a language ntu languages are fundamental can't be fundamental the language itself is never the fundamental thing it's whatever it's describing so one of the possible titles you were thinking about originally for the book is the hard problem of life sort of reminiscent of the hard problem of consciousness so you're saying that assembly theory is supposed to be answering the question about what is life so let's go to the other hard problems you also say that's the easiest of the hard problems is the is the hard problem of life mhmm so what do you think is the nature of intelligence and consciousness do you think something like assembly theory can help us understand that i think if assembly theory is an accurate depiction of the physics of life it should shed a lot of light on those problems and in fact i sometimes wonder if the problems of consciousness and intelligence are at all different than the problem of life generally and i'm not i'm i i'm of two minds of it but i i in general try to you know like the process of my thinking is trying to regularize everything into one theory so pretty much every interaction i have is like oh how do i fold that into and like so i'm just building this giant abstraction that's basically trying to take every piece of data i've ever gotten in my in my brain into a theory of what life is and consciousness and intelligence are obviously some of the most interesting things that life has manifest and so i think they're very telling about some of the deeper features about the nature of life it does seem like they're all flavors of the same thing but it's interesting to wonder like at which stage does something that we we would recognize as life in a sort of canonical silly human way and something that we would recognize as intelligence at which stage does that emerge like at which assembly index does that emerge and which assembly index is a consciousness something that we would canonically recognize as consciousness is this the use like this use of flavors the same as you meant when you were talking about flavors of alien and tell it like alien life yeah sure yeah i mean it's same as the flavors of ice cream and the flavors of fashion yeah like but we were talking about in terms of colors and like very nondescript but the way that you just talked about flavors now was more in like the space of consciousness and intelligence it was kind of like much more specific it'd be nice if there's a formal way of of expressing quantifying flavors quantifying flavors yeah it it seems like i would order it life consciousness intelligence probably as like the order in which things emerge and they're all just as a part of the same they're the same we're using the word life differently here i mean life sort of when i'm talking about what is a living versus a nonliving thing in a bar with a person i'm already like four or five drinks in that kind of thing just that like we're not we're not being too philosophical like here's the thing that moves and here's the thing that doesn't move and but maybe consciousness precedes that it's a weird dance there well like is life precede consciousness or consciousness precede life and i think that understanding of what life is in the way you're doing will help us disentangle that depending on what you wanna explain as i was saying before you have to assume something's fundamental and so because people can't explain consciousness there's a temptation for some people to wanna take consciousness as fundamental and assume everything else is derived out of that and then you you get some people that wanna assume consciousness preceded life and i don't i don't find either of those views particularly illuminating i think because i don't i don't wanna assume a feminology before i explain a thing and so what i've tried really hard to do is is not assume that i think life is anything except hold on to sort of the patterns and structures that seem to be the sort of consistent ways that we talk about this thing and then try to build a physics that describes that and i think that's a really different approach than saying you know consciousness is this thing you know we all feel and experience about things i would wanna understand the regularities associated with that and build a deeper structure underneath that and build into it i wouldn't wanna assume that thing and that i understand that thing which is usually how i see people talk about it the difference between life and consciousness yeah which which comes first yeah so i think if you're thinking about this sort of thinking about living things as these giant causal structures or these objects that are deep in time or whatever language we end up using to describe it it seems to me that consciousness is about the fact that we have a conscious experience is because we are these temporally extended objects so consciousness and the abstraction that we have in our minds is actually a manifestation of all the time that's rolled up in us and it's just because we're so huge that we have this very large inner space that we're experiencing that's not and it's also separated off from the rest of the world because we're the separate thread in time and so our consciousness is not exactly shared with anything else because nothing else occupies the same part of time that we occupy but i can understand something about you maybe being conscious because you and i didn't separate that far in the past in terms of our causal histories so in some sense we can even share experiences with each other through language because of that sort of overlap in our structure well then if consciousness is merely temporal separateness then that comes before life it's not merely temporal separateness it's about the depth in that time so it's yes the reason that my conscious experience is not the same as yours is because we're separated in time the fact that i have a conscious experience is because i'm an object that's super deep in time so i'm huge in time and that means that there's a lot there that i am basically in some sense a universe onto myself because my structure is so large relative to the amount of space that i occupy but it feels like that's possible to do before you get anything like bacteria i think there's a horizon and i don't know how to articulate this yet it's a little bit like the horizon at the origin of life where the space inside a particular structure becomes so large that it has some access to a space that's not that doesn't feel as physical it's almost like this idea of counterfactuals so i think like the the past history of your horizon is just much larger than can be encompassed in like a small configuration of matter so you you can like pull this stuff into existence this property is maybe a continuous property but there's something really different about human level physical systems and human level ability to understand reality i really love david deutsch's conception of universal explainers and like and that's related to the theory of universal computation and i think there's some transition that happens there but maybe maybe to describe that a little bit better what i can also say is like what intelligence is in this this framework so you have these these these objects that are you know large in time they were selected to exist by constraining the possible space of objects to this particular like all of the matter is funneled into this this particular configuration of object over time and so these objects arise through selection but the more selection that you have embedded in you the more selection where selection happened in the past but objects that are high density configurations of matter that have a lot of selection in them are also selecting agents in the universe so they actually embody the physics of selection and they can select on possible futures and i guess what i'm saying with respect to consciousness and the experience we have is that there's something very deep about that structure and the nature of how we exist in that structure that has to do with how how we're navigating that space and how we generate that space and how we continue to persist in that space is there shortcuts we can take to artificially engineering living organisms artificial life artificial consciousness artificial intelligence so maybe just looking pragmatically at the llms we have now do you think those can exhibit qualities of life qualities of consciousness qualities of intelligence in the way we think of intelligence i mean i think they already do but not in the way i hear popularly discussed so they're obviously signatures of intelligence and and and a part of a ecosystem of intelligence systems but i don't know that individually you know i would assign all the properties to them that people have it's a little like so you know we talked about the history of eyes before and like how eyes scaled up into technological forms and language has also had a really interesting history and got much more interesting i think once we started writing it down and then you know in inventing books and things but like you know every time that we started storing know every time that we started storing language in a new way you know we're kinda existentially traumatized by it so like you know the idea of written language was traumatic because it seemed like the dead were speaking to us even though they were deceased and books were traumatic because you know like suddenly there were lots of copies of this information available to everyone and it was gonna somehow dilute dilute it and large language models are kind of interesting because they don't feel as static they're very dynamic but if you think about language in the way i was describing before is language is this very large and time structure and before it had been something that was distributed over human brains as a dynamic structure and occasionally we store components of that very large dynamic structure in books or in written language now we can actually store the dynamics of that structure in a physical artifact which is a large language model and so i think about it almost like the evolution of genomes in some sense where you know there might have been like really primitive genes on the first living things and they could they didn't store a lot of information or they were like really messy and then we you know like you by the time you get to the eukaryotic cell you have this really dynamic genetic architecture that's readwritable right and like and has all of these different properties and i think large language models are kind of like the genetic system for language in some sense where it's it's allowing an a sort of archiving that's highly dynamic and i think it's very paradoxical to us because obviously in human history we haven't been used to conversing with anything that's not human but now we can converse basically with a crystallization of human language in a computer that's a highly dynamic crystal because it's a crystallization in time of this massive abstract structure that's evolved over human history and is now put into a small device i think crystallization kind of implies a limit on its capabilities i think there's not i mean it very purposefully because a particular instantiation of a language model trained on a particular dataset becomes a crystal of the language at that time it was trained but obviously we're iterating with the technology and evolving it i guess the question is when you crystallize it when you compress it when you archive it you're archiving some slice of the collective intelligence of the human species that's right and the question is like how powerful is that right it's a societal level technology right we've actually put collective intelligence in a box yeah i mean how much smarter is the collective intelligence of humans versus a single human and that's that's the question of agi versus human level intelligence superhuman level intelligence versus human level intelligence like how much smarter can this thing when done well when we solve a lot of the complexity computation complexities maybe there's some data complexities and how to really archive this thing crystallize this thing really well yeah how powerful is this thing gonna be like what's your guess i think i i don't like the sort of language we use around that and i think the language really matters so i don't know how to talk about how much smarter one human is than another right like usually we talk about abilities or particular talent someone has and you know going back to you know david duyshe's idea of universal explainers like you know adopting the view that you know we're the first you know kinds of structures our biosphere has built that can understand the rest of reality we have this universal comprehension capability you know he makes an argument that basically we're the first things that actually are capable of understanding anything it doesn't matter it doesn't mean an individual understands everything but like we're we have that capability and so there's not a difference between that and what people talk about with agi in some sense agi is a universal explainer but you know like it might be that a computer is much more efficient at doing you know i don't know prime factorization or something than a human is but it doesn't mean that it's necessarily smarter or has a broader reach of the kind of things that can understand than a human does and so i think we really have to think about is it a level shift or is it we're enhancing certain kinds of capabilities humans have in the same way that we can enhance eyesight by making telescopes and microscopes are we enhancing capabilities we have into technologies and the entire global ecosystem is getting more intelligent or is it really that we're building some super machine in a box that's gonna be smart and kill everybody like i'd like that sounds like a science like it's not it's not even a science fiction narrative it's a bad science fiction narrative i like i just don't think it's actually accurate to any of the technologies we're building or the way that we should be describing them it's not even how we should be describing ourselves so the benevolent story is there's a benevolent system that's able to transform our economy our way of life by just you know ten x ing the gdp if well these are human questions right i don't think they're necessarily questions that we're gonna like outsource to an artificial intelligence i think what is happening and will continue to happen is there's a coevolution between humans and technology that's happening and we're coexisting in this ecosystem right now and we're maintaining a lot of the balance and for the balance to shift to the technology would require some very bad human actors which is a real risk or some sort of i don't know some sort of dynamic that favors like i i just don't know how that plays out without human agency actually trying to put it in that direction it could also be how rapid the rate the rapid rate is scary so like i think the things that are you know terrifying are you know the ideas of deep fakes or you know like you know all the the kinds of issues that become legal issues issues about artificial intelligence technologies and using them to control weapons or using them for you know like child pornography or you know like the or like you know faking out that someone's you know loved one was kidnapped or killed and it you know like and rans like there's all kinds of things that are super scary in this landscape and all kinds of new legislation needs to be built and all kinds of guardrails on the technology to make sure that people don't abuse it need to be built and that needs to happen and i think one function of sort of the artificial intelligence doomsday sort of part of our culture right now is it's sort of our immune response to knowing that's coming and we're over scaring ourselves so we try to act more quickly which is good but i i i just you know it's it's about the words that we use versus the actual things happening behind the words i think one thing that's good is when people are talking about things different ways it makes us think about them and also when things are existentially threatening we wanna pay attention to those but the ways that they're threatening and the ways that we're experiencing existential trauma i don't think that we're really going to understand for another century or two if ever and i certainly think they're not the way that we're describing them now well creating existential trauma is one of the things that makes life fun i guess yeah it's just what we do to ourselves it gives us really exciting big problems to solve yeah for sure do you think we will see these ai systems become conscious or convince us that they're conscious and then maybe we'll have relationships with them romantic relationships well i think people are gonna have romantic relationships with them and i also think that some people will be convinced already that they're conscious but i think in order you know what does it take to convince convince people that something is conscious i think that we actually have to have an idea of what we're talking about that it's like it's like we have to have a theory that explains when things are conscious or not that's testable right and we don't have one right now so i think until we we have that it's always gonna be this sort of gray area where some people think it hasn't some people think it doesn't because we don't actually know what we're talking about that we think it has so do you think it's possible to get out of the gray area and really have a formal test for consciousness for sure and and for life as you were for sure as we've been talking about for somebody to yeah consciousness is a tricky one it is a tricky one i mean that's why it's called the hard problem of consciousness because it's hard and you know it might even be outside of the purview of science which means that we can't understand it in a scientific way there might be other ways of coming to understand it but that those may not be the ones that we necessarily want for technological utility or for developing laws with respect to because the laws are are you know the things that are gonna govern the technology well i i think that's actually where the the hard problem of consciousness a different hard problem of consciousness is that i fear that humans will resist that's the last thing they will resist is calling something else conscious oh that's interesting i think it depends on the culture though because i mean some cultures already think like everything's imbued with you know a life essence or kind of conscious i don't think those cultures have nuclear weapons no they don't they're probably not building the most advanced technologies the cultures that are primed for destroying each other constructing a very effective propaganda machines of what the other is the group to hate are the are the cultures that i worry would yeah i know would would be very resistant to label something and so to sort of acknowledge the consciousness laden in a thing that was created by us humans and so what do you think the risks are there that the conscious things will get angry with us and fight back no that that would that we would torture and kill conscious beings oh yeah i think we do that quite a lot anyway without i i mean i i i don't i i mean it goes back to your and i i don't know how to feel about this but you know like we talked already about the predator prey thing that like in some sense you know being alive requires eating other things that are alive and even if you're a vegetarian or you know like try to have like you're like you're still eating living things i yeah so maybe part of the the story of earth will involve a predator prey dynamic between humans that's strong for existence creations yeah and all of that is part of the text like thinking about them as a like our technologies as a separate species because this again goes back to this sort of levels of selection issue and you know if you think about humans individually alive you miss the fact that societies are also alive and so i think about it much more in the sense of i i an ecosystem is not the right word but we don't have the right words for these things of like and this is why i talk about the technosphere it's a system that is both human and technological it's not human or technological and so this is the part that i think we're really good for the like and this is driving in part a lot of the sort of attitude of like i'll kill you first with my nuclear weapons we're really good at identifying things as other we're not really good at understanding when we're the same or when we're part of an integrated system that's actually functioning together in some kind of cohesive way so even if you look at like you know the division in american politics or something for example it's important that there's multiple sides that are arguing with each other because that's actually how you resolve society's issues it's not like a bad feature i think like some of the sort of extreme positions and like the way people talk about it are maybe not ideal but but that's how societies solve problems what it looks like for an individual is really different than the societal level outcomes and the fact that like there is i don't wanna call it cognition or computation i don't know what you call it but like there is a process playing out in the dynamics of societies that we are all individual actors in and like we're not part of that you know like it requires all of us acting individually but like this higher level structure is playing out some things and like things are getting solved for it to be able to maintain itself and that's the level that our technologies live at they don't live at our level they live at the societal level and they're deeply integrated with the social organism if you wanna call it that and so i really get upset when people talk about the species of artificial intelligence i'm like you mean we live in an ecosystem of all these kind of intelligent things and these animating invented a new species all of these things get scaffolded and we're also augmenting ourselves at the same time that we're building technologies i don't think we can anticipate what that system's gonna look like so in some fundamental way you always wanna be thinking about the planet as one organism the planet is one living thing what happens when it becomes multiplanetary is it still just the still the same causal chain same causal chain it's like when the first cell split into two that's what i was talking about when the when a planet reproduces itself the technosphere emerges enough understanding it's it's it's like this recursive like the entire history of life is just recursion right so you have an original life event it evolves for four billion years at least on our planet it evolves a technosphere the technologies themselves start to become having this property we call life which is the phase we're undergoing now it solves the origin of itself and then it figures out how that process all works understands how to make more life and then can copy itself onto another planet so the whole structure can reproduce itself and so the original life is happening again right now on this planet in the technosphere with the way that our planet is undergoing another transition just like at the origin of life when geochemistry transition to biology which is the global for me it was a planetary scale transition it was a multi scale thing that happened from the scale of chemistry all the way to planetary cycles it's happening now all the way from individual humans to the internet which is a global technology and all the other things like there's this multiscale process that's happening and transitioning us globally and it is really like it's a dramatic transition it's happening really and you think and we're living in it you think this techno sphere that we're created this increasingly complex techno sphere will spread to other planets it'll just be so i think so you think we'll become a type two kardashev civilization i don't really like the kardashev scale and i it it goes back to like i don't like a lot of the narratives about life because they're very like you know survival of the fittest energy consuming this that and the other thing it's very like i don't know sort of old world you know like conqueror mentality what's the alternative to that exactly i mean i think it does require life to use new energy sources in order to expand the way it is so that part's accurate but i think this sort of process of life like being the the mechanism that the universe creatively expresses itself generates novelty explores the space of the possible is really the thing that's most intrinsic to life and so you know these sort of energy consuming scales of technology i think is missing the sort of actual feature that's most prominent about any alien life that we might find which is that it's literally our universe our reality trying to creatively express itself and trying to find out what can exist and trying to make it exist see but past a a certain level of complexity unfortunately maybe you can correct me but we're built all complex life on earth is built on a foundation of that predator prey dynamic yes and so like i don't know if we can escape that i don't know we can't but the but this is why i'm okay with having a finite lifetime and i you know one of the reasons i'm okay with that actually yeah goes back to this issue of the fact that we're resource bound we live in a you know like we have a finite amount of material whatever way you wanna define material i think like for me you know material is time material is information but we have a finite amount of material if time is generating mechanism it's always gonna be finite because the universe is you know like it's it's it's a resource that's getting generated but it has a size which means that all the things that could exist don't exist and in fact most of them never will so death is a way to make room in the universe for other things to exist that wouldn't be able to exist otherwise so if the universe over its entire temporal history wants to maximize the number of things wants is a hard word maximize a hard word all these things are approximate but wants to maximize the number of things that can exist the best way to do it is to make recursively embedded stacked objects like us that have a lot of structure and a small volume of space and to have those things turn over rapidly so you can create as many of them as possible so there for sure is a bunch of those kinds of things throughout the universe hopefully hopefully our universe is teeming with life this is like early on in the conversation you mentioned that we really don't understand much like there's mystery all around us yes if you had to like bet money on it like what percent so like say a million years from now the story of science and human understanding understanding that started on earth is written like what chapter are we on are we like is this like one percent ten percent twenty percent fifty percent ninety percent how much do we understand like the big stuff not not like the details of like big important questions yeah and ideas i think we're in our twenties and twenty percent of the twenty percent no like age wise let's say we're in our twenties but the lifespan is gonna keep getting longer you can't do that i can you know why i use that though i'll tell you why why my brain went there is because you know anybody that gets an education in physics you know has this sort of trope about how all the great physicists did their best work in their twenties and then you don't do any good work after that and i always thought it was kind of funny because for me physics is not complete it's not nearly complete but most physicists think that we understand most of the structure of reality and so i i think i i actually i think i put this in the book somewhere but like this idea to me that societies would discover everything while they're young is very consistent with the way we talk about physics right now mhmm but i don't think that's actually the way that things are gonna go and you're you're finding that people that are making major discoveries are getting older in some sense than they were and our lifespan is also increasing so i think there is something about age and your ability to learn and how much of the world you can see that's really important over a human lifespan but also over the lifespan of societies and so i don't know how big the frontier is i don't actually think it has a limit i don't believe in infinity as a physical thing but i think as a receding horizon i think because the universe is getting bigger you can never know all of it well i think it's about one point seven percent one point seven where does that come from a finite i don't know i just made it up but but it's like that number had to come from somewhere it certainly i think seven is the thing that people usually pick seven percent so i i wanted to say one percent but i thought it'd be funnier yeah i get it point you know so humor inject a little humor in there so the seven is for the humor one is for how much mystery i think there is out there ninety nine percent mystery one percent known in terms of like really big important questions yeah it's like the list say there's gonna be like two hundred chapters like the stuff that's gonna remain true but you think the book has a finite size yeah yeah and i don't i mean it it not that i believe in infinities but i don't i think the size of the book is growing well the fact that the size of the book is growing is one of the chapters in the book oh there you go oh we're we're being recursive i think you have to you can't you can't have an ever growing book yes you can you i mean you just i mean i don't even because then well you couldn't have been asking this at the origin of life right because obviously like you wouldn't have been existed at the origin of life but like the question of intelligence and artificial general like those questions did not exist then mhmm and so and they in part existed because the universe invented a space for those questions to exist through evolution but like i think that question will still stand a thousand years from now it will but there will be other questions we can't anticipate now that we'll be asking yeah and maybe we'll develop the kinds of languages that we'll be able to ask much better questions right or like like the theory of like gravitation for example like when we invented that theory like we only knew about the planets in our solar system right and now you know many centuries later we know about all these planets around other stars and black holes and other things that we could never have anticipated so and then we can ask questions about them you know like we wouldn't have been asking about singularities and like can they really be physical things in the universe several hundred years ago that question couldn't exist yeah but it's not i still think those are chapters in a book like i don't get a sense from that so do you think the universe has an end if you think it's a book with an end i think the number of words required to describe how the universe works as an end yes meaning like i don't care if it's infinite or not right as long as the explanation is simple and it exists oh i see and i think there is a finite explanation for each aspect of it the consciousness the life yeah i mean very probably there's like some the black hole thing is like what's going on there alright where is that going like where did they what and then you know why the big bang like what right it's probably there's just a huge number of universes and it was like universes inside universe i think universes inside universes is maybe possible i just think it's it every time we assume this is all there is it it turns out there's much more the universe is a huge place and we we mostly talked about the past and the richness of the past but the future i mean with with many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics so oh i am not a many worlds person you're not nope are you how many lexus are there depending on the day well do some of them wear yellow jackets at the at the moment we asked the question there was one at the moment i'm answering it there's not in in near infinity apparently i mean the future is is the future is bigger than the past yes yes okay well they in the past according to and i'm actually gigantic yeah but yeah i mean that's consistent with many worlds right because like there's this constant branching so but it doesn't really have a directionality to it it's it's a i don't know many worlds is weird so my interpretation of reality is like if you fold it up like all that bifurcation of many worlds and you just fold it into the structure that is you and you just said you are all of those many worlds and like that sort of you know like like your history like converged on you but you're like you're you're actually an object exists that's like that you know was selected to exist and you're self consistent with the other structures so like the quantum mechanical reality is is not the one that you live in it's this very deterministic classical world and you're carving a path through that space but i don't think that you're constantly branching into new spaces i think you are that space wait so to you at at the bottom it's it's deterministic it's i thought you said the universe no it's random at the bottom right but like this randomness that we see at the bottom of reality that is quantum mechanics i think like people have assumed that that is reality and what i'm saying is like all those things you see in many worlds all those versions of you just collect them up and bundle them up and like they're all you and what has happened is you know like elementary particles don't have they don't live in a deterministic universe the things that we study in quantum experiments they live in this fuzzy random space but as that structure collapsed and started to build structures that were deterministic and evolved into you you are a very deterministic microscopic macroscopic object and you can look down on that universe that doesn't have time in it that random structure and you can see that all of these possibilities look possible but they don't look they're not possible for you because you're constrained by this giant like causal structural history so you can't live in all those universes you'd have to go all the way back to the very beginning of the universe and retrace everything again to be a deterministic structure living in a random background and also all of that selection bundled in you allows you to select on possible futures so that's where your will comes from and there's just always a little bit of randomness because the universe is getting bigger and you know like this idea that the past is and the present is not large enough yet to contain the future the extra structure has to come from somewhere and some of that is because outside of those giant causal structures that are things like us it's fucking random out there and it's scary and we're all hanging on to each other because the only way to hang on to each other like the only way to exist is to like cling on to all of these causal structures that we happen to co inhabitate existence with and try to keep reinforcing each other's existence all the selection bundled in enough but but free will's totally consistent with that i don't know what i think about that that's complicated to imagine just that little bit of randomness is enough okay well it's also it's not just the randomness there's two features one is the randomness helps generate some novelty and some flexibility but it's also that like because you're you're you're the structure that's deep in time you have this combinatorial history that's you and i think about time and assembly theory not as linear time but as combinatorial time so if you have all of the structure that you're built out of you in principle you know your future can be combinations of that structure you obviously need to persist yourself as a coherent you so you wanna optimize for a common like a a a future in that combinatorial space that still includes you most of the time for most of us and and when you make those kinds and then that gives you a space to operate in and that's your sort of horizon where your free will can operate and your free will can't be instantaneous so for like example like i'm sitting here talking to you right now i can't be in the uk and i can't be in arizona but i could plan i could execute my free will over time because free will is a temporal feature of life to be there you know tomorrow or the or the next day if i wanted to but what about like the instantaneous decisions you're making like the i don't know to put your hand on the table that's i think those were already decided a while ago i don't think they're they're i don't think free will is ever instantaneous but on a longer time horizon yep there's some kind of steering going on mhmm and who's doing the steering you are and you being this macro object that's encompasses or you being lex whatever you wanna call it there there you are saying words to things once again i know why does anything exist at all ugh you've kind of taken that as a starting point yeah it exists i think that's the hardest question isn't it just hard questions stacked on top of each other it is well wouldn't it be the same kind of question of what is life it is the same well that's that's sort of like i try to fold all of the questions into that question because i think that one's really hard and i think the nature of existence is really hard you think actually like answering what is life will help us understand existence maybe maybe there's it's it's turtles all the way down it'll it'll just under understanding the nature of turtles will help us kinda march down even if we don't have the experimental methodology of reaching before the big bang right so well i think there's there's sort of two questions embedded here i think the one that we can answer by answering life is why certain things exist and others don't but i think the sort of ultimate question the sort of like prime mover question of why anything exists we will not be able to answer what's outside the universe oh there's nothing outside the universe so i i have a very i am a very like i am like the most physicalist that like anyone could be so like for me everything exists in our universe and it it and like i like to like think it like everything exists here so even when we talk about the multiverse i don't like to me it's not like there's all these other universes outside of our universe that exist the multiverse is a concept that exists in human minds here and it allows us to have some counterfactual reasoning to reason about our own cosmology and therefore it's causal in our biosphere to understanding the reality that we live in and building better theories but i don't think that the multiverse is something like and and also math like i don't think there's a platonic world that mathematical things live in i think mathematical things are here on this planet like i don't think it makes sense to talk about things that exist outside of the universe if you're talking about them you're already talking about something that exists inside the universe and is part of the universe and is part of like what the universe is building it it all originates here it all exists here in some way i mean what else would there be there could be things you can't possibly understand outside of all of this that we call the universe but and you can say that and that's an interesting philosophy but again this is sort of like pushing on the boundaries of like the way that we understand things i think it's more constructive to say the fact that i can talk about those things is telling me something about the structure of where i actually live and where i exist just because it's more constructive doesn't mean it's true well it may not be true it may be something that allows me to build better theories i can test yes to try to understand something objective and in the end that's a good way to get to the truth exactly even if you realize so i can't do it there wrong in the past yeah so there's no such thing as experimental platonism but if you think mass is an object that emerged in our biosphere you can start experimenting with that idea and that to me is really interesting like to think about well people i mean mathematicians do think about math sometimes as experimental science but to think about math itself as a as object for study by physicists rather than a tool physicists use to describe reality it becomes the part of reality they're trying to describe to me is a deeply interesting inversion what to you is most beautiful about this kind of exploration of the physics of life that you've been doing i love the way it makes me feel and then you have to try to convert the feelings into visuals and the visuals into words so i think i love yeah i love the way it makes me feel to have ideas that i think are novel and i think that the dual side of that is the painful process of trying to communicate that with other human beings to test if they have any kind of reality to them and i also love that process i love trying to figure out how to explain really deep abstract things that i don't think that we understand and trying to understand them with other people and i also love the shock value of you like this kind of idea we were talking about before of like being on the boundary of like what we understand and so people can kind of see what you're seeing but they haven't ever saw it that way before and i i i love the shock value that like people have like that immediate moment of recognizing that there's something beyond the way that they thought about things before and being able to deliver that to people i think is one of the biggest joys that i have is just like and maybe it's that sense of mystery like to share that there's something beyond the frontier of how we understand and we might be able to see it and you get to see the humans transformed yeah with an idea yes and i think my my greatest wish in life is to somehow contribute to an idea that some that transforms the way that we think like you know i have my problem i wanna solve but like the thing that gives me joy about it is really changing something and ideally getting to a deeper understanding of how the world works and what we are yeah i would say understanding life at a deep level yeah is probably one of the most exciting problems one of the most exciting questions so i'm glad you're trying to answer just that and doing it in style it's the only way to do anything thank you so much for this amazing conversation thank you for being you sarah this was awesome thanks lex thanks for listening to this conversation with sarah walker to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from charles darwin in the long history of humankind and animal kind too those who learn to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
