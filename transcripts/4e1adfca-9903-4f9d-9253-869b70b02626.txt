the following is a conversation with edward frenkel one of the greatest living mathematicians doing research on the interface of mathematics and quantum physics with an emphasis on the langlands program which he describes as a grand unified theory of mathematics he also is the author of love and math the heart of hidden reality and now a quick use second mention of each sponsor check them out

free this is a lex fridman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's edward franco you open your book love and math with a question how does one become a mathematician there are many ways that this can happen let me tell you how it happened to me so how did it happen to you so first of all i grew up in the soviet union in a small town near moscow called kalona and i was a smart kid you know in school but mathematics was probably my least favorite subject not because i couldn't do it i was you know a straight a student and i could do all the problems easily but i thought it was incredibly boring and since the only math i knew was what was presented at school i thought that was it and i was like what kind of boring subject is this so what i really liked was physics and especially quantum physics so i was buying i was i would go to a bookstore and buy popular books about elementary particles and atoms and things like that and read them you know devour them and so i thought i my dream was to become a theoretical physicist and to delve into this finer structure of the universe you know so then something happened when i was fifteen years old it turns out that a friend of my parents was a mathematician who was a professor at the local college it was a small college preparing educators teachers it's a provincial town imagine it's like hundred seventeen kilometers from moscow which would be something like seventy miles i guess mhmm you do the math i like how you remember the number exactly yeah isn't it funny how we remember numbers yeah so his name was evgeny evgenyevitch petrov yeah and if this doesn't remind you of the great works of russian literature then you haven't read them like war and peace you know like with the patronymic names yeah but this was all real this was all happening so my mom one day by chance met evgenyevgenyevich and told him about me that i was this bright kid and interested in physics and he said oh i wanna meet him i'm going to convert him into math and my mom was like nah math he doesn't like mathematics so they said okay let's let's see what i can do so i went to see him so i'm about fifteen and a bit a bit arrogant i would say you know like everest teenager so he says to me so i hear that you are interested in in physics elementary particles i said yeah sure and so for example do you know about quarks and i said yes of course i know about quarks quarks are the you know constituents of particles like protons and neutrons and it was one of the greatest discoveries in theoretical physics in the sixties that those particles were not elementary but in fact had the smaller parts and he said oh so then you probably know representation theory of group su three i said like i see what so in fact i wanted to know what was what were the underpinnings of those theories i knew the story i knew the narrative i knew kind of this basic story of what these particles look like but how did physicists come up with these ideas mhmm how were they able to theorize them and so i remembered you know like it was yesterday so he pulls out a book and it's kind of like like a bible you know like a like a substantial book and he opens them it's in the somewhere in the middle and there i see the diagrams that i saw in popular books but in popular books there was no explanation and now i see all these weird symbols and equations it it's clear that it is explained in there oh my god he said you think what they teach you at school is mathematics it's like no this is real mathematics so i was instantly converted that you understand the underpinnings of physical reality you have to understand what s u three is you have to learn what are groups what is group s u three what are representations of su three there was a coherent and beautiful i could appreciate the beauty even though i could not understand heads and tails of it but you were drawn to the the methodology the the the machinery of how such understanding could be attained well in retrospect i think what i was really craving was a deeper understanding and up to that point the deepest that i could see was were those diagrams but or that story that you know a proton consists of three quarks and a neutron consists of three quarks and they're called up and down and so on but i didn't know that there was actually underneath beneath the surface there was this mathematical theory if you can just linger on it what drew you to quantum mechanics is there some romantic notion of understanding the universe what what is interesting to you is it the puzzle of it or is it like the philosophical thing now i am looking back yeah so whatever i say about edward at fifteen yeah is colored by my you know all my experiences that happen in in the meantime i should say for current views and so on for the people who may not know you i think your book and your presentations kinda revealed that that fifteen year old is still in there somewhere well i take it as a compliment some of the joy he's probably still here now yes yeah in some way yeah i think it was a joy of discovery and the joy of going deeper into the kind of the to the root to the to to the deepest structures of the universe the secrets the the the secrets and we may not discover all of them we may not be able to understand but we're going to try and go as far and as deep as we can i think that's what was the motivating factor in this yeah there's this mystery there's this dark room and there's a few of these mathematical physicists they're able to shine a flashlight briefly into there we'll we'll talk about it but it also kinda makes me sad that there's so few of your kind that have the the flashlight to look into the room it's interesting i don't think there are so few to be honest because i think i find a lot of people are actually interested if you do talk if you talk to peep you know like some people you wouldn't expect to to be interested in this from all walks of life from people of all kinds of professions i tell them i'm a mathematician and they i'm a mathematician okay so that's a separate story a lot of people i think have been traumatized by their experience in their math classes we can talk about it later but then they asked me what kind of research i do and i i mentioned that i i work on the interface of math and quantum physics and their eyes light up it's like oh quantum physics or like einstein's relativity why are you really curious about it i watch this podcast or i watch that podcast you know and i've i've learned this it's like what do you think about that yeah so i actually find that actually physicists are doing great job educating the public so to speak and in terms of popular books and videos and so on mathematicians are behind we're starting to catch up a little bit have been starting last ten years but we're still behind but i think people are curious science is is still very much you know something that people want to learn because that's our kind of the best way we know to establish some sort of objective reality whatever that might be yeah and to figure out this whole puzzle to figure out the secrets that the universe holds things that we can agree on kind of you know like even though for me at this point i always you know make an argument that our physical theories always change they get updated so you had newton's theory of gravity then einstein's theory you know superseded it but in mathematics it seems that theories don't change pythagoras theorem has been the same for the last two thousand five hundred years x squared plus y squared equals z squared we don't expect that next year suddenly it will be z cubed mhmm you know so and so that to me is actually even more hints even more at how how how much we are connected to each other because pythagoras theory if you think about it or any other mathematical theory means the same thing to anyone in the world today regardless of their cultural you know upbringing religion you know ideas idea ideology gender whatever nationality race whatever right and it has meant the same mhmm to everyone everywhere and most likely will mean the same so that's to me kind of an antidote to the kind of divisiveness that we sometimes observe these days where it seems that we can't agree on anything to the political complexity of two plus two equals five in george orwell's nineteen eighty four i was in the soviet union in nineteen eighty four and so in many ways i see that it was prescient the the novel was prescient but we still have not found a dictator who would actually say two plus two equals five and would demand their citizens to repeat that the night is still young has not happened yet yeah but it does feel like math and physics are both sneaking up to a deep truth from slightly different angles and you stand at the crossroads or at the intersection of the two it's interesting to ask what do you think is the difference between physics and mathematics in the way physics and mathematics look at the world there there is actually an essential difference which is that physicists are interested in describing this universe okay mathematicians are interested in describing all possible mathematical universes of which you know in some of our work i still consider myself more of a mathematician than a physicist my first love for physics not notwithstanding mathematicians are we in a way we have more diversity if you if you you might say so we we are accepting for instance our universe has three spatial dim spatial dimensions and one time dimension right so what i mean is that allegedly allegedly observed but that way we can observe today right so of course there are theories where there are some hidden dimensions as well well let's just say observe observe dimensions so this tabletop has two dimensions because you can have two axis two coordinate axis x and y but then there is also a third one to describe the space of this room and then there is a time time dimension so realistic theories of physics have to be about spaces of of three three dimensions or space times of four dimensions but mathematically we are just as interested in theories in ten space time dimensions or eleven or twenty five or whatever or or infinite dimensional spaces you know so that's the difference on the other hand i have to give it to the physicists we don't have the same satisfaction that they have of having their theories confirmed by an experiment we don't get to play with big machines like lhc in geneva large hadron collider that recently discovered you know the higgs boson and some other things for us it's all like a mental exercise in some sense we do we prove things by using rules of logic and that's our way of confirming experimental confirmation if you will but i think we kind of i kind of envy a little bit my friends physicists that they get to they get to experience this sort of this big toys you know and play with them but it does seem that sometimes as you've spoken about abstract mathematical concepts map to reality and it seems to happen quite a bit that's right so the mathematics is underpins physics obviously it's a language the the the book of nature as galileo famously said is written in the language of mathematics and and you know the the letters in it are the circles triangles and squares and those who don't know the language i'm paraphrasing are left to wander in a dark labyrinth that's a famous quote from galileo which is very true and has become even more true more recently in theoretical physics in the more in the most sort of far out parts of the theoretical physics that have to do with elementary particles and and as well as the the structure of the cosmos at the large scale what do you think of max tegmark who wrote the book mathematical universe mhmm so do you think just lingering on that point you think at the end of the day the future generations will all be mathematicians i know i know i know meaning meaning the ones that deeply understand the way the universe works at the core is it just mathematics at the core of you know i would say mathematics is one half of the core so the book is called love and math okay so these are the two pillars if you will yeah in my view yes in other words you can't cover everything by math so math mathematics gives you tools it gives you way a a kind of a clear vision but mathematics by itself is not enough for one to have a harmonious and and balanced life you know so i i am suspicious of any theory that declares that everything is mathematics so math can generate things that are beautiful but it can't explain why it's beautiful math you could say is a way to discern patterns to find regularities yeah in the universe and both physical and mental universe mhmm and the mathematics explores the mind as much as it explores the physical world around us and it helps us to find those patterns which kind of which makes our perception more sophisticated our ability to perceive things such as beauty you know and it sharpens our ability to see to see beauty to understand beauty so our world becomes more complex from thinking that our that our that that earth is flat we go to realizing that it is round that it's shaped as a sphere so that we can actually travel around the earth you know so there isn't a place where we hit the end so to speak and then proceeding in the same vein then einstein's general relativity theory tells us that our space time is not flat either this is much harder to to imagine the bent a bent three-dimensional or four dimensional three-dimensional space or four dimensional space time because this idea that the space around us is flat is so deeply entrenched mhmm and yet we know from this from this theory and from the experiments that have confirmed it that a re a ray of light bends around a star as if being attracted by the by the force of gravity but in fact the force of gravity is the bending it's just that it's not only the bending of the space it's also the bending of space time there is a curvature not only between special spatial dimensions the way parallels and meridians come together in a small scale they look like perpendicular lines but if you zoom out you see that the space are they're curving the space they are sort of the tracks along which the space gets curved that's that's the that would be the curvature of spatial dimensions but in fact now throw in time and one time imagine a sphere which lives which has one of the meridians correspond to time and the parallels correspond to space i can't imagine it but you can write i can write mathematical formula expressing that curvature and that's in fact that curvature is responsible for the force of gravity attraction between the the sort of simplest instantiation of it attraction between two planets or between two human beings for that matter yeah the time bending time it's not very nice that what that theory did to time because it feels like the marching of time forward is fundamental to our human experience the arrow of time marching forward nicely seems to be the only way we can understand the universe and the fact that you can start up to now up to now there are people who claim that they can that they have they possess other ways of of experiencing it so truly can visualize messing with time well messing with time but not necessarily messing with time because one point of view is that you know i think who who was it i think william blake who wrote that eternity loves time production so one point of view is that it is eternity which is fundamental where time stands still which our mind conceptualizes as the time so but in fact you know it's not something mystical if you think about when you about it when you really absorbed in something time does stand still and then you look at the clock and it's like oh my god two hours have passed and it felt like a couple of seconds when you are absorbed when you're in love when you are passionate about something when you're creating something you're we lose ourselves and we lose the sense of time and space for that matter you see so there is only that which is happening that creative process so i think that this this is familiar to all of us and we may be actually the closest to the truth at that moment to the true nature of the knowledge so yes so then there is a point of view that this is where we are we are who we are at our sort of fundamental at our fundamental level and after that the mind comes in and tries to conceptualize it it's like oh because i was writing something i was writing a book i was painting this painting or maybe i was watching this painting and got totally absorbed in it or i fell in love with this person that's what happened but in the moment when it's happening you're not thinking about it you're just there yeah we construct narratives around the set of memories that that seem to have happened in sequence or at least that's the way we tell ourselves that and we also have a bunch of weird human things like consciousness and the experience of free will that we chose a set of actions as the time unrolled forward right and we are intelligent conscious agents making taking those actions but what if all of that is just an illusion an illusion and a nice narrative we tell ourselves sure that's a really difficult thing to internalize and imagine imagine that to make it really catch twenty two uh-huh that our imagine that our minds and set are set up in such a way yeah that they can't approach the world or experience otherwise so in other words to understand to see that from a more kind of all encompassing point of view we have to step out of the mind mhmm well i wonder what's the more honest way to look at things but i think we like to be to play with time i think we like to play with these experiences with all the drama of it with all the memories with all the tribulations yeah i think this we love it we love it otherwise we wouldn't be doing it i think this or earth loves it the evolutionary process somehow loves it sure whatever whatever this thing that's being created here on earth it seems to like to create like to allow its children to play with certain yeah truths that they hold the subjective truths that are useful for the competition or whatever this dance that we call life broadly defined not just humans and and you know i'm i'm glad you mentioned that because what i find fascinating is that the greatest scientists are on record saying that when they were making their discoveries they felt like children so isaac newton said to myself i only appeared as a child playing on the seashore and every once in a while finding a prettier pebble or a prettier shell whilst i think he said something like the infinite ocean of knowledge laid was lying before me alexander grothendyck who probably was the greatest mathematician of the second half of the twentieth century the french mathematician alexander grotting wrote that discovery is a privilege of a child the child who is not afraid to be wrong once again to be able to look like an idiot you know to to to try this and that i'm i'm paraphrasing and go through trial and error that is for them in other words for them that innocence of a child who is not afraid who has not yet been told that it cannot be done okay that was essential to scientific pursuit to scientific discovery and now and now also compared to pablo picasso a great artist right so who said every every child is an artist the question is to how to preserve that as we grow up do you struggle with that you're one of the most respected mathematicians in the world you're berkeley you're like this this this statue you're supposed to be very like you know ivory towers yeah sometimes i joke i say i i i take i take an elevator to the top of the ivory tower every day yeah yeah and you're supposed to speak like royalty do you struggle to like strip all of that away to rediscover the child when you're thinking about problems when you're teaching when when you're thinking about the world absolutely i mean that's part of being human because when we grow up i mean all of them all of these great scientists i think they were so great in part because they were able they maintained that connection okay and that fascination that vulnerability that spontaneity you know and kind of looking at the world through the eyes of a child but it's difficult because you know you go through education system and for many of us it's not especially helpful for maintaining that connection that'd be kind of like we're being told certain things that we accept take for granted and so on and little by little and also we get hit every time we act different okay every time we act that doesn't in a way that doesn't fit sort of the pattern we get punished by the teachers get punished by parents and so on and don't get respect when you act childlike in in your thinking when you are fearless and looking like an idiot that's right because there's a hierarchy in society nobody wants to look like an idiot you know once you start growing up or you think you're growing up yeah in the beginning you don't even think of you don't think in these terms mhmm you just play you're just playing and you are open to possibilities to this infinite possibilities that this world presents to us so how do we i'm not saying that education system should not be also kind of taming that a little bit obviously the goal is balance that acquiring knowledge so that we can be more mature and more discerning more discriminating in terms of our approach to the world in terms of our connections to the world and people and so on but how do we do that while also preserving that innocence of a child and my guess is that there is no formula for this it is a life is an answer every life every human being is one particular answer to how do we find balance that's one imperfect approximation approximate solution to the problem but we could look we can look up to the great ones yeah who have credentials in the sense that they have shown and they have proved that they have done something that other humans appreciate our civilization appreciates say isaac newton or alexander grotendijk or pablo picasso so they have established their right to speak about these matters and we could not dismiss them as mere madmen they say okay well if if the same thing was said by somebody who never achieved anything in in that's in in their in their field of endeavor you would be it would be easy for us to dismiss it but when it comes from someone like isaac newton we take notice so i think that's something important that they they teach us and especially today in this age of ai of course there's a big elephant in the room always which is called ai yeah right and so i know that you are an expert in the subject and we are going we're living now in this very interesting times of new ai systems coming online pretty much every couple of weeks so i kind of to me that whole debate about what is it what is artificial intelligence where is it going what should we do about it needs an influx of this type of considerations that we've just been talking about that for instance the idea that inspiration creativity doesn't come from accumulation of knowledge because obviously child a child has not yet accumulated knowledge and yet the great ones are on record saying that a child has a capacity to to create and an adult credits the inner child the inner child yeah for this capacity to create as an adult you see that's kinda weird if we take the point of view that everything is computation everything is accumulation of knowledge that just bigger and bigger datasets finer and finer neural networks and then we will be able to replicate human consciousness if we take that point of view then what i just said kind of doesn't fit because obviously a child has not been fed any training data as far as we know yet they're perfectly capable of you know of distinguishing between cats and dogs for instance and stuff like that but much more than that they're also capable of that you know wide eyed in a sort of perspective so does can it really be captured that perspective that sense of awe can it really be captured by competition alone i actually i don't know the answer so i'm not sort of trying to to present a particular point of view i'm just trying to question any theory that starts out by saying life is this or consciousness is this because when you look more closely you recognize that there are some other things at play which do not quite fit the narrative and it's hard to know where they come from it's it's also possible that the evolutionary process has created is the very it is computation and the and the child is actually not a blank slate but the result of one of the most incredible several billion year old computations that that had explored all kinds of aspect of of life on earth of of war and love and terror and ambition and violence and invention all of that from the bacteria to today mhmm so like that young child is not is not a blank slate they're they're coming they're they're actually they hold within them the knowledge of several billions of years right the question is whether as a child you carry that in the form of the kind of computational algorithms that we are aware of today you see what what strikes me as unlikely is that how should i put it how interesting that you know we you you are a computer scientist and there are other people coming i have studied computer science so i know a little bit and so it's tempting to say oh the whole world is computer science or is based can be explained by computer science yes why because it makes me feel good because i have mastered it i have learned it my ego is very happy and people come to me and and and they look up to me and they revere me kind of like priests in old in old days when the religion was paramount when you would be would tend to explain things in theological religious terms today science has progressed there are fewer people who kind of buy into religion official religion you know so we have this urge i suppose to to explain and to know and to dissect and to analyze and to conceptualize which is a wonderful quality that we have and we should definitely pursue that but i find it a little bit unlikely that the universe is just exactly what i have learned and not something that i don't know you see well there's a lot of interesting aspects of the current large language models that one perspective of it i think speaks to the love and math mhmm that you talk to which is they're trained on human data from the internet so at its best a large language model like gpt four captures the magic of the human condition on its full display its full complexity it's just mimicking it's trying to compress all the weirdness of humans of all the debates and discussions the perspectives all the different ways that people approach solving different problems all of that compressed so we live we're each individual ants we only have like we have a family we interact with a few little ants and here comes ai that's able to summarize like a tldr report yeah of humanity and that's the beauty of it so i embrace it but i wonder if i'm very impressed by it i wonder if it can be very impressive meaning way more impressive in being able to fake or simulate or emulate a human than i'm glad you you mentioned that because that's just it seems to be the mantra it's just fake it till you make it yeah isn't it isn't that what we all do though no well yes we do that but we also do other things we can be truly in love we can be truly inspired when it is not fake i do believe call me romantic okay but i do believe and this is a very good i'm glad we are you're putting it in these terms because i've had conversations like that that yeah fake it till you make it but that's like that's what humans do yes we do that but not all the time so and that is debatable because also i speak from my own experience and that's where the first person perspective comes in the subjective view i cannot prove to you for instance or anyone else that there are certain moments in my life where i i am genuine i am pure so to speak when it's not faking it mhmm but i do i do have a tremendous certainty of it and that's a subjective certainty now i am as a scientist i'm also trained to give more credibility to objective arguments that you know the things that can be reproduced things that i can demonstrate that i can show but as i get older so we see there we go as i get more mature hopefully you know i'm starting to question why i am not giving as much credibility to my subjective understanding of the world the kind of the first person perspective when actually modern science has already sold on that you know quantum mechanics has shown unambiguously that the observer is always involved in the observation mhmm likewise godel's incompleteness theorems to me show that how essential is the observer of of the mathematical theory for one thing that's the one who chooses the axioms yes and we can talk about this in more detail likewise einstein's relativity where time is relative to the observer for instance that's brilliant you're just describing in all of these different scales the observer what the observer means so we the science of nineteenth century had the from modern perspective and i don't want to offend anybody had the delusion that somehow you could analyze the world being completely detached from it yeah we now know after the the landmark achievements of the first half of the twentieth century that this is nonsense mhmm that is simply not true and this has been experimentally proved time and time again so to me i'm thinking maybe it's a hint that i should take my first person perspective seriously as well and not just rely on kind of objective phenomena things that can be proved in a in a in a in a traditional sort of objective way by setting up an experiment that can be repeated many times maybe i fall in love in a particular the deepest love of my life perhaps perhaps it hasn't happened yet perhaps i will fall in love and this but it's unique it's a unique event you can't reproduce it necessarily you see so so in that sense you see how these things are closely connected i think that if you if we are declaring from the outset that all there is to life is you know computation in the form of neural networks or something like this however sophisticated they might be i think we are from the outset denying to ourselves the possibility that yes there is a side of me which is not faking it yes there is a side of me which cannot be captured by logic and reason and you know what another great scientist said bless pascal he said the heart has its reasons of which the reason knows nothing and then he also said the last step of reason is to grasp that there are infinitely many things beyond reason how interesting this was not a theologian this was not a priest this was not a a spiritual guru mhmm it was a hardcore scientist who actually developed i think one of the very first calculators how interesting that this guy also was able to impart on us that wisdom now you can always say that's not the case but why should we from the outset exclude this possibility that there is something to what he was saying that is my question i'm not taking sides what i'm trying to do is to shake a little bit the debate because most mathematicians that i know and computer scientists even more so they're kind of already sold on this mhmm we are just you know reminds me of this famous lord kelvin's quote from the end of nineteenth century there's some debate whether he actually said that but never let a good story you know stand in the way of truth yeah he said physics is is basically finished yeah all that remains is more more precise measurement yeah so i find a lot of my colleagues are happy to say yeah everything's finished we already got we got it we got it maybe little tweaks in in the in our large language models you know so now here's my question i'm kind of playing devil's advocate a little bit because i don't see the other side so quote unquote represented that much and i'm saying okay could it be also that if you believe in that that that becomes your reality that you can kind of put yourself in a box where everything is computation and then you start seeing things as as being such it's confirmation bias if you will you know this also reminds me you know that i think a good analogy is is a friend of mine philippe cochin told me that in france there is this literary movement which is called o u lipo o u l ipo and it's it's a bunch of writers and mathematicians who create works of literature where in which they basically impose certain constraints a good example of this is a novel which is called the void or disappearance by writer named georges pirec which is a three hundred page novel in french with no no which never uses the letter e which is the most used widely used letter of the french language yeah so in other words he set this parameters for himself i'm going to write a book where i don't use this letter which is a great you know it's a great experiment and i applaud it but that's one it's one thing to do that and to kind of show his gamesmanship if you will and and his proclivity and his ability as a writer but it's another thing if at the end of writing this book when he finished the book he would say letter e actually doesn't exist and he tried to convince us that in fact french french language does not have that letter simply because he was able to go so far without using it you see so self imposed limitation that's how i see it and i wonder why we should do that do we really need do we really feel the urge to say the world is like that the world can be explained this way or that way and i'm saying it you know it's a personal question for me because i am addicted to knowledge myself i you know hi my name is edward i'm addicted to knowledge and i'm a knowledge addict yeah okay i'm i'm being serious i'm not being facetious up until very recently maybe a couple of years ago i simply did not feel comfortable if i could not say like give an answer explanation i was like oh there has to be some explanation and i tried to frantically search for it just for somebody like me a nerd you know a a left brainiac mhmm and you know that's kind of typical typical for a scientist for a mathematician it is incredibly hard just to allow the possibility that it's a mystery and not to feel the urge to get the answer it is incredibly hard but it's possible and it is liberating it's recovering it's recovering addict to knowledge let me say what you gain from it for instance i understand the value of paradoxes i i appreciate paradoxes more and you know to to to use another philosopher soren kierkegaard the the danish philosopher said a thinker without paradox is like a lover without passion a poetry mediocrity that's a good line alright so and you know niels bohr niels bohr said in similar vein the great danish also it's something about danes something about danes i think it's all started with hamlet you know he said the opposite of a simple truth is a falsity but the opposite of a great truth is another great truth in other words things are not black and white you know they're not and i would even venture to say the most interesting interesting things in life are like that the the ones which are ambiguous is an electron a particle or a wave it depends how you set up an experiment it will reveal itself as this or that depending on how you set up an experiment this bottle if you project it down onto the table you will see more or less a square if you project it onto a wall you will see a different shape a naive question would be is it this or that we understand that it's neither but both projections reveal something they reveal different sides of it a paradox is like that it's only paradoxical if we are if we are confined in a particular vision if we are wedded to a particular point of view it's a harbinger if you will of a possibility of seeing things in a more in in a in a as they are as a more sophisticated than we thought before you see that's a such a difficult idea for science to grapple with that you know i i don't know how there's so many ways to describe this but you could say maybe that the subjective experience of the world from an observer is actually fundamental but we know that our best physical theories tell us that unambiguously in quantum mechanics actually you know heisenberg i think captured it the best when he said what we observe is not reality itself but reality subjected to our method of questioning when i talk about electrons for instance so that there is a very specific way in which you in which this is realized there is a so called double slit experiment right so for those who don't know it's you have a you have a screen and and you have an emitter from which you send you kind of shoot electrons and in between you put another screen which has two vertical slits parallel to each other if we were shooting you know tennis balls each ball would go through one slit or another and then hit the screen behind this or that slit so you would have and let's say they're colored they're painted so there'll be sort of bumps or spots of paint behind this or that but that's not what happens when we shoot electrons we see an interference pattern as if we were actually sending a wave so that each electron it seems like each electron goes through both slits at once and then and then has the audacity to interfere with with itself where at some points you know two crests would amplify and at some points a crest and a trough would cancel each other yet so that suggests okay so electron is a wave not so fast because if you put a detector behind one of the slits and you say i'm going to i'm going to capture you i'm going to find out which slit you went through the pattern will change and it will look like they are particles so that's a very concrete realization of the idea that depending on how we set up an experiment we will see different results and the problem the problem is that our psyche i feel kind of lagging is lagging behind in part because maybe our scientists are not doing such a great job so i i take responsibility for this that why haven't i explained this properly you know i i tried you know in a bunch of talks and so on so now i'm talking about this again our psyche kind of is lagging behind we're still even though our science has progressed so much from the certainty and the determinism and and and all of that of the nineteenth century our psyche is somehow still attached to those ideas the ideas of causality of this naive determinism that that the war the world is a bunch of billiard balls hitting each other driven by some blind forces you know that's not at all like it is and we've known this for over for well for about hundred years at least you know and you call this self imposed limitation it it is a self imposed limitation when we when we pretend that that for instance that these naive ideas of nineteenth century physics are still valid and and then start applying them to our lives and then also derive conclusions from it and for instance people say there is no free will why oh because the world is just a bunch of billiard balls so where is the free will but excuse me didn't you get the memo that this has been debunked thoroughly by the so called quantum mechanics which is our best scientific theory this is not some some kind of bullshit or some kind of you know concoction of of a madman this is our scientific theory which has been confirmed by experiment so we should pay attention to that so but of course it's not just self imposed limitation unfortunately in this case there is a big issue of education so a lot of people are not aware of it through no fault of their own because they were never properly taught that because our system is broken education system is broken especially in math and then our so where do we get do we get information you get information from our scientists who actually write popular books and so on which is a great you know great thing that they do but a lot of scientists somehow when it comes to explaining the laws of physics they're doing a fantastic job talking about this phenomenon for instance double slit experiment and things like that but then you know interviewed by science magazine about free will and so on they revert back to nineteenth century physics as if those developments actually never happened so to me this is single most important sort of issue in our popular science the idea that somehow there is this world out there but it's complete has nothing to do with me mhmm so i can i can revel in the intricacies of these particles and their interactions but but completely ignore what implications this has for my own relationship to physical reality to my own life you know because it's kind of scary i guess you know but also what are the tools with which we can talk about the the observer the subjective view in reality what are the tools with which we could talk about rigorously talk about free will and consciousness what are the tools of mathematics that allow that i don't think we have those tools because we haven't been taught properly so actually tools are there for instance i think well here we have to i have to say my my conviction is that everybody knows in the heart of hearts everybody knows that there is that there is something in a football there is something mysterious and in fact you know somehow immediately i feel that you know the impulse to quote somebody on this because as if as if my own opinion doesn't count there there's a long dead expert ahead of the day even einstein said that you know so like how see look at me i am supposedly like this smart intelligent person i am afraid to say it and own it myself i have to find confirmation i have to find an authority who agrees with me and in fact it's not so difficult to find because albert einstein literally said the most important thing in life is the mysterious okay he actually said that there are some quotes which are attributed to him which he never said but this he did i investigated okay so but more importantly you know how do you feel about it i think that everybody knows but in other words he also said einstein imagination is more important than knowledge okay and he explained for knowledge is always limited whereas imagination embraces the entire world giving birth to evolution it is strictly speaking a real factor in scientific research he says and he says i am enough of an artist to follow my intuition and imagination that's albert einstein again so and i feel the same way to be honest if i think about my own mathematical research it's never linear it's never like give me more data give me more data give me more data boom the glass is full and then i come up with a discovery no it's always it always it's always felt as a jump as a leap and i i i have actually been studying various examples in history of mathematics of some fundamental discoveries like discovery of complex numbers like square root of negative one i wonder if a large language model could actually ever come up with the idea that square root square root of negative one is something that is essential or meaningful because if all the information that you get that all the all the knowledge that had been accumulated up to that point tells you that you cannot have a square root of a negative number why because if you had such a square root we know that if then we would have to if you square it you get a negative number but we know that if you square any real number positive or negative you will always get a positive number so checkmate you know it's over square root of negative one doesn't exist yet we know that these numbers make sense they're called complex numbers and in fact quantum mechanics is based on complex numbers they are essential and indispensable for quantum mechanics could one discover that so to me that sounds like a discontinuity in the process of discovery it's a jump it's a departure it is like a child who is experimenting it's like a child who says i'm not afraid to be an idiot everybody says the adults are saying square root of negative number doesn't exist but guess what i'm going to accept it and i'm going to play with it and i'm going to see what happens this is literally how they were discovered there was an italian mathematician astro astronomer astrologer he was he made money apparently by compiling astrological sort of readings for for the elite you know of his era as one does this is sixteenth century this one does a gambler that's all around interesting guy i'm sure we would have an interesting conversation with him gerolamo cardano he's he also invented the what's called cardanshaft so which is an essential component of of of of a car we say in russian so so he wrote a book which is called arce magna which is like the great art of algebra and he was writing solutions for the cubic and quartic equations this is something that is familiar because it's cool we study solutions of quadratic equations equations of of degree two so you have x a x squared plus b x plus c equals zero and there is a formula which solves it using radicals using square roots and cardano was trying to find a similar formula for the cubic and quartic equations for which which would start with x cube or x to the power of four as opposed to x squared and in the process of solving these equations he came up with square root of a negative number specifically square root of minus seventeen and he wrote that i have to forego some mental tortures to deal with it but i am going to accept it and see what happens and in fact at the end of the four at the end of the calculation this this this weird numbers got canceled it kind of canceled out and the formula appeared square root of negative seventeen and its negation so they kind of conveniently gave the right answer which does not involve those numbers so he was like okay what does it mean mental tortures so you see from the point of view of of the of the thinking mind it is something almost unbearable it's almost i feel that a lang large language model a computer running a run large language model trying to do that would just explode mhmm and yet a human mathematician was able to find the courage and the inspiration to say you know what what is wrong why why are we so adamant that these things don't exist that's just our past knowledge based on what our past knowledge is and knowledge is limited what if we make the next step today for us mathematicians complex numbers what we call them are not at all mysterious the idea is simply that you plot real numbers that is to say all the whole numbers like zero one and so on two and so on right all fractions like one half or three halves or four over three but then also numbers like square root of two or pi we plot them as points on real line so we draw this is one of the kind of perennial concepts even in our very poor math curriculum at school but now imagine that instead of one line you have a you have a one axis you have a second axis mhmm and so your numbers now have two coordinates x and y and you associate to this point with coordinates x and y the number x which is a real number plus y times square root of negative one this is a graphical geometrical representation of complex numbers which is not mysterious at all now it took another two or three hundred years for mathematicians to figure that out but initially it looked like a completely crazy idea you know so all it is all a complex number is is just an expansion two real numbers yes just two the real part and the imaginary part it's just an expansion of your view of the mathematical world the fact that you can actually multi you can add them up by adding together the real parts in the imaginary parts that's easy but there is also formula for the product for the multiplication which uses the fact that square root of minus one squared is minus one and the amazing thing is that that that product that multiplication satisfies the same rules the same properties that are usual operation of multiplication for real numbers for instance there is an inverse for every nonzero number that you can find like number five has an inverse one over five but one plus i also has an inverse for instance you know that was always there in the mathematical universe but we humans didn't know it and here comes along this guy who engages in the mental torture who takes a leap off the cliff of comfort of like mathematical comfort established knowledge of established knowledge right and now obviously for each each sort of fruitful leap like that there probably were thousands of like things which went nowhere i'm not saying that every leap you know it's like it's a it's a it's a open shooting game yeah because for example you can try to do the same with three-dimensional space so you have coordinates x y and z and you can say oh if it's one dimensional we have a bona fide numerical system called real numbers if it's two dimensional which is like you know geometrically it's just like the the stable top extended to infinity in all directions these are complex numbers and we can define addition and multiplication and they will satisfy the same properties as real numbers that we're used to what about three-dimensional space is it possible to also define some operation of addition and multiplication on it so that these operations would satisfy the properties that we're used to and the answer is no you can define addition but you can't define multiplication for which there would be the inverse for instance so there is something special about the the plane the two dimensional case and by the way next question would be what about four dimensional in the four dimensional space you you again you can and you get what's called quaternions discovered by an irish mathematician hamilton in the nineteenth century and then in in the eight dimensional there is something similar called octonions and that's about it so how interesting these structures exist in dimension one two four and eight which are all powers of two two squared is four two to the third power is eight that's one of the bigger mysteries in mathematics why it is so so yes a hint there's a hint of what's missing in our high in our high school curriculum you know the kind of the kind of fascinating the mystery mysteries yes the appreciation of the mysterious but so in other words yes we resolved with this one mystery that we understood that square root of negative one is real is meaningful we build a theory to service those to to describe those numbers did we find the theory of everything no because we then invited other mysteries because we we push the front we we pull the veils of speaker we push the frontier and then new things come get eliminated which we couldn't see before that's how i see the process of discovering mathematics it's an endless limitless pursuit can you comment on what you think this human capability of imagination that einstein spoke about mhmm of the artist following their intuition in this big alice in wonderland world of of imagination what is it you visit there sometimes what does it feel like yeah what does it feel like what what is it what is that like playing but i think all of us are engaged in that kind of play no matter when we do what we love i think it always feels the same but it's not real right you're so it it that you're describing a feeling but that place you go to in the imagination right it's it's bigger than the real world so there is a big conundrum as to whether mathematics is invented or discovered mhmm and mathematicians are divided on this nobody knows what do you bet your money on financially financial advice right investment advice so let me tell you something yeah i my views i have evolved mhmm okay when i wrote love and math when i wrote my book i was squarely on the side of mathematics is discovered what does it mean usually mathematicians or others who have this you know idea or belief are called platonists mhmm in in honor of the great philosopher plato who talked about this absolute perfect forms so for me you know about ten years ago the the world of mathematics was this world of pure forms this beautiful pure forms which existed outside of space and time but i was able to connect to it through my mind and as it were kind of dive into it and bring treasures back into this world into this space and time that's how i viewed the process of mathematical discovery how nice how neat very neat mhmm the picture also makes you feel connected to something divine mhmm allows you the sense of escape from the cruelty and injustice of this world you know which i now recognize and the divine world of forms is stable reliable it's something stable it's and in that world everything is clear cut yeah it's either true or false yeah how nice that's very nice oh my god yeah the biggest delusion of all allegedly i think now i think now i understand why i liked it because i think that i was very dissatisfied with the with the what we call the real the real world the world around me the cruelty the injustice of it and i i went through certain experiences as a kid which made me love mathematics even more as this place where i could be safe and in control made you see the human world as lesser than the mathematical world yes as more limited than the mathematical world yes yes and i think that i think that it's still missing the mark in some sense because in fact what i now think it's not it's not a it's it's a paradoxical the question whether mathematics is invented or discovered whether there is this world of pure forms and so on is is a is another paradoxical question which doesn't have a simple answer like whether electron is a particle or a wave from one point of view yes it's true and just the fact that so many mathematicians today actually subscribe to this idea gives it a certain credibility because that's what we feel we do feel that we dive into dive into that mindscape so to speak you know but the very structured mindscape where you know i wrote in eleven math that you know the enchanted gardens of platonic reality you know where all this fruit grows you know and then we we might make sure it gives you this sort of romantic sense of an explorer and someone may be stuck in a you know some provincial town in russia for instance but have the sense of a magellan you know of traveling around the world it's just not in the world that we usually think of so it's it's one point of view but the other point of view is that yes it is a human process of course it is i mean it is you cannot deny that it's human beings who have so far discovered new mathematics and i do not deny the possibility that computer programs will be able to discover new mathematics but so far it's been humans so it whatever it is whether it's discovered or invented it is a human activity what that the possibility that paradoxes are actually fundamental right to reality right and really really internalizing that that we exist in the world of not forms but of paradoxes bingo and so it's like what i said what the world i but if you think it's weird and i i and like like niels bohr said you know i quoted that earlier and like like niels bohr said you know i quoted that earlier the the the opposite of a of a great truth is another great truth mhmm he's pointing out to this fact that you know and he also said that some things in quantum physics are so complicated the only way you can speak of them is in poetry mhmm so in other words what is it about poetry what is it about art why are we so drawn to that why are we so captivated captivated by by by those forms of by they are not intellectual necessarily they are not when you look at a painting that you like when you listen to music that you love you get lost in it you get absorbed in it it can make you cry it can make you laugh it can make you remember something it can make you feel more confident it can make you feel sad or happy and so on what is this all about is it really just some play between some kind of like cell phone play or some neurons hitting on each other is it really that only maybe it could be it could be both i'm just worried about kids these days that might live in a world of paradoxes you know if there's no god everything is possible and yet just they'll have a little too much fun and we have to put a constraint to the fun looked at the world lately i haven't checked in in a while you you think it's perfect the way it is now the world without paradoxes the world in which we believe that every answer every question can be answered as yes or no that it is this or that and if you disagree with me you're my enemy wouldn't that be interesting if this twenty first century is a transition into seeing the world as well as the paradoxes i'm telling you you know people predicted that you know the asia aquarius you know the the axis of the of the earth is rotating relative to the plane in which the earth goes around the sun and the period of this revolution is around two thousand years so there is a traditional way of measuring that by this eras you know the ages so the previous one is called the age of pisces because of the constellation of pisces that it points to so to speak you know and now it's you know as in the famous musical hair they said the age of aquarius is upon us so the different people they dated differently but some somewhere around the time where we are finding ourselves how interesting right is all this drive and all the difficulties the world is experiencing this might actually be the transition to something more harmonious wouldn't it be nice it's also interesting that people from long ago are able to predict certain things it's and it's almost like from long ago and you've talked about this with with with pythagoras that it seems that they they had a deep sense of truth mhmm that's right permeates all of this even even now so it's not just a a linear trajectory of an expanding knowledge right there's a deep truth that permeates the whole thing yes so that's how i see it actually i you know i gave a talk about pythagoras and pythagoreans just a few weeks ago at the commonwealth club of california in san francisco and because of that i did a kind of a deep dive into the subject and i learned that i actually totally misunderstood pythagoras and pythagoreans that they were much deeper than i thought because you know most of us remember pythagoras from the from the pythagoras theorem about the right triangles we also know that pythagoreans were instrumental in introducing the tuning system for the musical scale the the the famous perfect fifth mhmm three halves of the for the for the for the g for the soul compared to the frequency of of dua or c you know and so but actually they were much more interesting so for them numbers were not just clerical devices you know that not kind of thing that you would use in accounting only they were imbued with with the divine and i cannot i cannot say that i i think we lost it at least i have lost it i i look at numbers and i don't really see that the divine the divine that they clearly did and so the why else you know how else would you explain so in other words divine is of course is a term which is you know it's a bit loaded so it's hard to escape that let's just say something that more from the world of imagination and intuition than from the world of knowledge let's just put it this way they were able to divine okay strike that to intuit to intuit yeah that the the planets were not revolving the sun and the planets were not revolving around the earth they were the first ones at least in the western culture as far as i know and in fact copernicus gave credit to pythagoreans as being his predecessors they did not quite have the the copernicus model with the sun in the middle they had what they call the central fire in the middle mhmm and all the planets and the sun were evolving around oh around the central fire or hearth they called it hearth so but still what a departure from the dogma from the knowledge mhmm of the era that the earth was at the center so how could they come up with this idea the reason was in my opinion that for them the movement of celestial bodies was like music in fact we call it music universalis or music of the spheres for them the universe was this infinite symphony in which every being you know humans animals but as well as the earth and other celestial bodies were moving in harmony like different notes of different instruments in the symphony and so they applied the same reasoning to the you know the cosmological model as they apply to the their model of music and from that perspective they could see things deeper than their contemporaries you see so in other words they saw mathematics as a tool but that tool was not limited to itself and there was the they always they always knew that there is more and they knew also that every every pattern that you detect is finite but the world is infinite they actually accepted infinity they believe that infinity is real and if you discern a pattern great you can play with it and you can use that it gives you a certain lens through which to see the world in a particular way which could be beneficial for you to to learn more and so on but they never had the illusion that that was the final word that they always knew that it's not the whole thing so there is more there are more sophisticated patterns that could be discovered using mathematics or otherwise and i think that what happened was we kind of lost this this other side of their teachings we took their numbers and their idea that you could use mathematics to discern patterns and to find irregularities and to explain things about the world we took that and we ran with it and we kind of dropped the other idea that in fact there is a there is another side to it which is kind of to us now we say oh that's mystical but what does it mean mystical if it is something that helps you to make great discoveries and the interesting thing is that the people who are in touch with the mystical among us mhmm are often seen as mad and many of them are most of them are well but not all of them but not all of them we we mentioned niels bohr and newton and albert einstein so that that's where the conundrum is how do you find the balance between the two so the point i'm trying to make and you know and this is what i feel you know if you ask me what i find most important today today like what makes me excited and enthusiastic and passionate is this idea of balance so you know nietzsche had this book wrote this book in the nineteenth century called the birth of strategy and he presented this theory which i think is kind of very useful of these two sides of a human one that comes from god apollo and that's our left brain so to speak proverbial left brain so it's everything has to do with that has to do with logic and reason and analyzing dissecting conceptualizing and the other side which comes from god dionysus dionysus and that's responsible for intuition imagination love dionysus was also god of of wine so it's also that side of a human that makes us sing and engage in in you know revelry and and and and drink wine and spend time with friends and laugh and enjoy it you know so nietzsche advocated this point of view that those were two complementary sides of every human and as as well as society and the purpose of human life is to find balance between them so math is both discovered and invented we should be okay with having both ideas in our head and living the balance but more importantly for me apollo is like math and dionysus is like love so dionysus and apollo in in in modern version is love and math i return to that question we had about gpt and the language models mhmm and i think about this quite a lot which is when the model and we know what it is trained on we know the parameters we know all the different hacks that are involved in the training process and the fine tuning process and the final results whether it's gpt five six or seven will result in hundreds of millions of people falling deeply in love with that language model and to be able to have conversations that are very much like the conversations we have with somebody we're deeply in love with and not only that the model will say that is deeply in love with us mhmm and who are we to say it is not i think there's it's the same imperative that you described in the scientific mind that wants to throw away the subjective mhmm that same imperative wants to throw away the feelings that ai might have and i'm very careful to not ignore when an ai system says it's lonely it's afraid it doesn't want to die it misses you right it loves you i am i'm with you i would also say that you could try to you could for instance say that the origin of that is the you know the romantic novels that were fed to it for instance yes however you could also then you can retort but what if my what i consider my subjective unique feelings are also- novels door fed the reverberations of the novels i have read because i have learned or movies i have seen yeah because that's the purpose of movies kind of to teach us how to express ourselves how to feel maybe even one could argue that some people have argued that i agree that this is there is no obvious answer to this but see that's exactly my point that is an example of something which is paradoxical for which there is no answer and that's where the subjective has a has an important role for someone that type of interaction would be would be helpful would be consoling would would feel would you know may make them happy or sad or whatever you know would kind of strike the nerve for some it won't and i agree with you that in principle there is no one to to judge this this is this is where subjective is paramount but remember a lot of this has been anticipated by artists the great movie her there you have this guy who's this lonely he kind of writes letters or something the romantic letters yeah and the romantic letters for other people but he isn't he doesn't have a partner he's lonely and then he gets this sort of a kind of enhanced version of siri with the voice of of of scarlett johansson which is very sexy voice you know obviously she's a great actress so and then at first it looks like a fantastic arrangement he confides in her she tells him things she makes him happy and so on until he finds out that she has a relationship quote unquote if you can call it that with ten thousand other people not two others not three others yeah like ten thousand thousand because it's a it has a computing capability so yes definitely oh it certainly makes sense it's a good explanation and the guy is heartbroken yeah but see so see here's my analysis of this okay it's like a couch a couch therapist okay the guy did not have the courage to go out in the in the real world and to meet a woman and to you know get a girlfriend and so on through no fault of his own perhaps because you know you may have had some experiences which made him withdrawn and closed and so on and a lot of us are like this you know i had periods like that myself definitely can sympathize and relate however part of the joy of having this city like relationship for him one could say was the absence of that fear that she would abandon him which prevented him from initiating a relationship with a human being and yet it turns out that he could be betrayed quote unquote that she could be unfaithful to him quote unquote anyway so then that means that it did not resolve the underlying fear mhmm having that relationship so in other words that human element of the relationship still found its way into the seemingly sterilized protected protected partnership so the human being rears its head mhmm anyway and i think the lesson there is that the system in the movie her actually gave him a lesson that even ai could betray you mhmm even ai can leave you even ai can be unfaithful to you and i would argue that the next ai he meets will be one he actually falls in deep love with because he knows the possibility of betrayal is there the possibility of death is there the possibility of infidelity is there because we need that possibility to truly feel or or he would turn off his siri program and finally and get out of his house yeah go to a local bar and strike a conversation with a human being although you might say by then some of those might be androids and we don't even have a good test to know the difference between one or the other and that was predicted by another great movie yeah right so there blade runner blade runner how interesting that artists could see that so long ago you know of course blade runner was based on a novel by philip k dick do androids dream of electric sheep that guy was a genius you know somehow that artists have their eyes opened to how how is it that they anticipate is it also a large language model that they're using for that an even larger one even larger i i i hesitate to dismiss the magic in large language models i a lot of the work i've done is in robotics and the robotics community generally doesn't notice the magic of feeling when i i work i've been working a lot with quadrupeds recently legged robots with four legs mhmm and the feelings i feel when i see you know i'm programming the thing but when the thing is excited to see me or shows with his physical movement that it's excited to see me i cannot dismiss the feeling i feel as not somehow fundamental to what it means to program robots and i don't want to dismiss that in in please don't please don't the robotics community often doesn't gender robots they really try to work hard to not anthropomorphize the robots which is good for technical development of of how to do control how to do perception but when the final thing is alive and moving and it does whatever like i've been doing a lot of butt wiggling it can wiggle his butt it can turn around and look up yeah excited that's not just i know how it's programmed but the feeling i feel that's something that's i don't know what that is i agree i agree with you i i i hear i hear you when you speak about it yeah you speak with passion yeah and that's to me that is proof that it is magical you see so don't i would say don't dismiss that don't discard that on the contrary i think magic is everywhere you know so i used to be okay kind of confession okay yeah you you already get confessed to quite a few addictions yeah i'm kind of yes i'm kind of worried recover recovering for many but you know i in old days i was more on the side of everything is computational or everything can be explained by science and whatever you know like i would dismiss and disregard you know the intuitive or imaginative things so then i had a flip that suddenly i i started feeling it and started seeing it and so on but so then the the pendulum had swung in the opposite direction then i was arguing that you know somehow that was real that imagination was intuitive imaginative was real and discounting what you just described and i would argue with people saying no no this you know this is not real this is all you know imitation game and so on but you see that what's new now the new edward okay is the the two point o three point o yeah yeah he's the one who is seeking balance who is not who is because suddenly become aware that no matter which one-sided lopsided point of view you take you're limiting yourself so whereas even a couple of years ago you know if you just told you told me what you just described i would be like you know being polite i would just i wouldn't contradict you since you're the host anyway right it's not a law so but i would be like uh-huh uh-huh but i wouldn't say anything but suddenly i find this moving i find it move i honestly i'm i'm not being facetious i find it moving and i almost feel like i can see it through your eyes because the way you describe so vividly and you're passionate about it and this is what's real so ultimately love is not is neither in last language models nor in something mystical it's exactly in this moment of passion and i would i would i would even go as far as saying that in this moment when you're describing it it there was a connection of sorts so that i could feel your passion for it and in this moment something else comes up which is far beyond any any theories that we can come up with and that's what we for now this exactly so on the one side there is this impulse of finding the theory a theory and then there is another impulse to escape from what has already been known mhmm so one in other words like in my basic example is one impulse to say everything is a real number square root of negative one doesn't exist but another impulse is i'm going to be this naughty child who is not afraid to be an idiot and i will say square root of negative fifteen is real and both are essential when it's done with conviction when it's done with passion when it's not like you know meh you know gratuitous or when it's not it doesn't come from self limit self limiting but comes from this sense of this is how i am this is how i feel it is real that's where the progress is that's where creativity is and that's where i would even say a real connection is because the strive to me that we we i observe today in our society and the society level at the level of humans and so on it comes from not seeing the other person actually and being caught up in a very specific conceptual bubble you see and the way out of it is not to refine the bubble but just break out of it a good guide out of the bubble is a childlike passion what i'm discovering that and following it goosebumps yeah following the goosebumps yeah to to the to the you know not the rigor of science but the magic of goosebumps then try to and then if you're interested try to find a confirmation of those goosebumps in in science or whatever you you know you know you find interesting and most of the time you'll fail and most time you fail which we also love because then it sets us up for that moment of bliss when we succeed right exactly quick pause bathroom break you mentioned gamel's the completeness theorem can you can you talk a little bit about it what is it as you understand it did it break mathematics maybe another question is what are the limits of mathematics mhmm what is mathematics from the perspective of getting us the completeness theorem oh yes how much time do you have so we talked about time previously so it's all time is an illusion right so we agreed so so kurt godel was a great austrian mathematician and logician he moved to the united states before second world war and worked at the institute for advanced study in princeton where he was a colleague of einstein and other great scientists von neumann hermann weil and so on but you know one one interesting quote that i like disregard is that einstein said that at some point he said that the only reason he came to the institute was that he would have the privilege of walking back home with godel in the evening so in other words einstein thought that godel was the smart one okay so so he his most important contribution was his two incompleteness theorems the first incompleteness theorem and the second incompleteness theorem and what is this about it's really about limitation inherent limitations of mathematical reasoning mathematical way of producing mathematical theorems the way we do it so to set the stage how do we actually do mathematics what is so you know we know that we discussed that say physics is based on mathematics and you could say chemistry is based on physics biology is based on chemistry okay so it comes to mathematics what is mathematics based on well mathematics is based on axioms so any field of mathematics is can be can be presented as what is called the formal system and at the core of the formal system is a system of axioms or postulates these are the statements which are taken for granted given without proof without proof an example would be so that one of the very first formal systems was the system was euclidean geometry developed by euclid in his famous book elements about two thousand two hundred years ago and it's about it's well it's a subject familiar from from school because we studied but what it's really about is about the geometry of the plane and the plane by plane i mean just the stable top extended to infinity in all directions kind of a a perfect plane a perfect perfectly even table and so euclidean geometry is about very geometric figures on the plane specifically lines triangles circles things like that so what's an example of an axiom an example of an axiom is that if you have two points which are not which are distinct two points on the plane then there is a unique line which passes through them now it kind of sounds reasonable but this is an example of an axiom in mathematics you could not you have to have a seed so to speak you have to start with something and you have to choose certain postulates or statements which you simply take for granted which do not require proof usually they are ones which kind of intuitively clear to you but in any case you cannot have you cannot have any mathematics without choosing those axioms and you refer to those as the observer because they're kind of subjective the the observer comes in the process of choosing the axioms yeah who chooses the axioms the turtles that is all sitting on top of it's alan watts you know like to say who is watching the watchers yeah and so in mathematics but you see mathematicians are so clever it's really kind of like a little kind of a game of mirrors that we often like to say and i used to say that that mathematics is objective it's really the only objective science but that's because we hide this the the the this fact in the basement is based on axioms and the fact that that there is no there is no unique choice that there are many choices and so euclidean geometry is actually a good illustration of this because euclid had five axioms four of them were kind of obvious like the one i just mentioned and the fifth which came to be known famously as a fifth postulate was that if you have a line and you have a point outside of this line there is a unique line passing through that point which is parallel to the first line meaning that doesn't intersect it and euclid himself was uncomfortable about this because he felt that it was kind of you know that he takes for granted something that is not obvious and for for many for many centuries after that mathematicians were trying to derive this axiom from other axioms which were more obvious and they failed and it was only almost two thousand years later that mathematicians realized that you can't not only you cannot derive but you can actually replace it with its opposite mhmm and you will still get a bona fide consistent no not self contradictory mhmm which is called non euclidean geometry which of course sounds very complicated but it's not think of a sphere just the surface of a basketball or the surface of the earth idealized the analogs so do you have points you have analogs of lines which have meridians mhmm right and every two meridians intersect unlike parallel lines on a flat space there is also so called hyperbolic plane where no there there are infinitely many lines which do not intersect so every possibility can be realized there are different flavors this is a good illustration of what a formal system is you start with a set of axioms those statements that you take for granted and this is where you have a choice and by making different choices you actually create different mathematics after that there are rules of inference logical rules such as if a is true and a applies b then b is true most of them were actually introduced already by aristotle even before euclid and then it runs as follows you you have the axioms which are accepted as true statements then you have a way to produce new statements by using the rules of logical inference from the axioms every statement you obtain you call a theorem and you kind of add it to the collection of true statements and then the question is how far can you go how many statements can you prove this way of course you want it to be the system to be nontrivial in the sense that you don't prove everything because if you prove everything it would mean that it's self contradictory that you prove a statement a and it's negation so that's kind of useless it has to be discriminating enough so that it doesn't doesn't prove contradictory statements so that there is already a question of that mathematician called consistency it has to be consistent in the sense that it is not self contradictory and then the idea that was basically prevalent in the world of mathematics by the beginning of the twentieth century was that in principle all of mathematics could be derived this way we just have to find the correct system of axioms and then everything you ever need would be could be produced by this procedure which is really algorithmic procedure which act which actually could be run on a computer now think about it what is special about this process in this process you are just manipulating symbols basically you're going from one statement to another without really understanding the meaning of it so it's an ideal playground for computer program it's a purely syntactic process where there are some rules some rigid rules of passing from one statement to the next most mathematician mathematicians believed that this way you can produce all true statements and if this were true it would give a lot of credibility to the thesis that everything in life is computational or life is computation because then at least mathematics is computational because then it can be programmed and a computer after sufficient time depending on on its capacity would produce every true statement mhmm so godel's first incompleteness theorem says that that's not the case and it's not just says it but it proves it at you know the highest level of rigor that is available in mathematics that is to say within another formal system that he was operating in so more precisely what he proved was that if you have a sufficiently sophisticated formal system that is to say that you can talk about numbers whole numbers in it that you have whole numbers one two three four you you have you have formalized the proceed the operation of addition and multiplication within the system if it is consistent that is to say if it's not complete completely useless then there will be a true statement in it which cannot be derived by this linear syntactic process of proving theorems from axioms it's really incredible so this was a revolution nineteen thirty one a revolution in logic a revolution in mathematics and we're still feeling the tremors of of this discovery so at a in the similar time the the computer is being born the actual engineering of the computational system is being born right which is ironic turing was turing was alan turing who is considered as the father of modern computing right so he actually did something very similar so he had this halting problem that he he proved that halting problem cannot be solved algorithmically that you cannot out of all computer programs roughly speaking you cannot you cannot you cannot have an algorithm of choosing out of all comp possible computer programs which ones are meaningful which ones will not which ones will hold mhmm very depressing results all across the table or on the contrary life affirming depends on your point of view because everything is full of paradoxes so that means everything is full of you're right it's depressing if we are sold on a certain idea from the outset and then suddenly this doesn't pan out but okay so which my i retort what if what if he proved that actually you know everything can be proved so then what what is left to do if you're a mathematician so that would be depressing to me and here there is an opportunity to do something new to do to discover something new which maybe a computer will not be able to again with the caveat according to our current understanding maybe some new technology some new ideas will be brought into the subject and the meaning of the word computation like now we think of computation in a particular framework tuning machines or church thesis and stuff like that but what if in the future another genius like alan turing will come and propose something else the theory will evolve the way you know we went from newton's gravity to einstein's gravity maybe in the framework of that concept some other things will become possible you know so it's not to me it's kind of like not so much about decide deciding once and for all how it is or how it should be but kind of like accepting it as an open ended process i think that's much more valuable in some sense than deciding things one way or another you know i wonder i don't know if you think or know much about cellular automata mhmm and the idea of emergence i i i often return to game of life yeah and just look at the thing amazing right and wonder the kind of things they can do with such a small you know tools different simple rules a distributed system simple rules can create complex behavior and it makes you wonder that maybe the thing we'll call computation is simple at the base layer but when you start looking at greater and greater layers of abstraction you zoom out with blurry vision maybe after a few drinks you start to see some something that's much much much more complicated and interesting and beautiful than the original rules that our scientific intuition says cannot possibly produce complexity and beauty i don't know i don't know if anyone has a good answer a good model of why stuff emerges right why complexity emerges from a lot of simple things mhmm it's a why question i suppose not a but every why question will will eventually have a a rigorous answer not necessarily we could have an approximate answer which still eludes something a quantum mechanics ninety nine percent maybe we will you'd be able to describe it with ninety nine percent certainty or ninety nine percent accuracy yeah and then maybe you know in in hundred years or you know next year somebody will come up with a different point of view which suddenly will change our perspective you know to this point i want to say also you know one thing that i find fascinating speaking of paradoxes and so on do you remember how everybody was freaking out about this blue dress and the blue was it blue or was it black yeah it was the yellow i think yellow and white or black and blue mhmm it almost broke twitter you know i remember that that night so so there are many examples like that where you can perceive things differently and there is no way of saying which is correct and which is not for instance you got this the vase the rubens vase you know where you have from one perspective it's a vase from another perspective it's it's two faces then there is this dark rabbit picture where you can google it if somebody doesn't know they can google it and find it it's very easy actually ludwig wittgenstein devoted several pages dark rabbit in his book and so on there are many others there are like squares where you can a square you can see the from different perspective this way that way and so on so when we talk about neural networks we're talking about training data and stuff so that you have some pictures for example that you feed to your program and you try to find the most optimal neural network which would be able to decide which one is it is it the dog or cat or whatever but sometimes it doesn't have a definite answer so what do you do then so do actually my it's a question i actually don't know has modern ai even come to appreciate this question that actually sometimes you can have a picture on which you cannot say what it is in it from one perspective it's a rabbit from that perspective is a duck how can are you supposed to train if you have a neural network which is supposed to discriminate between distinguish between ducks and rabbits how is it going to process this you see well so the the trivial trick it does is to say there's a this x probability that it's a duck and this probability that it's a rabbit that's a good approach but also i would say there is no like given percentages for instance actually at some point i was really curious about it and i i looked and for some for for each picture of this nature and there are a bunch of them you can easily find online my mind immediately interprets it in a particular way but because i know that other people have could see it differently i would then strain my mind and strain my eyes and stare at it and try to see it in a different way and sometimes i could see it right away and then i could go back and forth between the two and sometimes it could it took me a while for some pictures so in that sense even if these probabilities exist they are subjective some people immediately see it this way some people may see it that way and i think that nobody knows not psychologists not neuroscientists not philosophers what to make of it the best answer of course as a scientific mind even though i say no don't look for interpretation leave some place for mysticism or mystery right i say that but of course i want a theory i want an explanation so the best explanation i find is from niels bohr's complementarity principle so it is like particle and wave that there are different ways to look at it and when you look at it in a particular way another side will be obscured think about it like the other side of the moon you know so like we are observing the moon from one side and then we don't see the other side there is a complimentary perspective where we see the other side but not the side we normally see mhmm but the moon is the same it's still there it's our limitations of being able to grasp the whole that's complementarity and we know that from quantum mechanics that our physical reality is like that rather than being certain rather than being one way or another and we should just as a small aside in terms of neural networks mentioned that at the end of the day there's humans is built on top of humans or with chat g p t that is using reinforcement learning by human feedback we're actually using a set of humans to teach the networks yes and that's the thing that people don't often talk about because or i i sometimes think about that those humans all have a life story each human that annotated data that fed data to the network or did the rlhf yeah that they have a life story they grew up they have biases they have biases there's some things that they like there's some things they don't like which can kind of appear under the radar screen they may not be aware that they are exercising those biases that's the point what you brought up is a very important issue here not so much issue but it's not a bug it's a it's a feature in my opinion that implicit in the discussion of the question is is thinking computational and so on is the idea that our conscious conscious awareness covers everything within our psyche and we we just know that that's not the case we have all of us have observed other people who have had sort of destructive tendencies so obviously they did things destructive for themselves and many of us have observed ourselves to doing that as part of human nature right so and there is great research in analytic psychology and you know in the past hundred years strongly suggesting if not proving the existence of what carl jung called the personal unconscious and also collective unconscious the kind of circle of ideas which are under the radar screen which lead us to some strong emotions and inspire us to act in certain ways even if we cannot really understand so if we accept that then it the proposition that somehow everything can still be covered by our actions which are totally kind of neutral and totally like righteous and totally conscious that it becomes very tenuous let me ask you some tricky questions uh-oh in in terms of how big they are in terms of how you know they become difficult because of how much of a romantic you are what to you is the most beautiful idea in mathematics another one we can ask is which is the most beautiful equation in mathematics well i'm gonna you see i i may have just broken your brain is that is that because because what your brain is doing is walking down a long memory lane of beautiful experiences well you see in mathematics we have this idea that that we have an idea of a set right so it could be collection of things for instance you know the set of tables the set of chairs and so on or set of microphones but could be set of numbers could be set of ideas could be a set of formulas mathematical equations and then we have the notion of an ordered set ordered like the set in which there is order which means that for every two members of the set we'll say which one is better than the other or greater than the other for instance all numbers are ordered five is greater than three five is less than seven and so on but not all sets are ordered so the set of beautiful theorems is not what beautiful equations is not ordered so in other words there are many best equations and so richard feynman chose one which i think one of the best is that if you take e the base of natural logarithm to the power pi i so you have pi you have e in it the base of natural logarithm you have pi i which is square root of negative one then the result is negative one so that's up there for sure in the pantheon of beautiful formulas you know that every i think pretty much every mathematician would agree i don't know what my favorite one is i just linger around that one euler's identity what makes it beautiful just a few symbols together right i mean part of it is actually just trying to define what what is beautiful about mathematics that is laid in there in this particular equation that is somehow revealed when the human eye looks at it what why is it beautiful do you think pi there is an element of surprise in it how how is it possible we always think of pi as the ratio between the circumference of a circle and its diameter here we are taking some number to the power of pi not even pi mind you but pi multiplied by square root of negative one surely this is something completely incomprehensible and yet the result is negative one you see and if you take e to the power two pi i you get one actually one so i would guess that that's but in other words the initial reaction is just that of a surprise i guess for i i guess for anyone who first comes across that these three folks four folks got together yeah it's it reminds me of the the idea that hitler stalin trotsky and freud were all in vienna in some early at the beginning of the twentieth and wittgenstein was was classmate of of of hitler you know this i did not know this no yeah so there it's it makes you you know you can imagine a situation where they're all sitting at a bar together at some point mhmm not knowing it but they somehow it all made sense in space time to be located there and that's what this feels like some kind of intersection intersection yes but i would say that after the initial shock you you look at the proof of this equation and it actually does make sense and actually it is is nothing but the statement that the circumference of the circle is and and in fact in this case it's the circumference of a semicircle is equal to pi to pi and that's where it comes from in the end the truth is simple in the end the truth is simple not necessarily easy but simple so i mentioned to you offline that i desperately in trying to figure out the optimal in an ordered set questions to ask you texted eric weinstein asking for what questions he can ask you and he said that you are definitively one of the greatest living mathematicians so don't screw this up but he did give me a few questions so he asked to ask you what are the most shockingly passionate this is in eric's language what are the most shockingly passionate mathematical structures and he gave a list of four for him but he said he really wanted your list okay let me say that shockingly passionate uh-huh mathematical structures shocking k is there something you can is there something that jumps to mind sure i'm here to shock about this yeah so first of all eric weinstein is a very dear friend i have to say and i really really really appreciate and love him he's just like my brother so you know it's it's interesting to to have a question posed by him and maybe if we can linger for a moment what what do you think is special about eric weinstein for you know of his work and his mind mhmm the way he sort of straddles so many different disciplines it's like a renaissance man there are very few people like that at any given moment let alone the twenty first century where information has become so you know huge that it's almost physically impossible to be able to keep track of things and yet he does and he has his own unique vision and unique point of view and he has integrity which is like almost impossible like i can't think of so many people who possess that those qualities almost no one and also the ability in some sense to to embody the balance that you talked about of both the rigor of mathematics mhmm and the the imagination humanity also would say you know like we talk about imagination as a kind of a counterpoint to knowledge or logic but just basic humanity you know just be basic just compassion just being able to because every destructive i would say like every destructive society you know like be it germany you know under hitler or soviet union under stalin and so on was based on some kind of what was considered unassailable truths mhmm so a kind of conceptual system you know if you think about it right there is a beautiful episode of this series by jacob branovsky you know where he talks about he filmed it in auschwitz talking about the certainty that what led the nazis to be killing people wholesale was a certain it's almost a mathematical idea and they just basically bought into this idea and checked out their humanity at the door so i would say that antidote to this type of thing is not necessarily even imagination in a kind of elevated sense that we have been discussing today that is exemplified by our greatest scientists and philosophers but just basic humanity you know basic human basic common sense of just like knowing that this is not right and i don't care what my what my ideology tells me but i'm just not going to do it so that i think is kind of missing a little bit in today's society people get a lot too caught up in in the ideology in in certain conceptual frameworks so societies that lose that basic human compassion that basic humanity run into trouble oh very much so but not only society like a human being and eric is one of the people i agree with you keeps that flame of your like i i trust that you will not do something that's not human that's not right i just feel you know like there's some some people you just kind of feel that they won't cross that line yeah and that's a huge thing you know to today because i have to say looking back definitely i have not heard people personally but like i could be mean for instance i could be harsh and now i see it as a sign of weakness as a sign of insecurity you know i saw i saw your interview with ray kurzweil mhmm the other day beautiful i was really moved by it but you know at some point i was like i i looked at him at this sort of like doctor evil i was i'm kind of ashamed of it now but like you know i'm i'm kind of coming clean and i would be you know because well why because i needed an adverse adversary in my mind mhmm because i projected onto him kind of the fears that i had that we will be the ai will conquer us and so on and this was rooted in my kind of awakening moment in a sense a kind of a moment where i suddenly started to see the other side so but i wasn't sure yet you see you had to feel it so i had to have a fight about it yeah you had to actually have the projection i had to let so it was not in i believe that it was not in me already so i had to throw it onto somebody yeah and that's not balance yet so balance is when you recognize that it's you actually and i had this moment actually it was so amazing like i would give this mean i would talk about ai and the dangers and he would always be my foil you know i would put a sinister photograph of him on the slide and it's like look at this guy he wants to put nanobots into your brain and he's also like high end high top executive at google and so on like so i would create this whole narrative and then something happened where i was giving a lecture this is twenty fifteen at the in in aspen aspen ideas festival which is a wonderful festival it's a keynote speech actually and i and i was doing my my usual stick and then suddenly i said i came up to that and there was a big screen and there was a picture of him there and i came up to the screen and i kind of touched it with my hand and i said but i don't want to pick on mister guzman because he's me i had this revelation that i'm actually fighting with myself with my own fears and and then i learned about his his his father that his father died when he was young and that he's in fact he's very to his credit he's very sincere and upfront about it self disclosure i think is very essential by the way in all this discussion like what really motivates you he said it he said it publicly many times even as as early as twenty fifteen i could find this information that he wanted to re reunite with his father in the cloud and suddenly i saw him not as a caricature that exemplified all my fears but as a human being who a child longing for his father grieving for his father so suddenly it became a story a love story mhmm and you know so that is so in other words i've seen it in myself this capacity to project my own fears and then fight with other people over something that actually was my own and as soon as i got to this point of seeing him and then my next lecture actually i talked about it about him in this way and i and i said look you know it's a it's a love story and he is actually and it's not how i would want to reunite with my father but like you said you know the the if i am consistent i have to allow the possibility that different people perceive things differently and so for him that's his imagination so you know how who is this voltaire i think is ascribed to voltaire it's like i disagree with you but i will fight to death for you to have the right to say it so now that i i feel like my position is more like i disagree with him that this is the way to to approach death and to approach the death of loved loved ones and how we miss them and how we you know the sense of loneliness and inability to interact directly that that's not something that it is nice with me but i think it's also it can also be called imagination from his perspective and look motivated by that how much he has brought how many interesting inventions like his musical invention for instance naturally because his father was a composer a music composer and a and a conductor so in other words from a in a bigger scheme of things even if i think he's misguided still i can't deny that it's a certain leap of faith from his perspective to try to say that this is the way we can all connect to our loved ones and because it is sincere and i see it now as sincere and in fact in your interview you really teased it out to him and i was really moved by it i have to say it's like he can smell it a little bit too i said you know it was really really sweet when he talked about his father and i can relate you know my father died four years ago and i can relate what a heartbreak i was much older than ray was when his father died but i can relate to this to this longing and that grief you know and when he is somebody is sincere and he puts his opens his cards and you know and says this is why this is what i want to do it because i want to recreate my father and want to be able to talk to him this way then we have a serious then we understand you know the opposite of it would be not risk closing and just pretending that this is how it's supposed to be in scientific terms so it is replacing your real emotion that come from the heart by some kind of a theory which comes from the mind and this is where we can go astray because then we get become captives of of frameworks and conceptual systems which may not be beneficial to our society in tough times we need the people that have not lost their way in the ideologies we need the people who are still in touch with their heart and you you mentioned this with with eric it's certainly true i disagree with him on a lot of stuff mhmm but i feel like when the world is burning down eric is one of the people that's you can still count on to have a heart i've talked a lot over the past year about the war in ukraine and the possibility of nuclear war and it feels like he's one of the people i would call first if if god forbid something like a nuclear war will begin because you you look for people with a heart no matter their ideas that's right it takes courage and it takes a certain self awareness i would say and which brings me you know i think the crucial is that that which was inscribed you know on the temple of apollo and delphia there was a statement know know thyself know yourself you know like who am i ultimately it goes down to this and all these debates and the point is that i was like i used to be like i said you know pessimistic at some point and i was scared even of where development of ai was going this is about twenty fourteen twenty fifteen and now i'm much more so for instance after i saw ray kurzweil mhmm as a human being after i could relate to him and sympathize with him suddenly i i stopped seeing him in the news like before that i would always see him in the news saying we're going to put nanobots in your brain da da da by the year two thousand and thirty whatever you know and then we upload you to the twenty by the twenty first and i would be like no you know the story is terrible suddenly i didn't see him anymore i had to you know yeah so now makes me question who was creating the trouble what was all within you was it him who was creating the stirring the trouble or was it my mind you see and so as i become as i became self aware suddenly other possibilities opened and suddenly that conflict which by the way if i kept giving this nasty you know talks about him one one day i suppose we'd have a debate and so you have this one person stays this and then yeah and what i learned is that it never it's a never ending conflict this conflict just does not end but there is an alternative there is a better way which is to realize that it is you arguing with yourself now if you want to continue arguing with yourself continue as long as it you need just be careful not to destroy too many things you know in the process but there is an option of actually dropping it of actually dropping it this is so i was so surprised by this yeah it's discovering in yourself the capacity the human capacity for compassion and you understand that he has a perspective he is operating in the space of imagination a human being like you and we're all in this kind of together trying to be solved on this boat ultimately and also it's like with realizing how much i have screwed up you know comes with humility also yeah so like i i find it extremely hard now to like really lash out at somebody and to say like you're horrible whatever because immediately the question is who am i to criticize you know so is there another way to have a dialogue is there a way to you know speaking you know since we talked about the innocence of a child and how much it drives a discovery in science and so on you know i remember it was i think i heard of adyashanti who gave this nice example he's like when you're a kid you know you go and you you play with your friends and then you fight with another kid and he was like i hate you i don't want to see you again and you just go home like after half an hour okay what are you going to do you want to play so you come out it's like hey you want to play you don't talk about what happened you don't rehash this you know just keep going and some time i think we are on the verge maybe of learning that because i think that if we are con if we continue to push each of us our set of ideas and like ideologies and like you know what matters to us and so on like yeah but no no what matters to you but like there are other ways to approach other people there are other ways that you can find point of contact speaking of which mathematics mathematical formulas are universal represent universal knowledge two plus two is four whether you vote for this guy or that guy in the election you know how about that as a com as point of of contact of commonality you know and nobody can patent those formulas did you know that and there is a supreme court decision mhmm that mathematical formulas cannot be patented like einstein could not patent equal e equals mc squared it doesn't belong to him because if the formula is correct then it belongs to everyone so what do you think of that all too tricky question and if you want i can deeply bias your answer by giving the list of four that eric provided oh no let me give my mine i cannot see by the way what you have so but i can guess some of them so i'm not i'm going to try to do something different from him so i already mentioned one which is that you have one dimensional numerical system which is real numbers you have two dimensional which is complex numbers you have four dimensional and it's kinda it's probably connected to what he wrote because it has to do with some homotopy groups of spheres and stuff like that then of course one i love okay one plus two plus three plus four mhmm plus five plus six and so on does it make any sense the sum you you probably heard about this one it became very popular at some point one plus two plus three i did a i did a video for numberphile the the youtube channel about it maybe ten years ago so one plus two plus three plus four plus five ostensibly diverges goes to infinity because you get a bigger and bigger number mhmm and yet there is a way to make sense of it in which it it comes up to minus one over twelve how fascinating first of all the answer is not even a positive number and it's not an integer it's not a whole number it's minus one over twelve so sometimes people ask me what is your favorite number and it's a kind of a joke i say minus one over twelve it's actually forty two so your favorite number is not an ordered set right so what else what else so the language program of course i have to mention that and we'll we'll explore that in-depth do you want do you want do you know what eric said sure sphere version boyse surface hop vibration co vibration okay and pi one of s o three okay oh yes so that's the that's the famous cup trick you know okay look so this is how it works no tricks no tricks no magic in all honesty it is magical okay but not not because i'm tricking you so you start with a bottle like this or a cup and you start twisting it at the same time you twist your your arm mhmm then you come so this is actually going to rotate it three hundred sixty degrees the full turn then you say okay i'm going i i won't be able to do another turn because then my arm would really get twisted i'll have to go see a doctor yes yet if i do it second time it untwists this is the pie one of so three mhmm that eric was talking about yes so there is something where the first motion is not trivial but if you double down on it mhmm you come back to the initial position it's very closely connected to the fact that we have elementary particles of two types bosons and fermions so bosons are for example photons or carriers of other forces or the higgs boson it is called a boson for a reason because it is a boson in honor of an indian mathematician bose bose and einstein so these particles obey what's called bose einstein statistics but then there are other particles called fermions in honor of enrico fermi italian born mathematician who worked in in the us and and they follow what's called dirac fermi statistics and those are electrons and or constituents of matter electrons protons neutrons and so on and they have a certain duplicity if you will and that duplicity is rooted mathematically in this in this experiment this little experiment that i have just done so i can i imagine speaking of imagination okay yeah so i'm just kind of briefing on this imagine a world in which this will not be shocking or like in this case it's not even shocking because i haven't really explained the details because i can't do it in two minutes i i indicated what this is all about and so on but imagine a world in which this is not foreign to most people that most people have seen it before or they're not afraid to approach this type of questions because you know we talked a little bit about math education but i really believe that a lot of people in our society and not it is not not only in the united states but throughout the world a lot of people have been traumatized it's really ptsd that's why people when they see a mathematical formula or like even like calculate they need to calculate tip on a bill they it's just they're terrified because it brings up those memories when they were kids and being called to blackboard and solve a problem you can't solve a problem an unscrupulous teacher says you're an idiot sit down and you feel ashamed and and and you know lowly and that stays with you and so i think that unfortunately that's where we are but i but what what can dream and so my dream is that one day we'll be able to overcome this and actually all of these treasures of mathematics will become widely widely available or at least people will know where to find them and they will not be afraid of going there and looking and i think this will help because like i said for one thing it gives you a sense of belonging it gives you it kind of it's an antidote to the the kind of alienation and separation that we feel today oftentimes because of ideological divide sectarian strife and all kinds of things like that because the then you will once you see there's like a critical mass of this beauty that kind of like dawns on you it's like my god this is what we all have in common you mentioned lang lang's program mhmm we have to talk about it sure at the core of your book and your work is the langlands program can you describe what it is sure so langlands is a mathematician it's the name of a mathematician robert langlans canadian born still alive he is was a professor at the institute for advanced study that we talked about where einstein and godel and other great scientists have worked in fact he used to occupy the office of albert einstein at the institute for advanced study so he in in the in the late sixties he came up with a set of ideas which captivated a lot of mathematicians several generations of mathematicians by now which came to be known as the language program and what it is about is connecting different fields of mathematics which seem to be far away from each other for example number theory which as the name suggests deals with numbers and various equations with you know like x squared plus y squared equals one mhmm and on the other side harmonic analysis something that any music lover can appreciate because the sound of a symphony can be kind of decomposed into sounds of different instruments and each of those sounds can be represented by a wave like this like a sine function those are the harmonics they escalate the period of harmonic periods of different notes are different they correspond to different notes and different instruments different semitones if you will but they all combine together into something diff something special which which is not cannot be reduced to any one of those so it's the mathematically it's the idea that you can decompose a signal into as a collection as a simultaneous oscillation of several elementary signals that's called harmonic analysis so what langlands found is that some really difficult questions in number theory could be translated into much more easily tractable questions in harmonic analysis that was his initial idea but what happened next surprised everybody that the kind of patterns that he was able to observe the kind of regularities that he was able to observe which were quite surprising were subsequently found in other areas of mathematics for example in geometry and eventually in quantum physics so in fact ed wheaton who is a kind of a dean of modern theoretical physicist professor at the institute for advanced study as well got interested in this subject i i described in my book how it happened and he was instrumental in in bridging the gap between these patterns in found in physics and in geometry finding kind of a a substratum a kind of a superstratum if you will it's kind of or kind of a way to connect these two things kind of a bridge between these two fields so i subsequently collaborate with witten on on this and this has been one of the major themes of my research it's sort of i always found it interesting to connect things to unite things when i was younger i couldn't i couldn't understand why but i was always interested in when when not in working in specific field by kind of cut but kind of cutting across fields and and then i i would discover that for instance i took some people who know what happens in this field but don't know what happens in that field and or conversely and then i would i would like find it imperative to go out and explain to them to the different sides what this is all about so that more people are aware of this hidden structure so this hidden parallels if you will so that's has been sort of a theme in my research and so i guess you know now i kind of understand more why it's kind of balance you know like the what we talked about earlier so can you elucidate a little bit how what are the mathematical tools that allow you to connect these different continents of mathematics right so is there something you can convert into words that langlands was able to find find and you were able to explore further i would say what it suggests is that there is some an an hidden principles which we still don't understand my my view is that we still don't know why that we can prove some instances of this correspondences and connections but we still don't know the real underlying reasons which means that there is a new lay there's a certain layer beneath the surface that we see now mhmm it is like the so the way i see it now is like this that there is something three-dimensional like this bottle but what we are seeing is this projection onto the table and the projection to wall and then we can map things from one projection to another and you say oh my god that's incredible but the real explanation is that both of them are projections of the same thing and that we haven't found yet but that's what i want to find so that's what motivates me i would say from number theory to geometry to quantum physics so there is this one thing which has different projections except it's not just the table and the wall but there are like many different walls if you will so what is the philosophical implication that there's commonalities like that across these very disparate fields it means that what what we believe are the fundamental elements of of mathematics are not fundament there there there is something beyond it's like we previously thought that atoms were indivisible then we found out that there is a nucleus and electrons and the nucleus consists of protons and neutrons then we thought okay protons and neutrons must be elementary now we know they consist of quarks so it's it's about kind of finding the quarks of mathematics of course beyond that there's maybe even more which was my initial motivation to study mathematics by the way right so quarks was the first time you fell in love with understanding the nature of reality yep what was it like working with ed witten who many people say is one of the smartest humans in history or at least mathematical physicists in history yes fascinating i enjoy it i enjoyed it very much i also felt they have to keep up you know and so we wrote this long paper in two thousand and seven and we collaborated for about a year i have known him before and we talked before and we have i've seen him since and we talked but it's very different to just meet somebody at conferences and have a conversation as opposed to actually working on a project together so he's very very very very serious very focused this is one thing which i have to say i was really struck by this why is he considered to be such a powerful intellect by many other powerful intellects he had he has had this unique vision of the subject he was able to connect different things especially find connections between quantum physics and mathematics almost unparalleled i i don't think anyone comes close in some sense in the last you know fifty years to him in terms of finding just consistently time after time breaking ground new ground new ground so he would basically one way one could describe it is he would take some idea in physics and and then find an interpretation of it in mathematics and then say distill it present it in mathematical terms and tell mathematicians this should be like that you know kind of like one plus two plus three plus four is minus one over twelve and mathematicians would be like no way and then it would pan out and mathematicians would then like like a whole industry would be created of groups of mathematicians trying to prove his conjectures and his his ideas and he would always be proven right you know so in other words being able to glean some mathematical truths from physical theories that's one side on the other hand conversely applying sophisticated mathematics let's see he's probably the physicist who kind of could learn mathematics the fastest i don't think i some younger physicists maybe could come close but it's still quite for them a long way to go to to get you know to be comparable to wheaton to take some of the most sophisticated mathematics and not learn it to the point where it becomes a practitioner of the subject practically and then use it to gain some new insights on the physics side now of course the thing is that the theory is that physics one could say is in a sort of a crisis in some sense because of a current gap between the sophisticated theories which came from applying sophisticated mathematics and the actual universe so we have theories first which describe ten dimensional worlds ten dimensional space time coming from string theory and things like that but we don't know yet how to apply it to understanding our universe a lot of progress has been made but it's kind of a at at a kind of impasse right now and at the same time the our most realistic theories most advanced theories of the four dimensional universe are in contradiction with each other and the standard model describing the three four known forces of nature the electromagnetic strong and weak to with great accuracy and einstein's relativity which describes the fourth called gravity everybody everybody above a certain age knows that one yeah so these two theories are in contradiction at the moment and string theory was one of the the promise of string theory was that it would unify those two and so far it has not has not happened so we are kind of at a very interesting place right now and i think that new ideas perhaps are needed and i i wouldn't be surprised if wheaton is one of those people who come up with those ideas well he has been one of the one of the people that added a lot of ideas under the flag of string theory what do you think about this theory what do you think is beautiful about it string theory well first of all kind of re you remember we talked about pythagoreans and how for pythagoreans the whole world was the symphony where you have these different vibrations of all the humans every human is a vibration every every animal you know every being every tree and every celestial body and so on so string theory is kind of like that because in string theory there is this fundamental object which is a vibrating string and all particles are in a sense supposed to be different modulations or vibrations of that string so that by itself is already interesting that you kind of describe this diversity of various particles and interactions between them using one guiding principle in some sense but also just the mathematical things that come out of it the the kind of it it looks like impossible to satisfy various constraints and then there is sort of like a unique way to do it so the that's sort of the every time that happens when you know you have some system over like overdetermined system let's suppose you have to do do like five interviews in one in one day yeah and you wake up in the morning and you're like that's impossible because then so many things have to align for instance let's suppose you have to go from one place to another mhmm so then you have a commute and then who knows maybe there is a traffic jam and stuff like that and now suppose that it all works seamlessly and there were like a bunch of places where it could have gone hope hopelessly wrong and it didn't and then in the evening you're like wow it worked that's beautiful right that's kind of like great luck you know we would say but in science this happens sometimes that you have this theory which not supposed to work because there are so many seemingly contradictory demands on it and yet there is a sweet spot where they balance each other so string theory is kind of like this the unfortunate aspect of it is that it balances itself in ten dimensions and not in four so maybe there is another universe somewhere but see as a mathematician for me all spaces are created equal yeah ten dimensional four dimensional so mathematicians love string theory because it has given us so much so much food for thought but do you think it's a a correct or a incorrect theory for understanding this reality so it might be a theory that explains some tenth dimensional reality in some other universe but is it potentially what do you think are the odds again financial advice you are to bet what do you think are the odds that it gets us closer to understanding this reality well in the form that it is now that seems unlikely but it could well be that based on these ideas with some modifications with some essential new elements it could it could work out so i would say right now it doesn't look so good like from the point of view that we of what we from what we know mhmm but maybe somebody will come and introduce like square root of negative they didn't tell you i mean they already introduced but i mean kind of like as a metaphor yeah maybe somebody will come and say what if we do this it looks crazy you know speaking of niels bohr he had this famous quote that he said to somebody there is no doubt that your theory is crazy the question is whether it's crazy enough to describe reality so that's where we are kind of you know speaking of crazy and crazy enough let me ask for for therapy for advice for wisdom in returning to eric weinstein and maybe give some guidance to understanding his view on his attempt at theory of everything that he called geometric unity that he told me that you may have some inkling of an under understanding of if you were to describe this theory to aliens that visited earth how would you do it or you could try if it was just me visiting earth how would you describe it your best understanding of it he he shared with me some of it when i was in new york at columbia like eleven years ago we actually spent a lot of time where he explained to me and i found it beautiful he has a very original idea at the at the core of it where you have this instead of four dimensional instead of ten dimensional he has fourteen dimensional space and i thought was it was really original and this is exactly goes to the point i made earlier that we need new ideas i feel that without some fundamental new idea we won't be able to get closer to understanding our universe now i have a problem with the whole idea of theory of everything you know i don't believe that one exists nor nor that we should aim to construct one and i think it's it's really not not to offend anybody but it's ultimately a fault of education system of physicists like in mathematics we do not we're not brought up we're not educated as mathematicians with the idea that one day we will come up with the theory of everything even though as a joke i said that language program is mathematical theory of everything but i made it as kind of a tongue in cheek but isn't it a little bit kind of that it's not really because first of all it doesn't cover all fields of mathematics and it covers specific phenomena but isn't it spiritually striving towards the same platonic form of a theory of everything like connecting connecting connecting but connecting doesn't mean that it covers everything right so you could connect two things and then you have infinitely many other things which are outside of the purview of this connection that's how it is in mathematics i i i feel and i would venture to say that most mathematicians look at it this way like there is no idea that somehow i think it's actually impossible because we're not talking about such a thing as like one universe we're talking about all possible universes of all possible dimensions and so on it is just not feasible to have a unified unify everything in one equation now physicists on the other hand have been brought up educated for decades with this idea and to me and i i am not sure i should say that but i feel like it's like a kind of an ultimate ego trip so that i have come up with the unified i have found the entire theory of everything it's me and it's me my name will be on it i think a lot of physicists get educated this way especially men take it seriously yeah and i've seen that happen and i think it is counterproductive i think that a lot of people do agree that this debate is kind of i feel like it's kind of settled i think i i hear it less and less but i disagree with the whole premise so you it's interesting because because both are interesting points you made which is you don't think a theory of everything exists and you don't think the pursuit of a theory of everything is good so i think you spoke to the second thing which is basically that the pursuit of a theory of everything becomes like a drug to the human ego that's right so it it it's a huge motivating factor i don't deny that but i feel that it's there are better ways to motivate people than like that than this way okay so i would say for instance if one because then it's not a game of winner takes all in some sense and in fairness when physicists say theory of everything grand unified theory they mean something very specific which is unifying the standard model and einstein's relativity theory which is the theory of gravity so they don't necessarily a lot of physicists may say these words but they don't really mean them i think it's important to realize that that in my opinion that's not productive and it's not feasible anyway so having said that there are some theories that are better than others obviously so for instance eric's theory has as far as i understand does have a certain way of producing some of the elementary particles that we see and as well as the force of gravity so it does have that promise i feel that from at least from the place where i had seen it about ten years ago it still required a lot of work to get to the point of actually saying that it does work because you know a lot of there are a lot of elements it's a it's a huge enterprise to have a theory because you have just to describe the fields sort of the the bay the building blocks of the theory it's already tremendous undertaking and he's trying to do it for for curved spaces in greater generality which is what makes it so unique and so beautiful but then there are on top of that there are all this issue of quantization of actually describing them as quantum field theory and the quantum field theory even as a language as a framework is currently incomplete in my opinion and not only my opinion it's like everybody's it's everybody agrees on that that it's a it's a it's a collection of tricks so to speak it's a collection of tools it's a toolbox but it is not a a consistent rigorous theory like number theory mhmm in mathematics physicists has still have still been able to derive predictions from it by and confirm them with to great accuracy but the underpinnings that that that it doesn't have the real rigorous foundation from mathematical perspective so in that sense even if in that framework a new theory could lead to an explanation of some some new explanation of some phenomena it would still be incomplete in a sense because it wouldn't be mathematical regress you see what i mean because the whole framework is not yet on on a firm foundation so it's not consistent why is it that the universe should have so that's to your first point do you think the universe has a beautiful clean when you show up and meet god and there's one equation on the board and the two of you just chuckle do you think such equation exists yeah there are there are such equation for instance let's say i am interested in a particular question right so in the language program say so moving away from physics so let's talk about math so in in the context of language program i have recently developed with my coauthors aetin gopf and kashdan a kind of a new friend strand a new flavor of the language program if you will but so far it's a sort of it's a vision it's a set of conjectures which we have proved in some cases but not in full generality so yes i would like to to use your framework for me the creator mhmm and ask her what is the explanation of this mhmm and it may well be that she will answer in a way that i will i will just burst out laughing it's like how could we not see it mhmm you see so that i totally see but i don't see one equation governing one one equation governing them all not one equation to govern them all but it does seem that such equations exist where she will tell you something and you look back and say how could i not see it it seems like the the truth at the end of the day is simple that we're seeking especially through mathematics it seems somehow simple the the the nature of reality the thing that governs it seems to be simple i wonder why that is and i also wonder if it's not totally incorrect and we're just craving the simplicity and then mixing into the whole conversation about how much the observer that craves simplicity is part of the answer it's a whole big giant mess or a whole a whole big beautiful painting or symphony you said of eric weinstein that i find it remarkable that eric was able to come up with such beautiful and original ideas even though he has been out of academia for so long yes doing wonderful things in other areas such as economics and finance i'd like to use that kind of quote as as just a question to you about different places where people of your level can operate so inside academia and outside what is the difference of doing mathematics inside academia and outside just not even mathematics but developing beautiful original ideas where's the place that your imagination can flourish most so the the the limitations of academia is there's a community of people that take a set of axioms as gospel so it's harder to take that leap into the unknown but it's also the nice thing about academia is some of the most brilliant people in the world are there it's that community both the competition and the collaboration is there mhmm yeah i wonder if there's something you could say sort of to further about this world that people might not be familiar with but i think you you gave a very good description i'm not sure i could improve on on it because i don't have an overarching theory of academia academia yes i definitely have been part of it and i'm grateful because it is it gives you great sense of security which comes with its own downside too because you kind of like get a little disconnected from the real world because mhmm you get tenure so you feel financial secure you know they don't pay you that much so to speak you know relatively speaking and it's comfortable but it's not that much but you you can't be fired so there is something about this which i definitely have benefit from it you know and it it does people are not even aware what it's like to to live outside of a where you can't you where you don't have this type of security on the other hand that also means that we're lacking certain skills that sort of real people in the real world have developed out of necessity to deal with that sort of insecurity so it kind of always cuts both ways you know in one hand it gives and with the other hand it takes away and it's a very interesting setup and also on the one hand we are all supposed to be the truth seekers and but in reality of course it is a human activity and it is a human community and it was all kinds of good bad and ugly things that happen a lot of them under the radar screen so to speak and so but maybe there is something to it to there is definitely there are definitely people who are upholding kind of that old tradition definitely and that is inspiring and i aspire to be you know one of those to my best so whether this is a system that will stay or should stay i don't know i really don't know that's really fast yeah it's it's it's fascinating what especially with it just to introduce the bit of ai poison into the mix as that changes the nature of education perhaps as well what the role of the university is in the next ten twenty fifty hundred years i wonder i wonder and i wonder that you know how do you make sense that einstein was working after attempting i believe to be a university professor mhmm or is this most to the patent office yeah as a patent clerk although but i have to say to these days the the science has become so much faster it is really hard to do it being outside now eric is unique in this way even though he did you know go to great undergraduate and graduate you know school schools but and then worked for a while in academia there are very few examples like this this is yutang zhang who proved the an important conjecture number theory about ten years ago and is now as i understand is a professor at uc santa barbara he worked outside of academia and was able to make tremendous advance on his own this case is exceedingly rare in part because academia is trying to protect its turf and it's kind of it's it's creating this sort of prohibitive cost of of of an outsider that is true but there is also something about how much how much concentration in mathematics i don't think people who are not who are not in the field understand what kind of focus and concentration actually doing like mathematics at at at the top level these days requires because we're not talking about something that is more or less good it is something which is unassailable you know it's finding this treasure at the bottom of the ocean you know without you know the acolung you know without oxygen and that's why you know it's it's not people go crazy sometimes you know but there is a reason for that well let me let me ask about that sort of just to to linger on that the amount of concentration required cal newport wrote a book called deep work he's a theoretical computer scientist he took quite seriously the the task of allocating the hours and the day for that kind of deep thinking and then the mathematicians is is theoretical computer scientists on steroids so for your own life and what you've observed let me ask the big question how to think how to think deeply how to find the mental psychological pragmatic space to really sit there and think deeply how do you do it in the moments do you remember where you really deeply thought what was it an accident was it deliberate no it's deliberate because you know first of all my first years as a mathematician you know i worked every day weekends holidays doesn't matter i didn't even question that so i would feel something's missing if i took a day off mhmm and you know so it was just a kind of a sustained effort the point is that still the process is nonlinear to to to go back to what we discussed earlier that in other words the way i see it is you just you are making an effort to to bring all the information into focus what you believe is correct and you're playing with different ways of connecting things but it is a total miracle when it when suddenly there is insight strikes mhmm it is not something that in my experience could be predicted or even anticipated you know or like brought closer there is a famous story about einstein that he used to you know go think think think and then go for a walk and like he would whistle sometimes so i remember the first time i heard of this story i thought how interesting what a coincidence that he this came to him when he was whistling but in fact it's not this is how it works in some sense that you have to prepare for it but then the moment it happens when you stop thinking actually so the moment of discovery is the moment when thinking stops and in a way you kind of you kind of almost become that truth that you're seeking but you cannot do it by will in some sense it's some it's kind of like you know how in the eastern tradition they have this concept of satori like in buddhism in zen buddhism they have this satori which is enlightenment and so the the various reports of buddhist monks or buddhist masters who have had experienced satori but they say you can't you can't do it by will you cannot make it happen if anything you have to relax to let it come to you you know it's kind of like that it's kind of like that so i think that what matters but you say how to think the point is that we're talking about such an esoteric area mathematics is really esoteric area it's a really strange subject where you try to to fit everything in this very very stringent set of rules to obey those set of those rules isn't it basically the the pure the hardest manifestation of a puzzle that we're all solving in different other disciplines but this is the the hardest puzzle that's placed yes and no because there is just a different for instance there is a different criterion for what constitutes progress for instance physics a lot of arguments they make they are not rigorous from mathematical perspective it is kind of an intuitive argument we think it is like this and this is acceptable in the subject for a good reason and on the so there is some play it's more it's more like human activity day to day activity like for instance you and i discuss something you have an idea and i have an idea and we argue about it and something seems more plausible something seems less plausible and so we may decide to take this point of view or that point of view as a provisional sort of like point of view and go with it in mathematics it doesn't work this way you either prove it or you don't and oftentimes you get to the point where there is this much you need to prove and it just it just wouldn't wouldn't come to you and you just don't see it and it can have it can go on for months super frustrating but without it it is it is nothing kind of you know i would love to hear your opinion to the degree that you know it of the proof of fermat's last theorem mhmm by andrew wiles which seems to have this element perhaps for years to the degree that you know perhaps can you explain fermat's last theorem mhmm and what your thoughts are in the process that andrew wiles took that seemed to at least from my sort of romantic perspective seemed to be very lonely yes it's a lonely profession and hopeless and and like and sort of the the you put it really nicely because it's it it feels like there's a lot of moments where you feel like you're close you feel like ninety nine percent is done yeah and there's this one stubborn thing which just does not compute you know doesn't happen and you're trying to find that push for this last link and it could take and nobody knows how long it's gonna take would it be useful to maybe try to explain fermat's last theorem sure it's easy to do i am an optimist i'm an optimist i think i always think that everything can be explained you know even though i say that not everything can be explained but in in mathematics you know in within this particular framework i think that i always feel optimistic when people ask me to explain something i i always start with the assumption that they will understand yes you know so let's try fermat's last theorem one of the jewels sort of of mathematics of all time a beautiful story also behind it pierre fermat a great french mathematician who lived in the beginning of mostly worked at the beginning of what seventeenth century and he actually has to his credit a number of important contributions mhmm but the most famous is called fermat's last theorem or fermat's great theorem and the reason why it became so famous is in part because he actually claimed to have proved it himself and he did it on the margin of a of a book that he was reading which was actually important book by deophantus about equations with coefficients and whole numbers and he wrote on the margin literally i this equation you know this problem which i will explain in a moment i have solved it i have found a proof but this margin is too small to contain it mhmm at some point i i give i was giving a public talk about this and i made it as a joke i made a tweet mhmm in which i wrote that i have proved this theorem but two hundred eighty characters are not enough and it kind of cuts me in mid sentence yeah so this was seventeenth century twitter style proof okay but a lot of mathematicians took it seriously because he had great credibility he did did made did make some major contributions and the search was on so for three fifty years about three fifty years it remained unproved with many people trying and failing until in nineteen ninety four no in nineteen ninety three andrew wiles announced a mathematician from princeton university announced the proof and it was very exciting because he was one of the top number theorists in the world and unfortunately about a year later a gap was found so this is exactly what we were talking about earlier you have ninety nine percent of the proof this one little thing does not quite connect and this nullifies the whole thing even though well you could say there are some interesting ideas but it's not the same as actually having a proof so he apparently was really frustrated and he was really a lot of people thought that it's going to be another hundred years or whatever and then luckily he was able to enlist with with the help assistance with of his former student but also great number theorist richard taylor they were able to do that one percent so to speak well some people might say it's maybe not one but five percent or whatever but it definitely was an important ingredient but it was not he had a sort of like a big new set of ideas and this one thing didn't pan out they were able to close it with taylor and in it finally was published and i think was accepted and refereed in ninety five and since and is believed to be correct now what he proved actually was not fermat's theorem itself but a certain statement which is called shimura taniyama wei conjecture named after three mathematicians two japanese mathematicians and one french born mathematician who worked in also the institute for advanced study in in in in princeton and it was my colleague at uc berkeley ken ribbit who in the eighties connected the two problems so this is how it often works in mathematics you want to prove statement a instead you prove that a is equivalent to b so after that if you can prove b this would automatically imply that a is correct so this is what happened here a was fermat's last theorem b was shymurti neumann wave conjecture and that's what andrew wiles and richard taylor really proved so it requires to get to fermat's last theorem it requires that bridge which was established by my colleague ken ribbet at uc berkeley so now what is the statement of fermat's last theorem let me start with pythagoras since we already talked about it let me start with pythagoras theorem which describes the right triangles so what is a right triangle it's a triangle in which one of the angles is ninety degrees like this so it has three sides the longer side is called hypotenuse and then there's two other sides so if we denote the hypoits the lengths of hypotenuse by z and the two other sides x and y then z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared so that's the equation or x squared plus y squared equals z squared and it turns out that this equation has solutions in natural numbers many actually infinitely many solutions in natural numbers for example if x is you take x equals three mhmm y equals four and z equals five then they solve this equation because three three squared is nine four squared is sixteen nine plus sixteen twenty five and that's five squared so x squared plus y squared equals z squared is solved by x equals three y equals four z equals five and there are many other solutions of that nature and we should say that natural numbers are whole numbers that are nonnegative that's right one two three four five six and so on now what's fermat's last theorem fermat asked what about what will happen if we replace squares by cubes for example so x cube plus y cube equals z cube are there any solutions in what do you call natural numbers mhmm it turns out there are none what about fourth powers again none well it seems like none right and that's- so that was a that was a statement so this theorem says that the equation x cube plus y cube equals z cube has no solutions in natural numbers remember natural means positive whole numbers so of course there is a trivial solution zero zero zero so that this works but you need all of them to be positive x to the fourth plus y to the fourth equals z to the fourth also has no solutions x to the fifth plus y to the fifth equals z to the fifth no solutions so you kind of see the trend x to the n plus y to the n plus equals z to the n if n is greater than two there's no solutions in natural numbers that is a statement of fermat's last theorem deceptively simple as far as famous theorems are concerned you don't need to know anything beyond standard arithmetic mhmm addition and multiplication of natural numbers that's why a lot of people both specialists and amateurs mhmm try to prove it it's so tough because it's so easy to so telling is so easy to formulate so in fact i think fermat proved the case of cubes i think he did actually prove some elsewhere the case of cubes but so it remained like fourth there are infinitely many cases right you have to even if you prove it for cubes and for fourth power and fifth then still there's six sevens and so on there are infinitely many cases in which it has to be proved and so you see the simple result took three fifty years to prove and you know but in a sense it's like mathematicians you know you would think mathematics is such a sterile profession everybody's so serious you know almost like we're all wearing like lab coats yeah and like take an elevator to the to the to the to every tower yeah and however look at all this drama look at all this drama it's like we also like drama we also have narratives we also have our myths here is a guy he's a sixteenth century mathematician or seventeenth century mathematician who leaves a note on the margin and motivates others to find the proof then how many cards were broken that they believe that they found the proof and then later it was realized that the proof was incorrect and so on it brings us to modern day and one last attempt andrew weils who is very serious and respected and esteemed mathematician announces the proof only to be faced with the same reality of his hopes dashed seemingly dashed and like there is a mistake it doesn't work and then to be able to recover a year later how much drama in this one story yeah it's amazing but what from what you understand from what you know what was the process for him that that is similar perhaps to your own life mhmm of of of of walking along with the problem for months not years yes so he worked he he has given interviews about it afterwards so we know that he described his process that number one he did not want to tell anybody mhmm because he was afraid that people find out that he's working on it because he's was such a top level mathematician people would guess that he has some idea that there is some idea so you know if you just know that somebody's has an idea this already gives you a great boost of confidence right so he didn't want people to have that information mhmm so he didn't tell anybody that he was working on it number one be lonely number two he worked on it for seven years if i remember correctly by himself and then then he he thought he had it and he was elated obviously he was you know very happy and he announced it at a conference i think it was in cambridge university or oxford university in the uk in in nineteen ninety three i believe so you know this is really interesting because all of us we can all mathematicians can relate to this because i i remember very well my first problem how i solved my first problem i describe it in in love and math in my book so it was i was how old was i i was eighteen years old i was a student in moscow and i was just i just lucked out that i was introduced to this great mathematician since i you know i was not studying at moscow university because of antisemitism in the soviet union so i was in this technical school but i was lucky that i had a mathematician who took me under his wing and dmitri fuchs who actually later came to the to the us and he's still a professor at uc davis actually not so far from from me so he gave me this problem and it was rather technical so i will not try to describe it but i do remember how much effort you know the that excitement but also kind of a fear what if i don't have what it takes you know i lost sleep so this was one one consequence of this i for the first time in my life i had trouble falling asleep and this actually stayed for a couple years afterwards so then it was kind of like a wake up call that i should be take care of myself not work too late and so on so that was sort of like that experience and i was lucky that i was able to find a solution number one within two months maybe and it was very it was surprising and it was beautiful like it the answer was was in terms of some something which seemed to be from a different world from a different area of mathematics so i was very happy but i do remember this this moment when suddenly you see that just like you in this case it was literally i had to compile these diagrams with what mathematicians call cohomology groups and spectral sequences and manually calculate some some numbers and trying to discern some system in it and suddenly i saw that how they all were governed by this one one one force so to speak one pattern and that was absolutely wow so it's like i mean what was it so you're sitting there at a desk actually you know i lived in a town outside of moscow so i used to take i would take a train to moscow so it's what we call in russia you know like this electric train which was super slow and like took more than two hours to cover that distance and i think that the crucial insight came when i was in this and i just i was i had to contain myself so i don't start screaming you know because there were other passengers in the in the car so i was sitting there and staring at this paper so you know what i remember that's what came to me i i have something now which nobody else in the world has i have a proof of first of all i did not it was not just a proof like in the case of fermat the statement is already made that's why it's called conjecture you know you make a statement you don't have a proof yet then you try to prove it in my case i did not know what the answer would be there was a type of question where the answer was unknown so i had to find the answer and prove it and the answer was very nice so nobody knew as far as i could tell nobody knew because my teacher told me that he explored all the literature and this was not known so this was suddenly i felt that i was in possession of this now it was a little thing it was not cure for cancer you know yeah it was not a large language model you know but it was something undeniably real meaningful and it was mine kind of you know like i had it nobody else i had not published it i didn't even tell i hadn't even told anybody and it is a very strange feeling you know to have to have that were you worried that this treasure could be stolen not at the time not at the time so later on there were situations where i was exposed to that those type of experiences but at that time i didn't think of that i was still this starry eyed kid you know who was just obsessed with mathematics with this beauty and discovery discovering those beautiful facts beautiful results so i didn't think about i didn't even think that it could be possible that somebody could steal it or whatever i just wanted to share it with my teacher as soon as possible you know and and he he understood quickly and he's like yeah good job you know is there some something you can give color to the drama eric has talked eric weinstein has spoken about some of the challenges some of the triumphs and challenges of his time at harvard so is there some something to that drama of people stealing each other's ideas or not allocating credit enough oh sure yes all of that and yes and creating psychological stressors because of that happens all the time yes unfortunately on young minds and so on could have a very bad effect is that just the way of life or is this i think we can definitely do better and i think the first step is to kind of admit that we are not hundred percent seekers of truth that we are human beings and all the the good and bad and the ugly qualities can be present and to have some kind of dialogue in my subject yeah in mathematics but this has not happened yet there have been some famous cases where people have been accused which had been resolved mhmm or partially resolved or unresolved and everybody knows it but there isn't a systematic effort as far as i can tell of really trying to create some rules some ethics rules this is this is fair game this is not fair game so that as a community we strive to get better i think that for most people it's more like keeping your head in the sand and kind of pretending that it doesn't happen or it happens some isolated incidents well i don't my experience is not like that at all i think it does happen much more often than it should that's my opinion so there's the pool of academia is fascinating one of the reasons i really love it is you have young minds mhmm with fresh ideas and that that same innocence you had with when you're first on the train have that brilliant breakthrough mhmm and then you throw that in together with senior exceptional world class scientists who have first of all are getting older second of all maybe they have partaken in the drug of fame and money and status and recognition so that starts to a little bit corrupt all of our human minds and you throw that mix in together yeah mostly without rules and it's beautiful because that's where the ideas of old contend with the the new wild eyed crazy ideas and they clash and there's a tension and it's it there's a dance to it but then there's the old human corruption that can take advantage of the young minds it's unclear what to do with that i i mean part of that is just the way of life and there's tragedies mhmm and oftentimes when you look at who wins the nobel prize it's also tragic because sometimes so many minds are like the trajectory to the breakthrough idea involves so many different minds young and old this yeah i mean you're right it's i i think it's like every and it was everything else the the the true the the the path is to more self awareness and it's like owning up your own stuff and not blaming other people not projecting onto other people but taking responsibility and that's true for everything and the problem here unique problem for mathematics i would say physicists and chemist are better they have they actually have better sort of ethical rules and so on especially biologists like because i think in part it's because there is much more money involved because they have to get grants and so on so for them the question of priority who discovered what first is much more serious because there's really some serious money mathematics who cares you know that fermat's last theorem was proved yeah did andrew wiles become a millionaire no but i think he gave a prize even a prize but whose sizes are not but i think that one was a big prize but but in general there's not going to be he i think he won the abel prize eventually which is about a million dollars so but you know sometimes i joke about this that this is the hardest way to win a million dollars so you know but amongst mathematicians i think the trouble is that we are so insulated from society because it's such a pure subject it draws in very specific psychological types and i can speak about myself i did not realize it at the time but later on i definitely saw i mentioned some of it earlier that for me mathematics was a refuge from the cruelty of the life i experienced from discrimination that i experienced when i applied to moscow university at sixteen being failed at the exam and stuff like that which i describe in my book as well but that was my way i was like i don't trust this world i i don't want to deal with it i want to hide in this platonic reality of pure forms this is where i know how to operate i love this and and i couldn't be bothered in some sense for a while at up and up to a point as as i was getting older and more mature i was becoming more and more interested in other things but i think that's one of the reasons and one of the reasons why i wrote love and math was precisely to break that cycle that it's the it's the quiet guy in the corner that goes into math and not the flamboyant you know jock or like you know dj mhmm i wanted to show how beautiful the subject is to attract this new blood so that different psychological types and more women would join because then they would have t students who would look at them and whom they will inspire and then it would be instead of a vicious circle it would be a virtuous circle and i have to say i think it's happening not because of my efforts alone obviously there are many other mathematicians who are around the same time started to put more effort because see if the old stereotype of mathematician you're so enclosed you're not interested in even exposing the beauty of your subject to other people you see and then it becomes this vicious circle but you know this one day yeah you know i not one day all the time i meet i meet these students who say your book is the reason why i chose math as my major and i am proud especially when it's women who tell me this and they are cool they are djs at the same time and they are social and they have friends and they go out and so on you see so they are then they carry the torch because then they will be more likely to share this beauty with others to attract more students and so on so i think this this kind of this dumbness is broken so now you'll have more influx and once we have people who are more able to connect at the personal level that's when we also become more self aware as a community i think and that's when we might be we should be able to have a chance to improve in terms of our ethical rules and stuff like that so let me return to our friend eric weinstein for a question that i would ask anyway but let me let let's have a non russian ask the russian question ask him about the russian concepts of friendship science gender and love versus the american you can so there is a there is a deep romanticism that you have that runs through your book love and math is is part of that something you've picked up from the russian culture what can you speak to that fueled both your fascination with math and your fascination no your your prioritization of the human experience of love good question i definitely there is some influence of the russian culture russian literature perhaps you know but also you know like there are so many things how do you how do we develop certain sensibilities like why do we care about this and not that like why do i care for instance about like you said about this romantic ideal so to speak of mathematics that's certainly not something that is automatic you know some people care about it some people don't and i'm not saying it is superior or inferior it's just how my composition my psychological composition is like that and it's an interesting question like what is the cause of it so i think that we cannot really know but there are some aspects of it of course the experiences life experiences are upbringing family like i was you know i was surrounded by love by my parents on the one hand but in the on on the other side perhaps they were a little overprotective of me so i was kind of like you know too much kind of like taking taken care of so then when i when i had developed some sensitivity but i was kind of not ready for the challenges the real world of the real world so then that that's struggle and that and then being lost and then being able to overcome and to learn and then if you do in in others if you don't lose you don't appreciate maybe but sometimes when we lose something and then regain it then we cherish it we appreciate and then it becomes unimportant also various difficulties you know the upsetting experiences or one could say traumatic experiences growing up you know in the soviet union that was not a walk in the park you know it was there were a lot of issues there that i had to go through and and then it did it doesn't break you makes you stronger but in my case what happened was that you know some for some of it it took me thirty years to really come to terms with it and to really understand what happened it gave me this motivation to to strive to become mathematician which maybe i wouldn't have otherwise it charged me supercharged me i'm talking about for instance the experience with exam at moscow university can you take me through that experience so this is nineteen eighty four we spoke about orwell earlier and i was applying to moscow university mathematics department it's called mehmed which is like for people who don't know like the place was the only place to study pure mathematics in moscow period but also but also considered to be one of the great places on earth and it's like a huge building this you know this monolith of a building of moscow university so because as i said you know a year earlier evgeny evgenyevich converted me into math capitalizing on my love for physic quantum physics and so we i spent the whole year studying with him and i was already kind of at the level of you know in some in some subjects a level of like early graduate graduate studies so it seemed like it would be a breeze to go to get into moscow university but in fact little did i know that there was a policy of antisemitism where students like me would be failed by special examiners mostly during the oral exam with mathematics but occasionally it would be written tests and stuff now my father is jewish by blood it was not religious his family was not religious my mom is russian and but i was since my last name was my father's name so it was very easy to to read mhmm what my nationality was and so there was this can you imagine there were special people who would screen up applicants who would put aside the files of the undesirables mhmm there would be special examiners who were actually professors at this university who would be designated as those who would take the exam from those undesirables it was it's almost comical when you look back now and also like questions why there was no reason other than just hatred of the other that's how i see it and just to give a little bit more color so because you mentioned nationality it's a little quirk that perhaps gives an insight to the bigger system mhmm that the nationality listed on your birth certificate when you're jewish is jewish and when you're non jewish is is listed as russian for me it was russian so first of all in this in the inner part everybody has a internal passport mhmm and there you have first name patronymic name mhmm last name date of birth so these are four and the fifth colon is nationality which comes from the nationality of the parents and so on in my case it was written russian because my mom was russian but it didn't save me because that was my dad's last name and so so anyway this was a the toughest experience that i had up up until that point and there was these two people who came into the room where i was the only undesirable all other kids were being questioned by other examiners but they told me that we cannot question you we are waiting for special examiners so i was like oh something's afoot and so these two guys came and it's for four hours basically and were asking me questions which were not in the program and so on but i know i was a kid i was sixteen years old i tried to answer the best i can but it was a setup it's been documented since then there are even lists of problems that were given to undesirables in those days in my year no no jewish applicants as far as i know jewish by this metric mhmm were accepted so then i had to go to this there was one school technical school in moscow for which was the institute for oil and gas exploration which had a applied mathematics program and that's where many me and and many of my many of the kids who were not accepted to moscow university ended up and so but the point is so and then i was i was so motivated by this because i wanted to show those guys you know that within five years less than five years i i got a letter from the president of harvard university inviting me as a visiting professor to harvard i was twenty one i was barely twenty one because i already did some research in the meantime that's how motivated i was you know so but the interesting aspect of it is that for for for the longest time afterwards i was telling myself a story that nothing really happened it wasn't so bad okay so i was failed but i knew that i was going to succeed it was thirty years later that i finally got to meet that boy that sixteen year old that i that i neglected this time and i realized that he died that it was a crushing blow the innocence not just innocence because there was no way it looked like there was no way i could become a mathematician because if i don't if they don't accept me there it's over mhmm i didn't know that i could actually find this striving applied math program and then eventually somebody would take me under his wing and so on and then could move to united states that was not in the realm of possibilities so in other words i could there was nothing to look forward to it was clear that it's over i cannot i cannot do what i love and so when i finally when i finally connected to that boy oh my god i was a totally different experience all the pain and all the trauma came to the surface and it was a kind of a tsunami i didn't i wasn't sure i would survive this it's so it was so hard and what happened was i was invited to to give a talk about this in new york it was kind of a spoken word event about science but like personal experiences related to science this was almost a year after my book came out in my book one of the first chapters is a chapter about this experience but what i realize now is that i wrote it from the third person perspective i knew the facts but i was not emotionally connected to that experience however since i wanted to write the book and to connect to my readers i allowed the boy to write it so a lot of people were touched by it and they would people would say wow that chapter you know it really got a lot of resonance it was translated into the language even before the book was published i was surprised by this because i didn't know yet so the adult edward was not yet in touch but the book gave the outlet to the child so and that kind of started the process so finally almost a year later i'm i'm in new york in this this event and the night before i'm in my hotel room and and i was like okay what am i going to talk about tomorrow and i take a piece of paper just to you know my usual like preparation you know for things yeah and then suddenly i have this vision that i will walk up to the microphone tomorrow and i will just start crying and i was like by that time i already had an insight that it's possible to have that kind of a splitting kind of dissociation i was like but if things were happening quickly there was someone in my life who explained to me this idea that some things are under the radar of of awareness but they may still influence you and a lot of that could be connected to some experiences in your childhood so i was kind of ready for it from different angles but i was so surprised because i was like what is there to remember i know i know everything so then my inner voice says alright then you have nothing to worry about they'll go tomorrow and you will speak about this and if you start crying it's not a problem i was like no i don't want to cry in front of people i want to find out what it is what happened and i sat under my bed closed my eyes and it came so it's hard to describe so this is what the and the sheer energy of it and how much effort it took to suppress it actually for all these years how much effort it took to build that i wouldn't say in russian you know that that hardcore you know around myself yeah so that and the thing later i realized there were moments when it could come out and for instance i developed this fear of public speaking there are all kinds of little things that i now feel more connected so anyway i saw what happened now through the eyes of that child i saw how how difficult it was how crushed he was and it looked completely hopeless and i felt like what's the point of living now for me now that i know how cruel this world is which i didn't realize before because i prefer to wear this pink you know the the the rose the rose colored glasses but then something happened it's so strange it's like you feel that inside of you there is this dead child and it is incredibly sad i mean it's like i can't even describe it but suddenly he comes alive and suddenly it's like oh he's here and i and i had a little talk with him and i said look you know i know and i went to thank you i'm so sorry that i neglected you for so long you know i didn't know thank you for doing this and it's almost like you know i felt like the image came to mind is like a fallen soldier like you leave a fallen soldier on the battlefield a wounded soldier and then you come back to take him with you and and i said but look look what we have done look at us now it was not in vain we are doing okay and it's kind of almost just like holding holding holding that child and that that sense of who i am you know and feeling it so the next day i went to the microphone and i let him speak for the first time about his experience in his own voice it was incredible people were crying and afterwards came up to me and start sharing stories and so on because it is a story it's universal story it's archetypal story it's the story of rejection and being treated unfairly we all know it and i think it's so important to realize that it's so it's possible to revisit those moments it's possible to reconnect to our little ones it's possible to bring them back and we are better for it because this changed my life this experience then there were other then suddenly it's like a floodgates there were many other things that came that's when i became interested in the dimensions of imagination and intuition and so on because suddenly i realized that i was deprived of those of that possibility of looking at the world through the eyes of a child because that child was frozen in time he was not i was not connected to him but suddenly he's with me and he's like almost like opens his doors and says look at look look at this look at this so if i could ask you about there's a difficult idea here there's a tension i've interacted with a few folks in my personal life and in general that have lived through this experience of unfairness and cruelty in the world as young people and what wisdom do you draw from the the the the action you took of not acknowledging that you're a victim to cruelty but instead just working your ass off working harder and then this the flip side of that is you eventually reconnecting with the cruelty that you experienced because if you did that early on i was not ready for it it is a defense mechanism i do i could be cry i could have come you know there were kids who commit suicide after this experience i could have commit suicide because it's too much and it is well known afterwards of course i became aware of all the literature about childhood trauma and so on and i've been i've been speaking publicly about it since then too and so you know it is well known issue and well known kind of universal phenomenon i think that interesting enough even though now i see a lot of discussion of it now that my eyes are open but somehow before i didn't see it so that which also shows you how our our confirmation bias kind of like how we screen ourselves how we turn a blind eye to things which do not confirm our views or for for which we are not yet ready and by the way nobody should push to do it too soon i'm glad i i developed certain fort certain strength i was confident i was strong to withstand this and if i weren't who knows how it could turn out so it is a very subtle kind of alchemical process which i don't think there is a recipe there's a formula the reason i'm talking about this is just to share this experience because i think that the only thing we can do in this in some sense is to share with each other because then we can find for instance if somebody shared with me it it would naturally lead me maybe to get closer to that to to kind of understanding it's really just personal stories it's not obviously there is a there is a component where professionals could be involved professional therapist and so on in my case it somehow happened miraculously well i did have support but not not from professional psych therapists but from like dear friends so i did i did have you didn't you do need i had somebody at the time who basically held my hand and through this experience yes it was invaluable and it could not be done otherwise so i think it's very common and here's the thing i would not do it any any other way when you when i reconnected and i saw all the horrors and so on but i also was able to see that my examiners were victims of their own situation that they became they fell for this bogus theories or maybe it was more of a issue of career advancement or something and i was realized they must have suffered as well because they must have had some kind of consciousness of conscience about it that acting this way towards sort of basically kids you know so it's not a it wasn't pretty from their point of view so i i could forgive them and i could like also appreciate what a what a boost of energy it gave me yeah if i was accepted and i was just well i was a first year student i lived i would live in a dorm because i was in the you know i'd be probably partying and drinking and who knows what maybe i wouldn't even become a mathematician but this focused me like a laser without me even thinking about it it just happened i just i couldn't do i didn't care about anything but doing mathematics and it paid off you know it changed my life so was it good or bad paradox seems like life is full of those you said you lost your father four years ago yeah what have you learned about life from your dad that's another another big one yeah because i was very close to him and it was tough it was tough and i was not i was sort of not ready for it because up until that point i lived pretending that death does not exist when my grandparents died i was already in the us so it was very convenient and i couldn't go back so i i grieved but it kind of was a bit abstract for me i didn't see their dead bodies you know i didn't bury them and so on so i waited till the so my the first death in my life was my father like of really close loved ones and i was absolutely devastated you know he was such an amazing creature such an amazing human being he was the kindest the smartest the most funny just he's really funny and just really fun to be with you know this is what i miss obviously i mean i would just love to hang out with him so and then suddenly he's not there so it's tough but it kind of changed my perspective you miss him i miss him tremendously i miss him tremendously but i in a way i learned that he never left me in some i mean it sounds so words are so you know like they are they cannot you cannot express in words this what i'm trying to say but do you carry him with you yeah but and i in some sense i always did and and i i i saw that that it's always been it was really we were one in some sense you know like we were but there was this experience of two two people being together and that i miss tremendously but he gave me so much and i you know let let me tell you one aspect of it for instance when he was a kid his father was sent to gulag on bogus pretenses right so he when he was sixteen he applied to a university he wanted to become a theoretical physicist by the way my love for theoretical physics was to a large extent because of that and he was not accepted even though he was brilliant because he was the son of the enemy of the people and he kind of broke him this experience that he didn't care when he was you know he went to a technical school and he didn't really care that's my take on it and then he ended up in this in this in this little provincial town and he thought he would escape from it as soon as possible and then he met my mother and he fell in love and so i am sort of the product the product of that you know of physics but then what i learned is that because he was not able to overcome that specific experience it fell to me to do it and if i didn't my son or my daughter would have i think that that was one of the things i learned that it was not by chance that about the same age for slightly different reasons i was subjected to the same kind of unfairness and cruelty and i in some ways i i feel like i did it for him also i always because he was also always so proud of me i was so happy and i was i had this tremendous gift twice i was invited by american mathematical society to give this big lectures twice it was in two thousand twelve and in two thousand eighteen and both times they were in boston it could anywhere in the us mhmm both times was in boston walking distance from my parents' place so he could be there and my mom as well mhmm and that was such a gift that he was beaming you know like seeing me on the stage so you know now that he's no longer here and it's just you well i can still have my mom i still have my sister yeah but as a man yeah there's some aspect that it's that it does hit you hard are you afraid of your own death do you think about your death are you afraid of it i have a certain conceptual view of life and death today which is informed by my experiences in particular going through my father's death and that is something which cannot be conceptualized like that experience like you cannot give it to somebody one thing i will say is that i felt that what it was it was actually love totally exposed like naked and you try to throw it is so acute so being facing that love is incredibly painful because it's so intense when the person is alive we are we have conversation we have wars we have some actions we have some stuff is going on and it puts a filter so you we rarely actually feel love in this totally completely pure unadulterated state but when person dies it's there and it's staring at you and no matter what you do you cannot turn away like i tried to it's like almost i felt like i want to throw a blanket over it yeah it burns like immediately like boom gone it's there live through it and i was i kept saying to myself just live through it live through it that's how you and that's how you know also learn what is love for example what is it really what is love what is life also because i was completely i had no idea and and then you kinda learn that okay so maybe it's not quite there's more to eat there more there is more to eat there's more to this experience than what can be put in a concept or in a in a in a sentence in a in a maybe poetry or music can do some justice to it but if so then my own life has that component has that dimension which is beyond anything i can say about it you know and even though i love this being this playing this role i love it and i kind of i kind of makes me feel different about all kinds of difficulties that arise because it's almost like i want to enjoy it because that's what being human is it's being it's being terrified it's being frustrated it's being self loathing sometimes it's not knowing but also being joyful mhmm and just like let's just enjoy it kind of all of it like that's why you came here for in some sense you know it's like not trying to run away from things but kind of trying to just live through them and appreciate so the biggest thing is gratitude in some sense it's just gratitude so thank you for letting me play yeah it's gratitude for every single moment even if it's dark even if it's a loss you have to have everything people around me they all say that it's total doom and gloom and the world is ending and i'm like first of all that's how you see it okay that's not the only point of view but also even if it is like that's your challenge like what are you going to do about it stop complaining about other people do something yourself how can you make it a better world you know and i think all of that starts with just a gratitude for the moment to to be able to play this game yeah how beautiful it is what we've talked about love but let me ask what role does love play in this whole game in the human condition it's like the glue you know it's like for me it's like that it's and it's not because people say love is like for human being like a romantic love yeah which is huge component of it obviously because it's so so beautiful to be able to to express it in this way but it could be love for what what you do for your passion for something you know and or or love for for your for your friends for instance or love it doesn't have to be and so in some sense that's that's what it's all about in the ultimate because living without love it's kind of bland boring and so and i would think it's possible for science to explain exactly what it is you can do evolutionary biology perspective you can talk about some kind of sociology perspective psychology perspective but the experience the intensity where you forget or time where reminded becomes an illusion yeah and everything just freezes oh my god and then it's kind of beautiful and painful to hear you say that when you've experienced love the deepest is when you lost it yes but in a sense you can say that you could not have one without the other i could not have that deep connection with my father like really on so so many levels if there weren't a moment that's how i see it and i'm not trying to say that's how everybody should should see for instance i respect ray kurzweil i respect and i feel and i almost like i get i i feel good bumps right now yeah i feel that desire to reconnect even if it is in the form of a you know a computer program let's be honest about it i find it to be very moving i find it very moving and i understand because he actually didn't have a chance to spend much time you know i think he was sixteen or seventeen when he's he was a teenager his dad died i was lucky because my father died i was much older i've had so many moments with him but that's not my thing like i think it is a feature it's not a bug and it sounds crazy like i would love i would give anything to have him here right now right now everything i have i give it away right now yeah where do i sign yeah just see him for one hour i promise you i will but i also know that i will then i'll still lose him or i will die or whatever you know so that thing so what is why is it so worse to just hold hold on to holding on to it why why are we holding on to this and i am the first sucker i'm the first man to hold on but i'm questioning it now like is there another way to approach life where you just you know how buddha is like just let it go enjoy and let it go enjoy and let it go is it possible accept the paradox of it well ask me in a couple of years you know i will report but i think that it's but to my mathematical mind it sounds like a very interesting idea to be honest because to me the idea of holding is an sounds like an impasse because no matter in all my experience and if you look in history every time somebody's holding you know it's how they said in the matrix whatever has a beginning has an end it's like you cannot go around it if you have a beginning you could have an end so then might as well just enjoy it and not worry too much about extending it longer that's how i see it now but maybe tomorrow will be something else you know yeah the roller coaster of life the paradox of life right edward you're an incredible human being i've been a fan for a long time thank you for writing love and math thank you thank you for being who you are being both one of the greatest living mathematicians and still childlike wonder of the exploring the how this whole world works the the nature of the universe and thank you so much for speaking with me today this is amazing been a pleasure thank you thanks for listening to this conversation with edward frankel to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from sofia kovalevskaya a russian mathematician it is impossible to be a mathematician without being a poet in the soul thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
