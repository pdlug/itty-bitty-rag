the following is a conversation with simone giertz an inventor designer engineer and roboticist famous for a combination of humor and brilliant creative design in the systems and products she creates including as part of her new product design company called yech she has a popular youtube channel where she has demonstrated a lot of her incredible and fun designs and inventions from quote shitty robots to a tesla model three converted into a truck but where she also revealed her personal journey after having been diagnosed with a brain tumor simone is a brilliant fun and inspiring human being it was truly an honor for me to get to meet her and to have this chat and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this podcast we got master class for learning insight tracker for biological data and athletic greens for my daily multivitamin choose wisely my friends also if you want to work with our amazing team we're always hiring go to alex freeman dot com slash hiring and now onto the full ad reads as always no ads in the middle i try to make this interesting but if you must skip them please still check out our sponsors i love their stuff and maybe you will too this show speaking of love is brought to you by masterclass one hundred and eighty bucks a year gets you an all access pass to watch courses from the best people in the world at their respective disciplines the list is so long and it's amazing exploration of all the humanity's able to create you know when i ask about the meaning of life to me at the core it's love but the way that love manifests itself in the human condition in society i think at this moment i can try to express as a creation of beauty of increasing the amount of beauty in the world of celebrating of noticing of admiring and of creating beauty and the mastery of a particular discipline i think is one of the best ways to create that beauty so the best people in the world doing a thing and teaching you how to do it or even just talking through how to do it it's not always the big advice but the little details and you notice the genius of these people in the details in the way they see the world in the way they care themselves in the way they start and end a thought in the way they start and end a sentence in the way they look in the way they move their hands in the way they think in the way they hope in the way they fear this is why it's good to learn from the best people in the world get unlimited access to every master class and get fifteen percent off an annual membership at master class dot com slash lex this show is also brought to you by insidetracker a service i use to track biological data that comes from my body to give me recommendations on what the heck i should be doing with my life i'm happy to report if you cared that most markers for me are looking pretty good the only small exceptions i think reveal themselves in just the tremendous amount of stress i've been under over the past year and i think stress or not many of you listening to this are going through a rough time for reasons that are hard to explain and for reasons that are obvious the human mind can experience some deep moments or deep days and weeks and months of loneliness for reasons that make no sense to the outside world but it's still real to the human mind and of course our life is such that we experience a lot of loss a lot of struggle a lot of pain and suffering and through that it's more obvious that the mind can be in turmoil and and suffer and feel lonely and feel hopelessly lost in this world and i think through all of that the least you could do is to honor this life you're given this moment this chance you're given no matter how hard it is by taking care of yourself mentally physically it sounds silly to say but sometimes a nap sometimes a shower sometimes a healthy meal and maybe a walk a brisk walk or run can make the difference between a mind that's really struggling and a mind that at least sees a light at the end of the tunnel so take care of yourself we need you here get special savings for a limited time when you go to inside tracker dot com slash lex this show is also brought to you by athletic greens and this ag one drink that i just consumed and everything enjoyed i put it in the refrigerator to make it cold i don't know why i've been into that recently it's an all in one daily drink and i drink twice a day now that has all the multivitamins make sure i'll get all the healthy stuff in there you can read up about it the point is you don't have to worry about all the vitamins and minerals you're supposed to get because athletic greens takes care of all that for you for me it's a little bit of home in a bottle i make the drink and even when i'm traveling i feel i feel grounded all the turmoil all the madness going on in the outside world there's something at least i can rely on a little bit of habit i do the same thing with meditation i wake up every morning and repeat a mantra to myself and most evenings before bed unless i'm really struggling i'll repeat a mantra and it's a kind of meditative process so that to me no matter where i am feels like home because home is a place you live in inside your mind but little triggers positive triggers like drinking an athletic greens drink is very much that for me all of a sudden i'm transformed into this place into this feeling of home they'll give you a free one year supply of vitamin d and five free travel packs with your first purchase when you go to athletic greens dot com slash lex this is a lex fridman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's simone giertz what was the first cool thing you built where you fell in love with the process of making stuff you know i think in the beginning of building stuff you you run into the limitations of your skills so much so i feel like honestly building gets less and less frustrating where like i love it more and more the more i know so the limitations aren't fun like when is the frustration are fun but it's like when you have an idea of something and you wanna make it a certain level and then you just have to compromise with the materials and the tools and the skills you have so i can't remember first time where i felt like i'm proud of this wow this was so smooth i'm so proud of it like i feel like a lot of people i watch them build stuff and it's just like watching water pour down you know it's just like so easy and for me it's just like trying to shove a toy car into a wall so you're not able to step back and marvel like at the early creations even like even like we're not even talking arduino stuff even before then i'm from sweden and you have to choose either sewing or woodworking and i chose like woodworking in middle school and i remember the sense of pride when i got to bring something home and that thing of like oh my god i get to show my parents this and i think that is kind of the feeling that i've built my job around it's like the sense of pride and wanting to show people something that i made and like back then it was like a little wooden spoon you know and now it's a slightly larger wooden spoon wooden spoon yeah that is dynamic and moves and has an a mind of its own you first started doing more engineering type stuff with arduino boards at punch dude design which is an sf engineering firm what are just from your memory there what are some cool things you built there so the thing is i i went to advertising school and i just like a vocational studies a year and i realized there that i didn't care much for advertising but i thought it was really fun to build stuff and program so like i just completely focused on that and there i built my first hardware project or like electronics project which was this iphone case with retractable guitar strings yeah so basically i imagine that you could like pull out guitar strings from the bottom of your iphone and you could pluck it to your belt and then you could hold a cord on the screen and i built that together with my friend jonathan and i was like oh this is dope i thought it was so much fun and i considered like oh should i go to school for this but then i thought maybe i can get a job and i could get paid to learn about electronics so just based off of that one project i got the job at punch through design or it's actually was it was one year internship can you explain what we're talking about here so it's a case mhmm with guitar strings attached to it does it actually work at all it does these are not on the screen guitar strings no they're actual so they're actual strings that you pull out so there's a mechanism that's almost like a seat belt mechanism and yeah you pull them out from the bottom of your phone and you can attach them to your belt i mean it's terrible there's a few different ways to decide if somebody's touching a guitar string mhmm and what you do in a real guitar is you have the the little it's like measuring the vibration or the change in the as as the yeah you're measuring how the guitar is vibrating and you can't really do that because i can't have a a a receiving sensor because the guitar strings are gonna move in relationship to that because you don't have like a rigid neck and this is like yeah this was my first electronics project i was a little fledgling baby maker but what i decided was to use capacitive touch because that is independent on if the guitar strings are moving in relationship to something or in relation to something so basically there was just this little bluetooth arduino board that this company punch through design made so that was how i found them and i measured the capacitive touch so like whenever the guitar string was measured there was this little microcontroller that was like oh my god a guitar string got measured or touched and then that sent a signal over bluetooth to my phone and i'd built a little iphone app that interpreted those bluetooth signals and then checked what type of cord i was holding on the screen and then play the coherence so you're holding the cords on the screen screen so you're doing the multi touch sensing there mhmm that's incredible i honestly cannot believe that i pulled it off because i i think i was i was ignorance was definitely bliss because that was like yeah the first hardware project i'd ever built the first iphone app i'd ever programmed and like now if somebody was like hey i want this to be my first project i would probably be like oh that's a lot but i'm well it can be off because that's a that's such an interesting thing for people to hear because it's your first project and a lot of people stop because of the difficulty of their first project they never truly discover their own genius because they stop at the first and you didn't stop so it'd be interesting to kinda psychoanalyze you on the couch of why you didn't stop because you have to build an app yeah to figure out how to did you know how to program much or no okay i mean a little bit but i never programmed in or done any ios apps okay so you have to figure out how to get forget like what the app does just get the app running and working mhmm and then you have to figure out how to get the sensors in like real time the finger touching and you have to connect how to get the the capacitors touch working with the microcontrollers mhmm do you know anything about the capacitor touch sensors at that time i mean it's pretty easy now it's basically everything's easy yeah you know rockets are pretty easy you sound like my grandma she's i have an italian grandma and i'm always trying to get her we're like trying to get her to tell her recipes and every recipe starts with it's very simple yeah and then there's like forty five minutes of her explaining it it's like with gymnastics at the olympics they make it look easy the best people in the world always make the the the impossible seem easy i pride myself with making building some look really hard because i feel like i'm always struggling so much you make the easy seem impossible yeah no but yes so how many strings was it because it's just oh gosh i mean this is such a long time but no it was six oh six strings and you could touch it and then there's wow and it can and then the the phone itself makes a sound uh-huh and i still i still think it's such a cool concept to have this like mobile i'm not even a guitar player i don't know i was i mean i got the idea because i was kind of strumming on my charge cord of my phone oh like an air guitar but on a cord yeah but i i've been thinking about it because i'm like oh man it would be really fun to go back to that project with what i know now but the problem with it is that when you're producing the tension in your string just with your arm like you can't make it taught enough to actually play like it kinda becomes playing these like saggy strings yep so it's you're not really getting that experience and i think that's why i mean i yeah i haven't really pursued it if there's a way to generate the tightness from the case itself is it a device that unfolds and then with some kinda tightening mechanisms tightness but then it kinda becomes this like whole thing in a good car then it just becomes a really shitty guitar yeah like which this is a really shitty guitar but it's also but it's so shitty it's awesome yeah i don't know but it's a cool it's cool that you have an interface between a device that's capable of incredible computational power and an actual hardware thing mhmm is there something that you can psychoanalyze that made you finish that others could hear in in their own struggle to do their first project like that because you were not you were a nonengineering person technically and you did a pretty cool renegade out there wild no instructions engineering project no it's definitely it was an off road build where it's like if you're building a lego kit it's very much on the road and you're following instructions and this is like you have no idea if you're headed for a cliff or a dead end or you're gonna get stuck i think it had an natural pressure to it because it was a school project yeah so it did have deadlines built into it and and stuff like that so that definitely helped but i think also it was just so incredibly motivating when i realized that i might be able to pull it off yeah like that was i i felt like a bloodhound you know you're just like oh my god i can actually make this happen and i think if i hadn't seen that the horizon it would have been harder to stick through were you able to see the end of the tunnel pretty early on no not really i mean i feel like you're so there's somebody that's just suffering for a while i don't know how how your brain works but it's like if i have a problem i can't stop thinking about it like it's so fun to think about it like i spent i spent two and a half years designing a coat hanger and i just can't stop thinking about it like i get so into it because i think it's so much fun take me to this two year journey of the coat hanger of the coat hanger what i'm like how did it begin how did it begin it began with a corner in my home where i couldn't fit a coat rack the thing is i shouldn't have brought this up because i'm gonna release it as a product probably in a year on an actual product mhmm okay well that's a trick view it as a mystery it's a mystery yeah but it's it solves a fundamental problem in in the human condition and i am so excited about it and i cannot i don't yeah but this is i get so pumped about it because i see it's just this issue or like this problem that i wanna solve and i i kinda can't put it to rest until i have it's i mean speaking of cone hangers doorknobs have always been interesting to me it's cool how how there's things that everybody uses that somebody designed lex yeah oh my god so okay so this is i so i've i've two like big so basically i started on youtube and i'm been doing that for like the last seven or eight years and i've kind of been thinking of like okay what's next for me because i wanna keep on trying out new things and i'm i'm i'm kind of going into two different avenues one is the product business that i started codehingeers tbd and then i am working on a pilot episode of a show where each episode is about an everyday object like eating implement of the west why are we ruled by an iron fork how did that happen in every everyday object that you have and that you just take for granted somebody just made it up yeah well sheep well keep using it yeah even if it's not opt i mean presumably most objects are optimal you hope or at least a local option yeah and that's what i think is so like the world around us and this is why i love building things is because it just opens up this idea that the world around us is so malleable mhmm and you can make objects work for you better like i spent i i made this fruit bowl i had a fruit bowl and i was always annoyed that i had either too little or too much fruit for it so i made a fruit bowl where i can change the diameter of it it has a mechanism so you can like make it bigger or smaller and that's just like the thing of being like bowls why are they the way that they are i could make them different and i think like i want to make an episode about doorknobs i think it's so interesting why are they the way they are why are they placed the way where they are i i think that's going to be a rabbit hole from which you will never return i would happily live in that rabbit hole forever like if i could if i could like dig out a little niche for myself there because i think it's like you know they go so deep they're also on different sides of doors you never like the push pull situation mhmm on doors in general like that's one of the main problems of humanity is figuring out the push pull you hang out which that is embarrassing it's yeah just okay how many there's eight billion peoples on people on earth every single second there is millions of people being embarrassed by the confusion of what they're going to do stats right now there's somebody some guy first time in college is trying to be impressive to everybody to push his on a mhmm and he plays it off like it's cool ocean i i knew that no but that's and it affects our behaviors that was why i think it's so interesting with forks is that forks actually affect our eating behaviors mhmm and they can get you to eat faster or slower take bigger bites or smaller bites and there are all these ways or like the social i mean the reason that chopsticks work is because they do the food chopping in kitchen rather than on the plate and also you have a bowl that you bring to your mouth with whereas a plate you keep on the like there are just all these ways in these objects affect our behavior opening and closing doors and i think it's such an interesting take on culture through and like human behavior through these objects that we use every day and we never question them really yeah and then there's institutions that are controlling our mind that don't want us to know the truth why are sporks not more popular have you asked yourself that question no it's all big utensil is behind all of it alright so i mean in those early days did you suffer from imposter syndrome like the that leap to being an engineer was was there especially when you started working on points to the design on a team of engineers was there insecurity both yes and no i think i've i always try to flip my flaws into selling points and for that so getting that job i i was like oh you're a team of engineers everybody working here is an engineer your customers are not all engineers you need somebody who can be your filter and tell you when something's gonna be too hard for your customers to understand so it was more me being like oh no it might seem that me not having skills is a bad thing but actually it's a great thing i need it i represent the everyday person i understand deeply yeah deeply what everybody needs and wants yeah yes that is me the representation of the of the average human but i mean i i remember that so i studied physics for a year in college and then i dropped out and i had this rule for myself that whenever i did not understand any something i would ask a question so i was always raising my hand in class and it's this room entire like auditorium filled with incredibly intelligent people who are mortified of seeming stupid yeah and i think that was really like and i remember people at the end of the year coming up to me being like thank you so much for all the questions you asked because whenever there was something that i was too scared to ask you always raised your hand so i think it is a bit of a skill and i think that is kind of how i channel my imposter syndrome is i'm just like nope let's lay it all out there so you're okay being almost like self deprecating just coming off i mean i'm definitely that i i kinda lean into i call myself an idiot i lean into being stupid i think not all heroes wear capes and the guy and girl who asks the stupid question is everybody's hero i think including the teachers yeah i think it's it's both it's a double edged sword i started out on the internet kind of i kinda got the moniker the queen of shitty robots because i posted a lot of stuff on slash r slash shitty robots on reddit and people started calling me the queen of slash r slash shitty robots and then the slash r kind of dropped so what i'm trying to say is i did not come up with that with myself but i did happily adopt it so i definitely came from a place of like building things that didn't work and kind of yeah everything going wrong every time like happily failing and i think that was amazing it was a really powerful tool for me to like not get my perfectionism in the way because if i set out to do but what i've realized now is there was also a defense mechanism being self deprecating is like always beating people to the punch it kind of was a survival tactic on the internet of being like never daring to set out as an expert and i still do that like i'm terrified to tell people how to do something even if i know because it kind of opens you up for being shot down so i think i have i definitely have a conflicted relationship with it and now especially as i'm i'm getting older i am more skilled than i was before i mean i'm a ceo of three businesses and i'm like i don't need to like keep on talking myself down all the time so yeah i think it's definitely something that has served me really really well and that is still like a thing that i have in my work life and in my relationships but i'm also trying to only do it when it's beneficial to me and not when it's harmful yeah i mean but when you're as successful as you are i feel like people like it when you're self deprecating you don't take yourself seriously you have that humility i think it's probably the hardest when you're starting out yeah because i don't know i think it was easier than almost i don't know but nobody takes you seriously right when you're starting out when you're young like you know i just realized that i played a lot more stupid than i was and i think it's also oh gosh i can't believe i'm the one bringing this up but like being a woman in a male dominated field and you're like try i was just trying to make myself the least amount threatening or like really unthreatening because people are threatened by you in different ways and it's like you have such a thin line that you can walk where you're like okay i need to be just attractive enough for people to not be offended by my appearance but just unattractive enough for people to not sexualize me i have to be just smart and witty enough for people to be like oh my god that's really cool but also shoot myself down enough for other people not to be able to do it or be like oh yeah watch this woman try to thinking that she knows how to build electronics you know so it's like that's a interesting skill to build especially when you put yourself out there on the internet yeah like unfortunately that's the reality of the internet and it's a skill you have to kinda develop and it's actually why a lot of really brilliant people avoid the internet yeah like there's not many peep like at mit for example there's not many brilliant professors or phd students and so on just putting their stuff out there because like if they what like if they really put their heart and soul into a thing first of all that's really hard mhmm and nobody nobody sees it and then everyone's like this is boring so there's so many failure modes like this is boring or like like you said you're coming off as too much of an expert you're not self deprecating enough mhmm but there's just so many failure modes and it's terrifying for people but i feel like that's a skill you should learn because most people like at mit at university and so on are doing a lot of awesome stuff yeah and you should show it off but i feel like you figured out a really good process of of showing it off if when you fail when you succeed all of it not taking yourself too seriously but also revealing through the humor and the self deprecation a kind of genius a kind of intelligence and curiosity yeah i just wanna snapshot that quote and put it on my linkedin the profile and the back of my autobiography coming out never i you don't wanna say that because like a year from now oh gosh i don't wanna i don't wanna shit on autobiographies yeah no no but even no just by saying that i'm shitting on autobiographies i just me being interested enough in somebody to wanna read six hundred pages about them talking about themselves is a no well well that's exactly the kind of person that should write one but also i'm fucking thirty two years old what do i have to write about like i went through puberty i lost my virginity and here we are like i don't know it's like such a three chapters it's a it's a coloring book chapter seven i learned to tie my own shoelaces i feel like it would be awesome anyway what's the the queen so how did you achieve the status of royalty the queen of shitty robots what's the origin story there i've i mean i have officially renounced my title now can you still speak of the time when you let i can still speak of the time your kingdom yes no i mean it started on because i did you rule by love or fear by fear of rejection from me the people who want to reject me so i yeah i started making these little gifs like my the early projects that i did were very gif forward it was always like i only did it because it could be translated into a gift gift forward i like it yeah but honestly it was like it's a really good mental exercise to vet if your project is easy enough to be explained by like a seven second looping video without audio and because like nobody's gonna care that it also has bluetooth yeah like it's really like is it is it self explanatory enough to be explained through a gif so yeah just pause i'm sorry to interrupt but no go for it feel like all scientific papers and projects should go through that exercise can you please explain us again yeah actually deepmind does a good job of this like you know this we saw protein folding here's a gif mhmm that's literally what they do yeah because who's gonna read the nature paper mhmm so like this you have to like how do we communicate this visually in a sexy clean way where people can intuitively understand even if you don't know what a protein is even if you don't know what protein folding is yeah it's two x two very like yeah if somebody comes out of context and that's been really interesting also like building this product business and trying to do the marketing around that and i'm like somebody comes in and they have no idea about what this product is will they get it explained to them in this ad and i don't i don't know but it's definitely a worthwhile exercise to do so i started making these projects that got translated into gifs and i posted them on slash r slash shitty robots on reddit so that's how reddit existed yeah and i loved it i thought it was really fun and i was like i wanna contribute with content here you conquered it i don't i mean okay i don't know i was voted rejected i think i was voted top user of twenty fifteen so yeah that's an old merit for once you win a nobel prize you always have to know about it yeah okay so what was the first do you remember the early gifs that you created so this is when i was at punch through design in san francisco i was kind of building a lot of hardware projects for them but i also felt and they were so supportive of me but i also it's such a different way representing a brand versus representing yourself so there were some projects that i just like ruled out because i was like this feels too weird for this brand and i started building them on the side one of them was a toothbrush helmet and yeah so it's like a skateboard helmet with a robot arm on the forehead kind of like a unicorn horn mhmm and it pressures your teeth for you was that the first youtube video you uploaded it was the first gif that i uploaded so actually i wanted to i wanted to do a kids' show about electronics in sweden because i was like i love electronics i think it's fucking dope i could do a kids' show about it so i filmed this terrible terrible pilot episode mhmm in my bedroom in san francisco and that's when i built the toothbrush helmet and i emailed it to them i mean just cold emailed like i had no in or anything but i was like hey i wanna do this and they didn't get back to me nobody's surprised and i was like well i have this thing i built i might as well post it on the internet so that's why i made the little gif and i posted it on slash r slash thirty robots and i think it got like fifty thousand views and i was like wow and from there i just kept on building things and i think within six months it was my full time job can you go through the detailed design of this toothbrush helmet no there's a motor it's like a server like what what what's the motor what's the is an arduino involved yeah so i built it off of this robot arm called the me arm so it's just this acrylic robot arm and i guess three servo motors and it's all controlled by an arduino all the electronics already prebuilt it was a kit so i assembled it how do you make sure the the length of the arm is the proper i mean the arm came down so it's like yeah i mean i just programmed it to come down to my mouth and then poorly brush my front teeth yeah yeah and it was just swung back and forth i mean trial and error as i said error what was the challenges of that do you remember oh gosh or is that one not much of a struggle it's a challen no it was definitely a struggle because also how do you loop it with a get a nice gif i mean it loops it loops fine yeah it loops pretty fine yeah is that that's not that's not that hard no i mean it doesn't have to be perfect it's a gif it's the internet things are shitty all the time i think i mean i think the biggest struggle of that was that i had this intention for it to be this show and then them not giving oh yeah yeah giving back and i was like well if they don't want it then maybe youtube will have me they don't notice my genius yet what was what was so bad about the pilot do you remember what's like the worst most embarrassing so cringy yeah i mean it's thankfully not on the internet so nobody can find it but it's very much me being in what i called host mode which is where i'm like okay so what we're gonna learn today is that we're gonna look at this this is something called a servo motor and it's like the intonation and everything is really different and i'm actually i mean i thinking back of that i'm so happy that they didn't get back to me because it's such a different thing to kind of start your career in your living room running back and forth to the camera and like filming something and then looking at it and like i got to really find my own voice in a different way and then like a year later they offered me a show but then i was so off and running i was like no i don't wanna do this you didn't fall into that place of being like a actor like a youtuber where you're presenting a kind of personality you're more focused on the product you're creating i mean i think it's a combination of it i mean i i i think of it as acting sometimes but i only play the role of myself but of course it's like when you're shooting something for the seventh time yeah like you have to be able to muster that enthusiasm but no it's not i kind of think of everyday life me as a watered down version of the youtube version it's like that's a cheap knockoff yeah the quiz dot com version no it's just like add few hearts water if you have me but like on youtube it's just so condensed because you have jump cuts and you know like yeah i'll script jokes and make sure that everything lands and there's music and stuff and then like in real life you don't have any of that but it's still me what are some other cool robots in the early days that stand out to you i mean there's a million we can go through but like what may maybe what what was like a challenging one like a really challenging one in in the early days i mean i remember the breakfast robot which was my second project was a challenging one so is it eating cereal yeah it's a robot that like pours milk and cereal and feeds me at with a spoon i was mostly challenging because it was so like everything had to be in the right location and there were so many takes before i got everything right and by right i mean it makes an absolute mess yeah that one was challenging what takes was that one i don't know probably twelve ten something mess everywhere it was a mess and also i used like cheerios for the cereals in my it's shot in my old bedroom in san francisco and the floors were sticky for weeks afterwards do you guys should go into your autobiography yeah good it's nice which is we could just type out this podcast and i'll release it as a and my manager would be stoked we'll fix it in post yeah this the the feed because you have like a couple of feeding ones right there's soup isn't there a soup one yeah there's a soup robot there's a beer pouring robot yeah i mean that's that's awesome that's a difficult robotics problem in the shitty and the and the perfect version of having an arm that interacts intimately with a human being mhmm and one of the most intimate things you could do with a human being that's pg is defeat it i was like don't go there where where is he going with this oh my god he's a youtube comment come live like damn it so like to me there's a like feeding is tricky or even like getting a beer even pouring a beer is is tough into a glass yeah it's trickier than anyone who hasn't tried it thinks and even making it i think what i realized is that like making things really shitty or like failing in a spectacular way is also its own assertive skill because like the shittiest robot is the one that doesn't turn on right but like that isn't much to watch so it was always like wanting for it to fail in these kind of spectacular ways no there's a lot of stuff to be said about engineering in it is there something to be said on a philosophical level about the value of a flawed robot so like the kind of robots you want is to be partially flawed like do you think the kind of robots we'll have in the home mhmm that are friends and you know almost like pets wouldn't they need to be kinda shitty because we can love the somehow we humans love the shitty i mean it is kind of endearing and because i think it it kind of i'm gonna mess up this world word anthropomorphizes them mhmm i think it's i mean i never feel as deeply connected to my roomba as when it's like i'm on a cliff yeah i'm like babe have you had roombas talk village no i really yeah i've done that a lot yeah when they talk to you yeah and it and you immediately anthropomorphize them yeah and then you have if they have a name which is why most roboticists don't give names or gender to robots because you you become connected to them i'm of the opposite mind you should have like an in intimate relationship sounds weird but you should have a close connection to robots i mean there there's power in that there's a social element to robotics even an arm i don't know there's something about us humans that gain so much value from our interaction with dynamic objects and we should like lean into that as opposed to run away from it that was always the confusing thing to me about robotics is that most roboticists run away from that yeah weird because it's obviously gonna be robots are obviously going to be everywhere yeah obviously but it's also humans are sensitive and squishy and there's so much liability oh yeah yeah but the humans are sensitive and squishy when they interact with each other and they hurt each other all the time mhmm like sometimes they get together and they're like oh you're the best yeah no you're the best and then they leave each other and then they break each other's heart sorry about your breakup lex i i know what you're talking about get over this yeah i'm actually drunk for this interview haven't been able to sleep for nights i have not but from a safety protocol perspective people think about like physical damage not emotional damage i know this sounds ridiculous i know this sounds ridiculous but it won't be it's already happening there's an app called replica where people have an intimate relationship with an ai chatbot and they hurt themselves i was thinking about this yeah okay in dating mhmm what if you because you can drain like a chatbot to kinda mimic the way that you talk to people and interact with people go on yeah but then i'm like okay but what if we could all make ai versions of ourselves and have them date yeah like thousands of thousands of other ai people and have that as a way to churn out potential potential candidates like i feel like that's gonna be what's the what's the yeah what's the what what no but what's the point of like meeting twenty people if you're like oh but if we just had our ai versions of ourselves interact they'd be like oh your your method of conflict is not gonna match or what if the ai version of you like sleeps around with all the other ais and becomes famous for that and it starts this on onlyfans and then it become and you're like what did you do you come back home you'd realize like i don't i didn't want any a monster create a monster i mean do i get a cut exactly that's the question i would be asking but i think it's definitely like yeah the the human technology interaction is really interesting because i feel like i don't love any of the machines that i have in my life really you haven't you haven't i mean i don't love my phone i touch it all the time and it's there and it's like constantly it's a constant presence but there's nothing in me that feels like oh i love this object like i kind of despise it well that that might be the way you show love i don't know yeah that's deeper that's another psychoanalysis thing so you don't there's not robots whom you've taken apart that you miss no they're all terrible i mean i i have objects that i built that i love mhmm none of the robots i think but that's also because it was a different that was a different era where i wasn't really putting a lot of care into the projects i built so the more care you put into into the design to actually make it look to make it functional and look good that's where you put the love in yeah i mean it is it's like i feel like any technology company that figures out a way to get you to actually genuinely love your roomba or like love it in the way that you would love a pet there's a lot to be gained yeah and i think it's scary mhmm depending on who the company is mhmm because then they can manipulate you yeah if you if you love your roomba and all of a sudden your roomba starts telling you to buy stuff yeah or it's leaning to put lotion on jeff bezos' head yeah yeah i don't know where the lotion came in but yes maybe buy a certain thing i just i just imagine my amazon echo being like hey hey jeff bezos is really a great guy but even though you haven't do you think it's possible to fall in love with a robot yeah i mean people fall in love with things all the time well people have fallen in love with your shitty robots probably i i guarantee you there's people listening to this that are a little bit heartbroken saying that you've never fallen in love with your shitty robot they're like but i had a relation like i had an emotional connection to that robot like the one with the with the parent pats you on the back oh that one that one i do like i like that one a lot that's probably my favorite like shitty robot can you explain it so it's a machine it was my friend daniel beauchamp and i we had this long running joke about a proud parent machine that you could give a quarter and a pass you on the shoulder says proud of you yeah so yeah i still have that hanging on my wall in my workshop so that one i'm i'm i'm really happy with i just think it's a really funny concept and also i executed the build well so that was so it's an arm mhmm like what's the build yeah i built it off of an old lamp arm yeah basically it's just a motorized arm and this kind of torso of of a person mhmm was it so it's actually a hand right i thought it correctly it's it's like the laser cut it's just laser cut plywood and it kind of has like i it looks creepy yeah which i like yeah the creepy helps with the yeah and yeah it says proud of you son because i just thought that sounded more funny than proud of you daughter and also proud of you son just it immediately communicates that it's a parent it's not just like a colleague or something it's like proud of you yeah and it charges you a quarter for it yeah but he added like chat gpt on top of that and fine tune it on conversations you've had with your parents and all of a sudden you have a thing that can fundamentally transform your psyche yeah that's all it takes that's a beautiful creation how'd you come up with that creation oh it was my friend daniel and i who had a long running joke about it high level can you speak to your creative process i think a lot of it i mean it's changed for the shady robots that's exactly right robot yeah i mean it it has a lot of overlap so it's identifying everyday problems and in the shitty robot era i would kind of take an everyday problem like oh i have a hard time getting up in the morning and i would solve it in the most ridiculous spectacular way i could think of so for waking up in the morning it was having an alarm clock that slaps me in the face with a rubber hand mhmm and what i'm doing now is still identifying everyday problems but i'm actually trying to like product design my way out of it what in your experience was the funniest thing is it violence like the hands slapping you food eating is there is or is it just a case about that funniest is no i think it's more like the proud parent machine it's not violent it doesn't there's no nothing it's just emotional and it's kind of a commentary on this fraught relationship that we sometimes have with our parents and they're pride of us sometimes every time sometimes my dad visited like last week and he was like i just wanna say i'm so proud of you and for the built life you built for yourself and that was really sweet yeah it's really that on the back of my autobiography too yeah it's not your fault simone it's not your fault some stuff is my fault what was the longest one to complete for the shitty robots that you remember because you spent on a few of them you spent quite a long time which is also inspiring when you take so long in a project yeah i think kind of in the more like fun whimsical department rather than shitty robots i built recently this music box so like a small music box that kind of has a barrel mhmm with little spikes and it plays a song but i did a large version of that that pops a sheet of bubble wrap and then like plays tones into a pan flute so yeah you can actually program it to play different songs that one kicked my butt in so many creative ways and it was such a pain i think that is probably the like weird funny project that's taken me the longest and like the biggest engineering effort where's the sound coming from so if you it all came from me realizing that if you pop bubble wrap and you pop it right in front of the opening of a pan flute or like one of the pipes you can have it play different tones so that's what it does so i built this music instrument off of that okay if it's okay can you describe some some like how it works some of the the the technical details here yeah so fascinating basically i mean one of the big issues that i had so i worked with as of a year and a half back i hired an engineer stu so we were collaborating on it but a big issue that we had was feeding in the bubble wrap sheet and like making sure that it feeds them straight and doesn't get skewed because you need to make like the popping feet which is where you program this barrel to pop different bubbles need to be so perfectly aligned on the bubble of the bubble wrap for it to pop in the right location so there's a feeder for the bubble wrap that's a challenge and then you have to have a barrel with the little baby feet on it yeah that pops the bubble wrap that must be exciting that barrel was a pain yeah as well i had to get a like this rotary set up for my cnc and yeah it was it was a lot of work but that was really fun and it's just like this is probably my favorite privilege of my job is that i can go down any rabbit hole i think find interesting did you have a lot of joy from popping the mhmm the yeah that's fine the bubbles it's a lot of self soothing and like i got to spend self soothing i think i spent a week trying to figure out the best material to pop bubble wrap with because if you have two if you kind of put them to to through or through if you put a sheet of bubble wrap through two rigid tubes mhmm the air kind of just escapes from one side of the bubble into the other so what i realized was that if you have a squishy material like kind of a yoga mat material mhmm in between it it actually it prevents that and pops it a lot more reliably but like increasing the pop reliability was a huge effort as well you have to pop a squishy thing with another squishy thing because you don't need a lot of force yeah like you just need it to not the air to not be able to escape anywhere wow but then also we had there was different qualities of bubble wrap where there was a lot of transference between different bubbles so instead of the bubble popping it would just seep the air into a neighboring bubble and that like membrane would kind of so you know i i just like getting to spend weeks on weeks of just studying bubble wrap did you ever think about like publishing academic work on bubble wrap no wouldn't that be epic because nobody's done this i bet you nobody's done squishing it squishing material on squishy versus squishy or popping i bet somebody has but you know i i always i thought i was gonna go into academia like i was such an ambitious student i loved school i i actually applied to mit but then i pulled out because i was like no i don't wanna do it but now i realize it's really good that i didn't because i'm too much of a spaz too much of a spaz now i'm distracted i'm thinking there must be papers about when you have two bubbles yeah you would need to know the physics of two bubble when when you have two bubbles colliding one will pop first and there has to be good models of that but that's very that has to do with chemistry and whatever the the material the bulb was made from but then no there's materials in here there's got somebody must understand bubble wrap deeply like deeply so i'm just gonna take a quick restroom break because lex is on his own train now and i'm just gonna leave you to talk about bubble yeah actually don't need to go to the restroom yeah i'm gonna insert like a two hour instructional here with like a a blackboard where i it's the skill of a it know if i have that skill i just i love bubble first okay bubble on bubble interaction go so you you did mention at mit you went to college for physics for one year and you dropped out what do you learn from that who do you think should and shouldn't go to college i think first of all you shouldn't listen to me that should be the name of your autobiography first of all you shouldn't listen to me i you know i realized that i was there for the wrong reasons i had this deep i got completely like starting to get grades in school which in sweden at that time we started getting it at at eighth grade so when i was fourteen it just kind of hijacked my brain because i realized that i could put a number on how smart i was and i got obsessed with it and i wanted to study mechanical engineering because i was like i like machines but then physics was kind of the hardest thing you could do and i had this like deep need to prove to myself that i was smart so i started studying physics realized i wasn't that smart i realized or i mean just mostly that i like i love math but i don't love math ten hours a day yeah and also i think i am a generalist through and through like i'm decent at a fair amount of things but definitely not a specialist in any ways and this it was such a specialist type of area that i felt like the other parts of my brain kind of just dwindled and died so i think i think most of all if people are thinking about going to college especially if you're here in the states and it's so fucking expensive really okay there's two there's two things i wanna do one is like actually go to a workplace where people are doing the job mhmm that you think you wanna do if you wanna become a doctor like be at a hospital and like try to see how doctors work and if you actually like it because i feel like people have a lot of ideas of what it's gonna be like and just doesn't match with reality and then i think when people figure out what they wanna do there's kind of that's two separate questions or there's two questions that you could split out of that one is like what do you actually wanna do that for me for the last ten years is building stuff but then there's a second part to that question which is what context do you wanna do that do you wanna build stuff at a startup or at a big corporation do you wanna build stuff for an art gallery or for the movies or for youtube and i think that's often like people only learn how to answer the first question but then it's like the context means as much because i was building stuff that punched through design and i wasn't getting that like deep fulfillment like i felt like i wasn't fully using myself and like hitting all of my gears because i just wasn't that motivated about building stuff for other people and i changed the context and everything changed and so sometimes you do need to consider resume and stuff like that for depending on the but some i think people consider that way too much especially in modern times i feel like you don't need to go to college just for the resume i feel like the biggest benefit of college i mean there's a bunch but one is just do hard things mhmm but you could do hard things anywhere but some people need to be i was probably one of those people to be forced to do hard things and the other is to meet fascinating humans from all walks of life that are pursuing that have all kinds of different passions and allows you to learn depending on the major you can you can learn generally and you can search if you're doing it efficiently about what actually inspires you and the other thing is the the resume thing yeah but ultimately you don't need college to find your passion to run with it i mean i have so much college fomo though like i think it's i chose a different set of experiences and when i applied to mit i was i think i was twenty four because i was like oh maybe i should become an electrical engineer because i really liked electronics but then i remember seeing that the average age was eighteen and i was like oh fuck no i can't hang out or like be in a room filled with eighteen year olds who are smarter than me yeah so i think i definitely like missed the train on having that experience but at the same time i did so many other things and i chose other experiences and i wouldn't trade them but i still like i mean i'll go to on a campus and i'll be like oh yeah but i think it's also because i have a dreamy idea of what it is because i never had to do it in practice fully exactly it's the fomo yeah yeah a lot of people really struggle with that burden they'll they'll go it and doesn't matter how long you go through if you don't go all the way to the phd you a lot of people have the fomo it doesn't it's a silly silly little notion i think because i think you should be doing college or school until you find something that lights your heart aflame where you're like fuck yes i wanna do this yeah and run with it maybe you can you can find that in other context as well i've i've found it yeah but definitely yeah but it is a buffet of experiences that you can have what about what was the most fun robot to make or musical artistic creation where the process was the most fun they're all painful in different ways so pain yeah you find pain fun no but it's it definitely the pride of me getting to pull something off or like managing to pull something off even when it was really difficult is is very satisfying what was the difficult thing that you pulled off you were like yeah this is cool i like working on jigsaw puzzles but i don't like how much table space they take up because i like just have one big table where i can do it and that's also my dining table so i made this mechanical table where you can switch between two tabletops mhmm and that was an incredibly painful project and i'm really happy with the outcome and like so proud that i managed to pull it off how does this switch tabletops it's tambour mechanism so like tambour like you'll have them like old record player like it's these like thin slats of wood with fabric on the back and you can kind of get them to go around curves so basically one of the table tops or table surfaces is tambour and then there's a little crank and you can kind of roll it off to the side and it reveals another tabletop under it that you can lift up because it's on cams so you can switch between the two i think that one was both really difficult to pull off and it's also one of few projects that i use in my everyday life like i use it almost every day you know what a really cool one was that that was part of your ted talk where there's a rotating thing that you wear on your shoulders was that hard to make so for for people who haven't seen your ted talk they should of course but it's how would you describe this best joke if you put how would you call that device sorry i'm i don't even know i never used it beyond the ted talk really yeah but basically it's the shoulder rig and it has this like almost like saturn ring looking platform that goes around i can't even remember what the problem proposition was that i was trying to solve variety probably introducing variety to your life yeah maybe and this and an element of surprise because you can put popcorn as you did on it uh-huh and it goes around there's a little hand why is like a tiny hand funny i don't know but it just slams whatever is on that thing into your face yeah i don't know was that easy to make yeah that one's fine i can't there was i mean my ted talk was so yeah for one once again they cut out my best joke what was their best joke my best joke and they didn't even ask me about it it was so there's this whole lead up where i built a chopping machine so it's a machine that chops vegetables and it has two giant knives and it goes dunk dunk dunk dunk and it's kind of terrifying and i show a video of it and then it ends on this gif of it chopping up a banana and i'm kinda scrunching up my face being like ugh yeah and the whole reason i show that project is because i'm leading it up to the punchline of oh and as a bonus this gif right here is the perfect response if anyone ever sends you dick pics you don't want which brought down the house it does it every time and they cut it out without asking me because they were like oh but we wanted people to be able to show it in classrooms and i was like i have abandoned the hope of being shown in classrooms for years ago i think that's a good joke thank you that's a really that's a really good one so you're you're you're okay going sometimes a little bit edgy i mean i'm i'm i i say that i'm i'm crude and wholesome because i can be very crude but i also try really really hard to be a good person yeah and to like i'll say shit and fucking all that stuff which i don't even think is crude but yeah but i really really try to wield the power that i have in a thoughtful way so no i i i wouldn't call me edgy because i'm not i don't think it's edgy it's all like chopping a banana with knives and saying it's a good gift response to anyone that sends you dick pics is definitely not edgy you're correct yeah i think it's pretty it's just a funny joke yeah it's pretty funny i feel bad that ted cut that i i mean it's fine it's like it's a decision that i made really early on where i was like what i'm i think often people misinterpret what i'm doing as being for children which i think is part because like my projects were always really colorful and fun but i think it also has some sprinkles of sexism of being like oh it's a woman doing something she must be doing it for the children and i'm like yeah fuck the children i'm doing it for myself yeah good so i think i i would just really early on decided of like oh no i'm not gonna try to cater to that which like still i mean i get a lot of messages from parents being like can you please stop cussing in your videos and i'm also like i get it but also that is not what's gonna mess up your kids like i really try to be thoughtful and a decent enough role model but i'll also acknowledge that humans fuck yeah it's okay somehow that you being able to say the f you to the system what word word f what do it i can't i can't scared it it sounds better when you say f u it's it's it's it's a dance i should oh boy have you ever made a robot that dances with you no okay you need a dance partner so i get lonely sometimes yeah i i feel like that's the theme of this whole podcast yeah oh what's the most embarrassed you've ever been on your podcast so i i don't know if you've experienced this but i'm generally embarrassed by most things i say inside my head yeah so like when i say something like now it's it's just there's a voice inside my head that goes yeah like what you're a disappointment like that the parent petting in in the back the the the hand stops working yeah just slows down yeah and then there's an awkward silence you don't know what to say next that's really embarrassing usually and also i used to work as a journalist so i know how to sit with the silence and try to drag it out of you see what i did there you gave up you you pulled out i quit you're blank i'm sweating i quit literally sweating okay and also because you're in a full fucking suit what is that like how did that come about actually it was probably mit is because everybody was dressing in like sweatpants very chill wear mhmm and i was like i like taking everything seriously mhmm it just felt like a it it was my way of saying f u to the way things are because i like i always admire richard feynman i like it how there's like a classiness to it mhmm so i don't know if it's for visual purposes but it's just how i feel when i put on a suit it makes it makes me feel like i'm gonna take this really really seriously yeah and if i embarrass myself it's all my fault because i tried there's no excuse i tried a hundred percent the interesting thing about your ted talk to go to a dark topic is what happened when i walked off stage no what happened when you walked off stage found out that i had a brain tumor was that not where you're going there's something else dark about my yeah well yes i thought you knew through the ted talk you found out right after i mean the reason that i found out was partly because of the ted talk because my mom came into town to be there for it and my right eyelid was swollen and it had kind of been swelling over a while and i even got in comments about it on my youtube channel and i thought it was allergies because i was like oh it's just pollen allergies it's just affecting my one eye because maybe i sleep mostly on that side i don't know and my mom came into the states and then vancouver for my ted talk and she's like simone you have to like have a scan or see what's up well like we have to go to the doctor and she really pushed me to do it because i was like i'm fine and i had an mri scan on like five pm on a friday night my boyfriend at the time was there and i remember like halfway through an mri scan they kinda pull you out and they put inject contrast fluid or this like thing that yeah just gives them another type of scan and the nurse looked at me in this way and was like how long have you had symptoms for mhmm and that's when i knew that they'd found something and then they like shoved you back into the machine for another twenty minutes and my ex was just seeing like them like zooming in and out of my scans and there was like this obviously something that just looked wrong in there and they sent me to the er and i found out that i had a brain tumor the size of a golf ball that probably been grown since i was a teenager so it'd been growing over like ten fifteen years and yeah i had surgery to remove it and then it kept on growing the parts that they couldn't remove and i went through radiation treatment so that was like two years that just was kind of dedicated to just getting better and getting back to where i am now and i remember like i was so stoked about twenty twenty because i was like this is the first year that i'm not held back by my health that i'm like finally gonna be able to do everything unfethered and then the pandemic happens and you're kinda just like okay just in the back seat of what's happening and things that are out of my control again in your public you made a couple of videos about yeah about it i have a brain tumor my brain tumor is back mhmm you kinda you know you name your tumor brian mhmm you kinda make it a lighthearted thing but so you don't reveal much of the darkness but were you scared or some low points of course i was of course i was scared i mean i it's terrifying it's like and also when it's in your brain like you know i was like take any other part of me but don't take my brain no it's this unfathomable thing that happens and you're like i'm healthy i've had how could this possibly be a brain tumor like my eye is swollen like there's nothing there i haven't had any seizures i haven't had any cognitive issues i haven't had any headaches even like how is that even possible so you go through a lot of different stages of just trying to understand what it is and i think i remember being hit like right as i found out when we're in like an uber poor uber driver from where i had my mri scan to the er where they sent me and i was really both really grateful that i've gotten so much more out of life than i ever thought i would like i've had a hell of a life and even if it would have ended really early i would have done so much more than i ever thought but i was also really really sad that i hadn't had kids yet like that was my big grief of like fuck i haven't had had had time to have kids yet but no it's terrifying i mean the prospect of somebody cutting up your head like that's terrifying but it honestly wasn't as bad as i thought it was gonna be what about the radiation treatment what what are some things that you know people should well you learned about it about the process and about yourself through that that that people might be interested about i think surgery was both harder and easier than radiation treatment because it was it was harder because it was so much more intense and it's such a dramatic thing like going to the hospital that morning and being like i don't know and you feel so awful when you wake up and but then the recovery from it was pretty linear like almost every week i would get a little bit better the thing about radiation is that it was not linear at all and it kind of drained me in this weird like it was so hard to predict and also they put me on these i spent months feeling like i was high out of my mind and i couldn't process reality in a way that i normally would like everything just felt off like i felt yeah i felt like i was high on drugs and i kept on asking my doctors what was going on and they're like no i don't know i don't think it's anything related and i was on this alzheimer's medicine that they put you on to prevent dementia from radiation treatment like kind of as a preventative and i found all these subreddits of people using that alzheimer's medicine to get high and people be like oh my god bro i took like twenty milligrams yesterday and i was high out of my mind and i'm like i'm on thirty milligrams a a day like of course it feels weird and that was honestly one of the scariest parts of it because that was the first time where i felt like it genuinely affected my way of processing reality and yeah i was so relieved when i found out that that was what was causing it because i felt like i was going crazy but even after surgery like i woke up and i felt like myself like everything was i got no brain injuries so obviously this is like my experience from somebody who came out of it pretty unscathed who didn't get any brain injuries and didn't have to do any of that recovery it's more just the recovery from like the physical act of somebody cutting your skull open and taking a large chunk out did you research all the things that can go wrong no brain surgery no i honestly i'm i'm a bit surprised by how i acted it's pausing for you to pour you're welcome editors i commercial this is like work injury from being a youtuber it's all like freeze if there's audio that comes in yeah sponsored by tap water i was surprised by how little i was willing to think critically about what my doctors told me to do like i very early on i i the neurologist that i worked with he was the one who was on call at the er the day where i came in and he was the one who ended up doing my surgery and he kind of became like my rock in this and i just one hundred percent trusted him and he turned out to be an amazing doctor and like did a great job and was just like so i got so so lucky but i remember my mom being like oh but we should like talk about second opinions and like we should try to do more research and i was like so unwilling to do that because opening up to the idea that there are multiple ways or multiple things that might be right or wrong was so terrifying like i wanted there to just be like no this is the only option this is what we need to do and if i started questioning that then i don't know if i would have been able to go through with it so yeah it was a strange i just really wanted to trust the doctors that i worked with and i was very scared to question them in any way how did that process change your relationship with death are you afraid of death no do you ponder your mortality yeah i think it took away a part of youth for me like the innocence yeah i mean you kind of think of terrible things as something that happens to other people and death and illness so i think it kind of fast tracked that for me but it mostly changed my relationship to life it changed it's made me so much more gentle with myself like going through illness it forces you to redefine what it means to be good and before being good had been pushing myself really hard it had been working and i don't know just just being really hard with myself and disciplined and when you're healing from something being good is listening to your body it's resting it's like really being in tune with what your health where your health is at and i think that is something that's kind of stuck with me since then i'm like so much more gentle and delicate with myself and with others or you fuck i think it definitely it's like when you're young and healthy it's really hard to yeah know what it feels like to be ill yeah and i remember you know you like go to yoga class and you'd be like oh my god this is too slow like i want it to be i have so much more energy like i need to and when i was recovering from my brain surgery there was this yoga studio nearby my house and they had yoga for seniors and i was so stoked because i was like oh this is a yoga class i'll be able to take yeah and i think that was really eye opening of just like there's no you kind of imagine that it's just like oh just push yourself harder but no that's not it with age or sickness or it's just you gotta be so gentle with yourself and you have to cater to people where they're at yeah and just appreciation of this like biological vehicle you get and you should take care of it being sick sucks yeah it's awful and i really i'm really motivated to postpone that for as much as i can and also i was so tremendously grateful when i got ill that i felt like i had so much to take from like i had so many energy reservoirs i'd spent my life taking pretty decent care of my body and like exercising and eating well and like not wrecking my body in any way and i felt like this was the first time where that was so critical and i felt like my body was ready for it you know i thought you're gonna go the other way like you can you can take care of your body all you want it's bad stuff happens so you should you should go on drug binges and go wild and do crazy things and i mean i also had that that thought where i was like i fucking floss every day how do i have a brain tumor i've been good like why does this happen to me but more so it was like my body was so resilient and ready for it and i was i was really really proud of it it's amazing that the human body is able to recover from even the harshest things yeah it's it's wild and my brain so after after surgery because yeah i had a brain tumor the size of a golf ball kinda behind my right eye and after brain surgery you kind of just have this big hole in your head like this void and usually your brain stays that way like it retains the shape even after the brain tumor is gone but for some reason my brain was feeling really ambitious and it has completely flopped back and i have almost like a normal looking brain now where doctors are like oh we would almost not be able to tell that you had one so yeah that just blew my mind i feel like when did it was that why i had all those headaches after surgery it's just my brain being like tried working yeah oh pretty cool thing i wanted to ask you about is the everyday calendar that you worked on mhmm that was a long time that took a long time yeah so basically i i designed this calendar like i wanted to start meditating every day mhmm but it's really hard to meditate every day and to like kinda build that habit and what i would do is i would make these grids in my notebooks where i could like check a box for every day like i just wanted like a little thing i did it and like this thing of accountability but then i was like this is i don't wanna have a notebook that i do this in like i want an art piece that i can hang on my wall like accountability art and i made this thing called the everyday calendar which has an entire year on it so it's three hundred and sixty five days and if you tap any of the days you light it up and we turned it into a kickstarter campaign and it's now a product that i'm selling in my through my product business the yatch store what's it called the yatch store yeah and that for people who are confused is the right way to pronounce your last name which doesn't it's right but it's so wrong it makes my last name is spelled g i e r t z who does that song if loving you is wrong i don't wanna be right yeah that's singing my last name yeah that's what that's what makes it because what's his name the the the from the office he covers it from the british office which is the better office okay tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent so you said you created the everyday calendar to make a more beautiful in quotes and more sacred gold star system on a wall not a notebook that gets thrown into a drawer yeah well well said past me you you said that making this calendar taught you a lot in quotes i feel like a like a real investigative journalist you've said in two thousand eighteen yeah i'm waiting for the gotcha can you share some of the lessons you've learned like what what do you mean you've you've learned a lot from making this calendar uh-oh what are we talking about as somebody who builds things manufacturing something is such an unrelated process like making one of something and making ten thousands of something like they're not even distant cousins like it's completely different beasts to tackle and yeah so that was one of it everything takes so much longer than you think it's going to i did a kickstarter campaign that we launched in twenty eighteen after my surgery and yeah it's just you know you think you're so generous with the timelines we still ended up being a year late but we shipped we're we're good but yeah i mean i'm trying to get my product business off the ground we launched in may and it's just yeah it's just a pain as somebody who's terrified of disappointing people i'm like why have i chosen some of the jobs where it's the easiest to disappoint people you can disappoint people at scale now yeah i can disappoint people at scale and also them actually haven't paid me money to deliver on something which is a terrible transaction but it's i'm just stoked to realize that i love the job still like i love the product development aspect of it i love trying to design stuff for manufacturing and figure it out and like anticipate how people are gonna use your products and like the everyday calendar i mean we've sold thousands of them now they're all over the world and it's like people actually finding something useful that i made and implementing them into their lives it's just mind boggling especially because this is tracking habits good habits so this is ones you can do it whenever use it however you want i went in a drinking binge again today yeah success great kicked another kid what does it take to mass manufacture something what did you learn about that like what what are can can you like elucidate the gap between the one the prototype versus the the like product development for mass manufacture i mean for one of it is like yeah the manufacturing the tooling that they use in manufacturing then it's gonna take me seventeen hours but obviously you can't spend seventeen hours then it's gonna take me seventeen hours but obviously you can't spend seventeen hours per calendar when you're doing something in factory i think it's that like quality control is such a beast you cannot trust anybody telling you that things are gonna be okay like you're you have to have such trust issues and it's also terrifying i mean as somebody who's doing everything independently i haven't raised any capital for it like it's all self invested and we're doing it all in house it's just you know yeah i could buy ten thousand calendars but then what if all of them are have a manufacturing issue or you know it's just it's just terrifying because the risks are so high but also i got to this point where for one this is something that i wanted to do for a long time but something that going through health problems taught me is how fragile my business model is because i mean i'm basically running an influencer business where i make videos on youtube and then i have an ad spot and i talk about a brand so like i'm a human billboard which is fine it grants me a lot of freedom to play around but if i am not well enough to be on a stage giving talks or be in front of a camera everything stops like it's such a pillar of a business and it can topple over at any given moment or like youtube could change the algorithm like legislation could catch up and change how you're able to advertise on the internet like it's so frail and i really felt like i need to diversify what i'm doing and also just to keep it interesting for myself so what i decided was to start a product business because also it's kind of this perfect combination of businesses where i can turn my youtube channel into an r and d department because i have a reason to constantly be exploring things and turning out new products i can also do that as early audience testing and see what people are actually excited about and if there's something that i think would make an interesting product i can pass that over to the product business and then once i'm ready to market that and sell it i can pass it over to the youtube channel so it's like i can kind of once i realized that youtube didn't feel like an end goal for me i was like okay then i can use it as a tool to accomplish these other things that i wanna do and this was one of them so yeah it's a lot that went into it and one of the tools like you said is r and d but it's also kind of advertisement for the cool stuff that you're doing i think i think mister beast is one of the creators that's also starting to understand this power mhmm of this reputation that you've built of like people trust you like they love you to do cool stuff they trust that you put your heart and soul into a thing yeah so like and they feel your pain and the struggle too you know like if a product like for example say the everyday calendar like there was issues in manufacturing something like this which we had yeah they would feel the pain of that and there was still support i mean that that's the beauty of it when you have the actual person right there struggling with their with their lows and highs that's a decision that i made really early on where i was like the yatch store is supported by me but it's separate from me it's not merchandise you don't have to know who i am or care about who i am to be interested in this product and if you go on the website y e t c h dot store mhmm plug it's like it's i'm on the about page y e t c h dot store like you have to go to the about page to find anything about me like it's definitely not like this is samo's brand and i think anybody who's followed me for a long time will see that like my personality is sprinkled into it but it's still like clean off of me and i think that's also because i wanted something that was separate from me because i am also running out of narcissism believe it or not like i don't feel like i wanna i don't want it to be about me and i want it to be something that can also run independently of me and doesn't like i i wanna be able to retire my face and still do like the other stuff because i think it's fun but i don't want that to be the core of it what other kind of stuff have you worked on for the product design for for yatch so i mean a lot of the products i decided to launch the store with a really small roster of products because developing products is such a it's it's such upfront heavy like cost wise and just investment such a it's very big upfront investment so and i know that it would take a while or i knew it would take a while for me to kinda find the right tonality and visual language for the brand so i just wanted to launch it have it be out there start working on it start like learning more about what it entails even if we just had a small roster product so we released it with we have a puzzle yes because this is a whim but i wanted to release a puzzle that has one piece missing so it's actually as far as i can tell it's the world's first officially incomplete puzzle you get four hundred and ninety nine out of five hundred pieces i keep the five hundredth piece so i have a box in my workshop with everybody's missing pieces yeah and i don't know what to do with it yet but someday it will come to me profound artistic statement it is something it's definitely something and i i i'm surprised by how many of them we've sold which i also like i kinda wanted to have that product product out there because i was like can you imagine having a pitch deck if i do ever raise money of being like you know how good i am at selling things i sold people five thousand incomplete puzzles puzzles also have you know it's like a lot of the products i call them basket fillers like they're kind of just like stuff where i'm like yeah this is like easy to throw into your basket i mean we have these rings i'm wearing them so so there's a screwdriver ring which is a phillips head screwdriver and then a screw ring that kind of has a recess like a phillips head screw i have these sawdust socks that make you look like your feet are covered in sawdust like you spend all time in the all day in the shop without having to put any of the actual effort in but then we have four more products in the pipeline that we're working on and that are kind of the more the the big ambitious products that are more in line with what i want the brand to be like the tagline is unique solutions to everyday problems and it's just a lot of like trying to develop novel takes on existing product so something where the function becomes a bigger bigger part of the design yeah and so what's the process of creating something like that like the even the everyday calendar so like what what are some challenges that are interesting along the way so you have to sketch it out you have to like brainstorm draw things out and then create a schematic and see like how how do you know what it's going to look like visually don't yeah and it's i mean i so the everyday calendar the first so i just built it for myself first like that did not come as a as a product idea first and that's kind of been the process that i've had for a lot of things like i make it for myself and then i'm like oh maybe other people would find this useful too so the everyday calendar the first prototype i made it had actually physical mechanical toggle switches so three hundred and sixty five toggle switches that you could flip so if you worked out that day or meditated for me it was meditating you can just flip that switch and that was great but when i started evaluating it as a product it's if you have three hundred and sixty five of something in a product like the runaway cost is crazy so the cheapest option most reliable option we could find was capacitive touch so basically it's a touch interface and the front plate is a circuit board itself so it's just like circuit board that's designed in this really fancy way so it looks like a a beautiful piece of art not to do my own work too much but it's actually a circuit board which i also thought was really interesting products and it felt like a nod to my career in electronics as well being like no let's make it pretty let's make it put it front and forward but yeah i mean what i'm realizing now more and more is like there's so many of like i would love to turn the puzzle table into a product but then it's like that would be a seven thousand dollar table and i don't wanna sell a table for seven thousand dollars so you're kind of limited to the price bracket you're in and it's like your margins are tough like maintaining your margins are really really tough and as somebody who's like i would love to sell the stuff that we're doing cheaper but you just it's just not feasible like you need those margins to survive and well one of the the genius things in the conversations i've had with elon is the ability through sort of systematic questioning of how things have been done in the past to discuss what is the lowest cost way to solve a problem so he's very good at getting to like with optimus robot for example the humanoid robot how do you get the cost down yeah and that seems to be like one of the essential things to do in in any product that you have to mass manufacture it's constantly discussed like how do we simplify simplify it's definitely a design limitation that's interesting it's both hard and interesting to work within and that's such a different thing as well it's like because i talked about before like what is the context in which you're creating things like i'm still building things i'm still inventing things but i changed the context and it has a very different set of limitations and constantly trying to simplify your product to make it cheaper and yeah it's a really interesting and different type of design process lose some of the magic though right like people can do that a little bit too much i think apple is famous like johnny ive is famous for sort of focusing on design first and not worrying about the cost later because you don't wanna sacrifice there's some stuff that's gonna cost more but it keeps yeah some of the magic i think it's for some of the products that we're working on it's like i'm like let's just make it the best we think it can be and then we can scale back from there like just like let's not impose these limitations on ourselves up front like let's just make it the most beautiful version of itself and then we can decide what we wanna compromise with mhmm or compromise on yeah that's what i say every every day when i look in the mirror you're just so beautiful and then we can compromise yeah i'll just discuss that suit yeah yeah and then see how shit goes wrong later alright alright i'll back a little bit to the robots just or actually to one of your more epic projects i mean they're all epic but trucklet yeah you cutting into a tesla and turning into an epic truck what was that like where did the idea come from the idea came from that i really wanted an electric pickup truck yeah like i've only really driven electric because i got my driver's license pretty late and i'm like one of the first generation drivers it's like probably never gonna have a gas vehicle but yeah this was in twenty eighteen as well twenty eighteen was a big year yeah yeah or twenty nineteen i can't remember and i figured that we could just make our own so you took a tesla tesla model three model three mhmm and you cut off a piece of it mhmm and you turn it into a pickup truck what's the it looks pretty badass so like what what are some of the challenges of doing that it's unlike other projects you've done yeah it's it's very much outside of my realm like i'm not a a car person i haven't worked on cars before so we brought in a big team and had another project manager for it and stuff because also like cars you definitely don't want things to go wrong like there's no part of me that wants to fuck around and make something that's gonna be really unsafe for me or for other people who are driving with me so yeah i mean it was about a year of planning and then we got the car and then we spent a month just tearing it apart and trying to make it i i was so set like i really wanted the car just for its function mhmm and i was like i'm so fine with if it's really ugly mhmm but then we managed to make it actually look really good oh so that that wasn't part of the discussion like how the final thing looks i wasn't i wasn't so i wasn't that fussed about it i was like i just want it to i just want it for its function like i really want this car i don't want it because it looks cool but then it ended up looking pretty cool as well and i'm really i mean even now a couple of years later when there are some more options of electric pickup trucks i still stand truck law like she's like rivian ford f one fifty like they're all great but they're giant you're sitting there on the porch in your in your cowboy hat yeah drinking whiskey and saying with my cattle dog yeah yeah no i shotguns i wanted like a a small nineties pickup truck back to shitty robots you reused parts of previous robots a lot what's like a memorable example of that it's just the graveyard of parts in the workshop i've gotten better at keeping projects intact in the beginning i used to disassemble every project because i was also a much a much more stringent budget so if i needed a motor then i would like steal it off of an existing robot or a previous robot but i've gotten really good at not doing that now because i'm like maybe one day i wanna have a museum exhibit and then it would be nice to have all of those machines intact and not having to rebuild them centuries from now the you know you can look at benjamin franklin's house mhmm oh yeah nobody's gonna look at my house yeah yeah it's just house just move it some weird shit yeah that goes great with my idea of myself with the autobiography yeah yeah you said that people keep requesting in the comments they that i put a dildo on it yeah i have i have wait was that actually what you were gonna ask yeah i have dildo written in my notes i thought i just made it into a raunchy punchline we knew we were actually gonna get there yeah that was in the early days in the shitty robot days but now i have a filter on my youtube channel for every possible spelling of dildo so do i mean people want to probably sexualize robots right and then or or they put they wanna sexualize my relationship with them yeah oh you know because i have majority male followers and they're so sweet and so like respectful ninety nine percent but i realized like there is a lot of i've realized that society hasn't taught men how to have female role models and the way that people channel it is through being like oh it's because i wanna fuck her or i wanna date her or i wanna marry her and i'm like i don't think you want any of those things i think you actually just admire my work mhmm but you don't know how to look up to a woman yeah that's beautifully put what about weapons do you get requests to put weapons on a thing yeah it's interesting i kind of started in robotics as just like a happy camper who is really into like tinkering and now i'm kind of seeing some of the darker parts of it and i remember first time i went to a proper factory and i saw like big industrial robot arms at work and i was like oh wow this is what it is about you know and it was almost scary where i was like oh i've just been like playing around with these tiny versions of this and i'm like oh my god everybody robotics is cool and fun and then you get in there and you're like this is kind of terrifying you were platforming the very things that will destroy you yes conversation no you're making it fun and entertaining i'm the mouthpiece and i'm like getting people into robotics and engineering and we're all just building our demise yeah and accelerating speed no but i mean i had that in like as the same with also with like companies who are saying that they're never gonna put weapons on their robots and then have military contracts and stuff like that and you're like this is dark and scary fortunately i haven't gotten a lot of requests for it yeah drones are terrifying especially they're fucking terrifying and it's really everything i mean we humans are so good at creative ways of killing and fucking each other it's like almost how everything goes yes like and it's yeah i i'm i'm terrified of the future where we are gonna use more robots to kill each other and come up with new and new creative ways to kill and hurt each other yeah emotionally psychologically physically yeah speaking of which what are your thoughts about i don't know if you've been paying attention but chad gpt the advancement in in language models and artificial intelligence have you added speaking capabilities to any of your devices i have i have siri on yeah i used to have an amazon echo in my house but then i removed it it just freaked me out that i could whisper from my bed and it heard me yeah i'd be like alexa play spotify i'd be like playing spotify yeah fuck i i think it is a powerful tool that we are not fully ready for yeah and i don't know i i think the internet is kind of a parade of us using powerful things in harmful ways and i think chatbots are really really exciting i'm stoked to have a personal assistant that's like or a virtual assistant that actually does a good job and can solve problems for me but yeah it also feels like it can get dark really really quickly yeah because you can form close connections like we're talking about with it and then it can be used to manipulate you mhmm manipulate you in terms of what is true and manipulate you in terms of getting you to buy stuff yeah or maybe because at least for now it's centralized getting everybody to think the same way i mean for i mean it's the same in like algorithms being used to radicalize people or kind of having that as a consequence of the way that they work and combine that with a really advanced language model and like you can control people's worldview in a way that you couldn't i mean it's just it's it's wild and i think we're not ready for it and i don't know if we ever would be because we're very impressionable little squishy flush bags which takes us back to the when the squishy flush flush bags interact which one pops first still on bubble to this cool the bubble around bubble on bubble new people paper coming out in like three minutes what were we talking about oh what about consciousness so you never anthropomorphize the robots did they ever come to life for you where you kinda thought no because i built them and i know how they work so that prevents you from being able to see the magic i don't know yeah but i think it's like i definitely when i did a lot of the shitty robot stuff like i wanted them to move like a a human or like in a more organic way and not just like point a to point b yeah just use his way to program stuff so i wanted other people to them but i don't think i did necessarily i'm trying to think of a piece of technology that i've kind of projected feelings upon but no i can't so sometimes what makes me anthropomorphize something even though i built it is there's element of surprise so especially with machine learning you're surprised by the kind of things it does mhmm have have you ever been surprised by a robot no because they're all pretty dumb like also the robots i built it's like they're all just servos moving from i mean they're i don't think i've built anything with a huge amount of sensors or like they're just moving in a pattern that i program them to move what's the most complex thing you've built i mean probably truckload truckload yeah was complex just for the sheer scale of it and like the i mean the i think that was my biggest project both in terms of build scope but also in terms of impact that it had like that project just went wild but then yeah and i don't know the bubble wrap music box i don't know they're all complicated in different ways that that one is epic how does the bubble wrap connect to the flute by the way what's how does that work the flute is just right where like mount it right where it pops it okay yeah that's so fascinating i gotta watch everything yeah that was fun funny enough in my deep investigative journalistic research of you yeah says you're you're used to be an mma reporter yeah how how how did how did that happen how did you get into it i was really into martial arts i was like a huge ufc buff i mean this is twenty ten maybe you practiced martial arts yourself i did yeah i was mostly stand up i did really i did a lot of muay thai and then some brazilian jiu jitsu and just yeah i was really the thing is i i get really intense about my hobbies and i was so into it i was all in awesome and i had worked a little bit as a journalist and i was like oh i should like do mma reporting and i emailed this mma website in sweden i was like hey can i come and write for you and they were like oh actually we're going to an event in gothenburg tomorrow do you wanna come yeah and i was like wow this is a lot it's like eleven pm at night but sure i'll come and i went there to their office i'd never really met them and i'm like this is kinda scary like i'm a twenty year old girl and going there in a group of men with a group of men and they were so rude they'd like i i went there and i was like hey what's up and they were all kind of ignoring me and just like not looking at me or interacting with me until they realized that simon was a girl because we'd only talked over email and they're like oh this guy named simon is gonna come and then they were like oh fuck simon it's actually simone yeah and it's a girl so i kind of like slid into that in a very very strange way and i did that for a year but then i got kicked out of an interview with alexander gustavsson and i would pronunciation is so good yeah what it and then i just kind of never went back and i was done with it and now i'm not allowed to do martial arts because of brain stuff so i've i've kind of put all of that behind me and it's it's interesting it's like i definitely see the athleticism in it and the skill that goes into it i think as the older i get the more concerned i am about the health impacts of the sport and of the people who are practicing it on an elite level and i'm just not as cannot as one hundred percent just cheer as somebody beats somebody else up into a pulp yeah especially considering the effects it might have on the brain mhmm may i ask why you got kicked out no to the customer interview is anything fun so it's embarrassing what what happened it wasn't i didn't it was not i didn't intend to get kicked out i didn't realize i was gonna get kicked out so it was alexandre gosselin was gonna fight jon jones yeah and he had just he was kind of like this golden boy in sweden mhmm and he had just come out to the press that he had actually been to jail for violent crimes and all i wanted to ask all i asked was what was the reason that you wanted to bring that forward now and apparently that was completely like blacklisted but i hadn't gotten briefed about it at all and the the pr man head of pr of the ufc was just yelling at me and they kicked me out of of in stockholm and i immediately called my mom and i was like mom you will not believe what just happened i got kicked out of an interview at grand hotel because in the nineties she got kicked out of an interview with mel gibson from the grand hotel so that's like runs in the family so i was just like she's proud of you yeah no it was just this weird generational skip where we both gotten kicked out of interviews at the same hotel you spent quite a bit of time in china as a student is that something you could speak to the differences in culturally maybe even from like a student in engineering perspective between china and us maybe even sweden those are like technologically speaking just such fundamentally different places i mean i moved to china when i was sixteen yeah and i went there as an exchange student so that is before i had ever touched upon those things and it was and then i went back when i was nineteen to work as an english teacher for a little bit it was it was incredibly challenging to be there the language barrier the language the culture all of it i mean i was i was like now when i look at sixteen year olds i'm like you're a baby and i moved sorry ten to sixteen year olds listening to this but like i just can't believe i did that and yeah i didn't speak the language i got placed in like a small city with almost no foreigners it's just a constant audience of people staring at you because they haven't interacted with a lot of foreigners before and yeah it definitely and then after that i moved to kenya and i think that was one of the reasons why it was so interesting to move to the states because people were like oh isn't it like hard with the language barrier or the cultural difference and i was like there's this is nothing and i could speak the language like i could speak english well and i could kind of pass as an american even just as i moved here and it was such a relief where i was like wow i'm like an undercover foreigner because i got to a point where i realized like it doesn't matter how good my mandarin is i'm never people are never gonna fully accept me here so yeah and you moved you went to kenya you've spoken about this after your parents got divorced yeah when did i talk about that i didn't realize i told that story i know i know so many things what do you think this is is it from when i have my amazon echo installed yeah i yeah so i few contacts i came home from china first time i was there for a year it's one of the most turned upside down days of my life i'd spent a year there and i was so excited i had a really rough year and i was so excited just to come home and like be a child again i remember thinking and just like feeling like i belonged and then i came home and i found out that my parents had separated when i was gone and they hadn't told me because they wanted to like not affect my stay there which i think was one hundred percent the right decision of them to make but i kind of came home to a house that was starting to get picked apart and it's a big shock to your world it was both yes and no i think i remember i just sat down on my bed and i was like well this isn't what i expected but i guess i'll move to kenya because that was one of the few there were a few swedish boarding schools in the world there was one in brussels paris london and then one in nairobi and i didn't wanna miss more school because i'd taken a gap year when i went to china so i was like i guess i'll go to nairobi and i'm thinking now like i i think if my parents had stayed together granted it was amazing that they they did made the right decision in every way but i my roots kind of never grew back after that and i think i just kept on moving abroad and moving around and being really restless and yeah have you ever been able to find a home spiritually i have a home yeah i mean i have a home in the people around me and i have i have a lot of different homes you know it's i think what i'm realizing more and more is like you cannot live without consequence and compromise and sometimes i can envy people who have that like same friend group that they had their entire life or that you know just really belong in a place and i realized that would be amazing but i've chosen different experiences and one of the upsides of that is i can feel home almost anywhere one of the downsides of that is that i cannot feel fully at home anywhere wow that's deeply and darkly poetic do you feel at home probably the way you put it is really beautifully put yeah no i have to find home in the people i love yeah yeah what advice would you give to young people that look at your stellar life the trajectory of of your career as a human being as a creator as a engineer as a designer as a incredibly interesting personality who's working on an autobiography what advice would you give them like how how to make their way in this life maybe high school students maybe college students on how they can have a career they can be proud of or a life they can be proud of oh my god luxe you know it's this is not the advice but there are very few moments in a career that feel as good as you think they are going to and there are very few moments of feeling really proud of yourself like i feel like i often just feel like i'm not doing it well enough or big enough or and now i just had one of those moments like hearing you say that i'm like oh i'm actually doing okay i think my main advice is enthusiasm is a much more potent fuel in life than duty and just because something is boring doesn't mean that it's important i kinda realized for myself that like i'm so much better at the things i enjoy but school doesn't really teach us how to stay excited about something and how to stay enthusiastic about something and if you can find that then like you got a gold mine of potential so i kind of had to reprogram myself to be like just because this is fun doesn't mean that it's not important mhmm because i had so much guilt about it in this weird way or where i'm like no this is too fun this can't be work and i'm like no it's still work the boring stuff isn't more important and the the vice versa as you said just because it's boring and hard doesn't mean it's the right thing to do yeah that's interesting i i'm gonna have to take that advice and think through it because my genetically i'm built a little bit like if this is really unpleasant it's probably good for me yeah and it's a dangerous thing to to think sometimes it's true sometimes it's not yeah no and it's like what comes really easy and where do you have that kind of effortless momentum and enthusiasm and that is kind of the sweet spot i think that i'm also really happy that i spent time trying out so many different jobs i mean i had i've had so many different jobs before i did it and i would do things for a year and then i quit and it feels like i tried on a bunch of different pants and you're like okay i can kinda wear this but they're like not super comfortable or i don't love the look of them or whatever and now i feel like i found this pair of pants that just like fits me perfectly mhmm and that perfectly caters to my strengths and my weaknesses like i used to work as an editor for the swedish government and i remember thinking like oh i need to be okay that not a lot of things are happening and that things are moving slowly and that the work is kind of like monotonous and then i realized like or maybe i should be in a workplace where it's a benefit or strength that i want a lot of things to happen and that i can handle a high speed yeah you know and i think that is really such a good question task as well like what are my strengths what are my weaknesses and in what context are most of these things strengths and if you're know that if you know the measurements you can find the right fitting pants yeah or the right suit as lex will tell you what do you think is the meaning of life oh i don't think there's any meaning it's it's a meaningless void no just that it doesn't have any meaning doesn't mean that it's meaningless i don't think that there's this big grand meaning i think a more important question is what brings you substantial joy in your life to me it's the relationships with people that i have love yeah i mean love in all different kinds of form it's i'm really working on figuring out how to build more community especially in a society that isn't really made for it i want more passive hangouts with people where like i just want people who are there together to get high no together okay to get high maybe together yeah i mean i like i i think seeing somebody for lunch and kind of shooting the shit and what's what's the latest with you is great but like what i want is somebody to just roll up in sweatpants and open my fridge and like be like what are you gonna do i don't know maybe i'll read a book like yeah i think that sharing kinda like silence sharing silence being alone together and that just that type of community i think is what i'm really seeking out now because i think yeah and also like working on a goal on a joint goal together with other people you know i think being a youtuber can be really lonely i mean as much as i'm working with a team it's like yeah i just wanna work in a bigger project and kind of have that sense of wow we're like doing this together because i think that accesses my pride a lot better than just being proud of myself it's so much easier for me to be proud of a team than for me to be proud of myself that's probably good advice for people who are doing creative work on youtube to to to work on to work on a team yeah and just choose try to do things take it from the queen of shitty robots but like try to do things with integrity former queen of shitty robots do things with integrity like anything you do on the internet is kind of i think of things as tattoos on my internet and on my internet self and i'm i'm really happy that i said no to some things early in my career that i know that i would have regretted now and you know just think of it in the long term like going viral is overwhelming and so stressful and so fun but like so intense and i'm i'm really happy that i managed to build that into a more long term career than just have it be something that passed and come down from the the viral moment and maintain your humanity yeah and also really deliberately defining what success means to you because there are so many reasons or so many definitions that other people will give you and especially when you're working on the internet there are just numbers upon numbers that are like you're doing well you're not doing well and something i'm really happy that i did was early on i really tried to think of like what does success look like for me and i realized that it's not having the world's biggest youtube channel it's being proud of the projects that i put out and having full say in how i spend my time like that is the most important thing to me and if i had a huge youtube channel and i was making so much money but i kind of had this machine run me rather than the other way around like to me it's so important to be able to wake up in the morning and be like i don't wanna do this anymore and for that to be okay and i think i defined that for myself early on and i've really tried to live by it and made decisions after that and i'm really happy that i did that and also you're with with the store with the design you're doing now you're putting a little bit of love in the products you create at scale i mean that's what johnny i did mhmm that's the cool thing so you could create something beautiful and then people could share that love at scale it's terrifying and beautiful and i'm so here for it i'm here for it too i'm a big fan i'm a big fan of who you are i'm a big fan of everything you do of putting yourself out there putting your love out there in terms of the designs you create also just because i'm a fan of robotics i think you inspire a lot of people i think the shitty robots are actually incredible robots mhmm and it's incredible engineering that's all that's that's the best combination of design and engineering and fun all of it together
