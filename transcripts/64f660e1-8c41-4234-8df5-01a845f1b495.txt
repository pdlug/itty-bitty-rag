following is a conversation with chris tarbell a former fbi special agent and cybercrime specialist who tracked down and arrested russ ullbrecht the leader of silk road the billion dollar drug marketplace and he tracked down and arrested hector monsegur aka sabu of lulzsec and anonymous which are some of the most influential hacker groups in history he is cofounder of naxo a complex cybercrime investigation firm and is a cohost of a podcast called the hacker and the fed this conversation gives the perspective of the fbi cybercrime investigator both the technical and the human story i would also like to interview people on the other side the cybercriminals who have been caught and perhaps the cybercriminals who have not been caught and are still out there and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this podcast we got true classic tees for shirts insidetracker for bio monitoring expressvpn for privacy betterhelp for mental health and blinkist for nonfiction choose wisely my friends and now onto the full ad reads as always no ads in the middle i try to make this interesting but if you skip them please still check out our sponsors i enjoy their stuff maybe you will too this show is brought to you by true classic tee's high quality soft slim fitted t shirts for men they also make other men's wear staples like polos walkout shirts and boxers but i have a lot of their black t shirts that's my main go to i'm not exactly sure why but there's a certain kind of comfort in having a great t shirt that all look the same having many of them so it removes that extra little decision in your life so you can liberate your mind to focus on the more difficult decisions in your life so it's just this reliable thing i can count on either i wear a suit or i wear a true classic t t shirt that's it that's all i need to worry about life is simple and there's a kind of minimalist aesthetic to a black t shirt that just brings out the best in me makes my soul sing i think it's also in part a programmer aesthetic engineer aesthetic i'm not exactly sure but i do know that a lot of programmers i hang out with often wear black t shirts so i'm not sure what that's about that could also just be in general a guy thing i'm gonna have to get some data on that anyway go to true classic dot com and enter code lex to get twenty five percent off this show is also brought to you by insidetracker a service i use to track biological data your lifestyle decisions should be made based on data coming from your own body i can't wait until the day that we have high bandwidth signal coming from the body at a frequency that is exceptionally high so we have this short term and long term data about what's going on inside our body just raw data so machine learning algorithms can just interpret that data to make decisions based on i mean to me that's such an exciting world of creating systems that are able to truly listen to our body there's experiences i have but going to doctors i think the job of a doctor is so difficult they get just few little inklings into the symptoms you provide there's some data they can collect they can do mris and all that kind of scans it's not a high resolution picture of what's going on in your body now if you're the average case for a particular condition or disease or a particular issue you're having in your life yeah fine but a lot of us are not the perfectly representative average case in fact most humans aren't and so it makes sense that we should be looking at that specific person to make decisions for that specific person anyway get special savings for a limited time when you go to inside tracker dot com slash flex this show is brought to you by

that i've tried but there's a huge amount of them i think there's a website called distrowatch that looks at the popularity based on how often they're searched i think of of different distributions of linux in it it's kinda cool to see all the different flavors it's really exciting how active the community is in the development of those flavors anyway go to express v p n dot com slash legspot for

our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's chris tarbell you are one of the most successful cybersecurity law enforcement agents of all time you tracked and brought down russ albrecht aka dread pirate roberts who ran silk road and sabu of lulzsec and anonymous who was one of the most influential hackers in the world so first can you tell me the story of tracking down ross ulbricht and silk road let's start from the very beginning maybe let's start by explaining what is the silk road it was really the first dark market website you literally could buy anything there take that back you couldn't there's two things you couldn't buy there you couldn't buy guns because there was a different website and you couldn't buy fake degrees so no one could become a doctor but you could buy literally whatever else you wanted you could roast things drugs you could buy heroin right from afghanistan the good stuff hacking tools you could hack for hire you could buy murders for hire if you wanted someone killed now so when i was an fbi agent i had to kinda sell some of these cases and this was a a big drug case you know that's the way people saw silk road so internally to the fbi how i had to sell it i had to find the worst thing on there they could possibly find and i think one time i saw a posting for baby parts so let's say that you you know had a young child that needed a a liver you could literally go on there and ask for a six month old liver if you wanted to for like surgical operations versus something darker yeah i never saw anything that dark as far as people that wanted e body parts yeah i did interview a cannibal once when i was in the fbi that's another crazy story but but that that one actually weirded me out so i just watched jeffrey dahmer documentary on netflix and it just changed the way i see human beings because it's a it's a it's a portrayal of a normal looking person doing really dark things and doing so not out of a place of insanity seemingly but just because he has almost like a fetish for that kind of thing it's disturbing that people like that are out there so people like that would then be using silk road not like that necessarily but people of different walks of life would be using silk road to primarily what was the prime primary thing drugs it it was primarily drugs and that's where it started it started off with ross ulbrich growing mushrooms out in the wilderness of california and selling them but really his was more of a libertarian viewpoint i mean it was like you choose what you wanna do for yourself and do it and and the way silk road kind of had the anonymity is it used what's called tor the the onion router which is an anonymizing function on on the deep web was actually invented by the us navy back in the mid nineties or so but it also used cryptocurrency so it was the first time like we saw this birth on the internet mixing cryptocurrency and an ip blocking software so you know in cybercrime you go after one the ip address and trace it through the network or two you go after the cash and this one kind of blocked both cash meaning the flow of money yeah physical or digital and then ip is the some kind of identifying thing over the computer it's your telephone number for on your computer so yeah all all computers have you know a unique four octet numbers you know so one two three dot one two three dot one two three dot one two three and then you know the computer uses dns or domain name services to to render that name so if you were looking for you know cnn dot com your computer then translates that to that ip address or that telephone number where it can find that information didn't silk road used to have guns in the beginning or it or or was that considered to have guns or was did it naturally emerge and then russ realized like this is not good it went back and forth i think there were guns on there and he tried to police it you know he he told himself that the the captain of the boat so he had to follow his rules so you know he i think he would took off those posts eventually and and moved guns elsewhere what was the system of censorship that he used like of selecting what is okay and not okay i mean he's alone he's the captain of the boat do you know by chance if there was a lot of debates and criticisms internally amongst the criminals or what is and isn't allowed i mean it's interesting to see a totally different moral code emerge that's outside the legal code of society we did get the the server and was able to read all of the chat logs that that happened i mean all the records were there i don't remember big debates i mean there was a clear leadership yeah and that was the final decision that was the the ceo of silk road and so primarily it was drugs and primarily out of an ideology of freedom which is if you want to use drugs you should be able to use drugs you should put in your body what you wanna put in your body and when you were presenting a case of why this should be investigated you're trying to find as you mentioned the worst possible things on there is that what you were saying so we had arrested a guy named jeremy hammond and he hit himself he was a hacker and he this when we arrested him it was the second time he had been arrested for for hacking he used tor and so that kind of brought us to a point the fbi has a computer system where you look up things you know you look up anything i could look up your name or or whatever if you're associated with my case and we were finding at the time a lot of things in you know you look it up the a case would end be like oh this is tor it just stopped okay like we couldn't get any further yeah so you know we had just had this big arrest of sabu and took down anonymous and and sometimes in the fbi the way it used to the old school fbi when you had a big case and you're working seven days a week and fourteen hours fifteen hours a day you sort of take a break the boss kinda said yeah i'll see you in a few months go go get to know your family a little bit you know and come back but the group of guys i was with was like let's find the next big challenge and that's when we were finding you know case closed it was tor case closed it was tor so said let's take a look at tor and let's see what we can do maybe we'll take a different approach and silk road was being looked at by other law enforcement but it was taken like a drug approach where i'm going to find a drug buyer who got you know the drugs sent to them in the mail and let's arrest up let's go up the chain but the buyers didn't know their dealers they never met them and so you were taking a cybersecurity approach yeah we said let's try to look at this from a cyber approach and see if we can gleam anything out of it so i'm actually indirectly connected uh-oh to i'm i'm i'm sure i'm not admitting anything that's not already on my fbi file oh i can already tell you what you're gonna tell me though what's that that when you're at college you wrote a paper and you're connected to the person that started you son of a bitch you clever son of a bitch i'm an fbi agent or a former fbi agent well how would i not have done it before that i could've told you other stuff no it's exactly what you were about to tell me i was looking up his name because i forgot it so one of my advisers for my phd was rachel greenstead and she is married to roger dingledine which is the cofounder of the tor project and i actually reached out to him last night to do a tor podcast together i don't know it's have no the it was it was a good it was a good party trick i mean it was just cool that you know this and the timing of it it was just like beautiful but just to link around the on the tour project so we understand so tor is this black box that people disappear in in terms of like the when you were tracking people can you paint a picture of what tours used in general are there it's like when you talk about bitcoin for example cryptocurrency especially today much more people use it for legal activity versus illegal activity what about tor tor was originally invented by the us navy so that like spies inside countries could talk to spies and no one could find them there was no way of tracing them and then they released that information free to the world so tor has two different versions of not versions two different ways it can be utilized there's dot onion sites which is like a normal website a dot com but it's only found within the tor browser you can only get there if you know the whole address and get there the other way tor is used is to go through the internet and then come out the other side if you want a different ip address if you're trying to hide your identity so if you were doing like say cybercrime i i would have the victim computer and i would trace it back out to a tor relay and then because you don't have an active connection or what's called a circuit at the time i wouldn't be able to trace it back but even if you had an active circuit i would have to go to each machine physically live and try to rebuild that which is literally impossible so what do you feel about tor ethically philosophically as a human being on this world that spent quite a few years of your life and still trying to protect people so part of my time in the fbi was working on child exploitation kiddie porn as they call it that really changed my life in a way and so anything that helps facilitate the exploitation of children fucking pisses me off and i i i and that sort of jaded my opinion towards towards tour because that because it it helps facilitate those sites so this ideal of freedom that russell albrecht for example tried to embody is something that you don't connect with anymore because of what you've seen that ideal being used for i mean the child exploitation is the specific example for it you know and it's i can it's easy for me to sit here and say child exploit child porn because no one listening to this is ever gonna say that i'm wrong and that we should allow child porn should because some people utilize it in a bad way should it go away no i mean i i'm a technologist i i want technology to move forward you know people are gonna do bad things and they're going to use technology to help them do bad things well let me ask you then i'll we'll jump around a little bit but the things you were able to do in tracking down information and we'll get to it there's some suspicion that this was only possible with mass surveillance like with nsa for example first of all is there any truth to that and second of all what do you feel are the pros and cons of mass surveillance there is no truth to that and then my feelings on mass surveillance if if there was would you tell me probably not yeah i love this conversation so much but what do you feel about the given that you said child porn what are the pros and cons of surveillance at a society level i mean nobody wants to give up their privacy i say that i say no one wants to give up their privacy but i mean i used to have to get a search warrant to look inside your house yeah or i can just log on to your facebook and you've got pictures of all inside your house and what's going on i mean it's not you know so people like the idea of not giving up their privacy but they do it anyways they they're giving away their freedoms all the time they're they're they're carrying watches that gives out their heartbeat to a weight of companies that are storing that i mean what's more personal than your heartbeat so i i think people en masse really want to protect their privacy and i would say most people don't really need to protect their privacy but the case against mass surveillance is that if you want to criticize the government in a very difficult time you should be able to do it so when when you need the freedom you should have it so when you wake up one day and realize there's something going wrong wrong with the country i love i wanna be able to to help that the one of the great things about the united states of america is there's that individual revolutionary spirit like so that the the government doesn't become too powerful you can always protest there's always the best of the ideal of freedom of speech you can always say fuck you to the man and i think there's a concern of direct or indirect suppression of that through mass surveillance you might not is that suppression of that through mass surveillance you might not is that that little subtle fear that grows with time that why you know why bother criticizing the government it's gonna be a headache i'm gonna get a ticket every time i say something bad that kind of thing so it gets out it can get out of hand the bureaucracy grows and the freedom slip away is that's the that's the criticism right i completely see your point and i agree with it i mean but i mean on the other side people criticize the government of these freedoms but i mean tech companies are talking about destroying your privacy and controlling what you can say i realize they're private platforms and you they can decide what's on their platform but you know they're taking away your freedoms of what you can say and we've heard some some things where maybe government officials were in line with with tech companies to take away some of that freedom and that's i i agree with you that gets scary yeah there's something about government that feels maybe because of the history of human civilization maybe because tech companies are a new thing but just knowing the history of abuses of government it there's something about government that enables the corrupting nature of power to take hold at scale more than tech companies at least what we've seen so far yeah i i agree i agree but i mean we haven't had a voice like we've had until recently i mean anyone that has a twitter account now can speak and become a a news article you know my parents didn't have that didn't have that voice if they wanted to speak out against the government or do something they had to go to a protest or organize a protest or you know do something along those lines so you know we have more of a place to put our voice out now yeah it's incredible but that's why it hurts and that's why you notice it when certain voices get removed the president of the united states of america was removed from one such or all such platforms and that hurts yeah that's crazy to me that's insane that's insane that we we we took that away but let's return to to still growth and for us outbreak so how did your path with this very difficult very fascinating case cross we were looking to open a case against tor because there was a problem all the cases were closing because tor so we went on tor and we we came up with twenty six web different onion dot onions that we targeted we were looking for nexuses to hacking because i was on a squad called c y two and we were like the premier squad in new york that was working criminal cyber intrusions and so you know any website that was offered hackers for hire or hacking tools for free in our pay paid services you know like now we're seeing ransomware as a paid service and phishing as a paid service anything that offered that so we opened this case on on i think we called it we say you have to name cases one of the fun thing in the fbi is when you start a case you get to name it you would not believe how much time is spent in coming up with the name yeah you know case he goes well i think we call this onion peeler because of the yeah so a little bit of humor a little bit of wit and some profundity to the language yeah yeah yeah because you're gonna have to work with this for for quite a lot so yeah this one had the potential of being a big one you know because i think i think silk road was like the sixth on the list for that case but we all knew that was sort of the golden ring if you could make the splash that that onion site was going down then it would probably get some publicity and that's part of you know law enforcement is getting some publicity out of it that you know that makes others think not to do it i would just say that tor is the name of the project the browser what is the onion technology behind tor let's say you wanna go to a dot onion site you'll you'll put in the dot onion you wanna go to and your computer will build communications with a tor relay which are all publicly available out there but you'll encrypt it you'll put a package around your data and so it's it's encrypted and so can't read it it goes to that that first relay that first relay knows about you and then knows about the next relay down the chain and so it takes your data and then encrypts that on the outside and sends it to relay number two now relay number two only knows about relay number one it doesn't know who you are asking for this and it goes through there adding those layers on top layers of encryption till it gets to where it is that and then even the onion service doesn't know except for the the relay it came from who it's talking to and so it peels back that gives the information puts another layer back on and so it's it's layers like you're peeling an onion back of the different relays and that encryption protects who the sender is and what information they're sending layers they are the more exponentially difficult it is to decrypt it i mean you get to a a place where you don't have to have so many layers because it mathematically impossible to yeah decrypt it but yeah you know the more relays you have the slower it is i mean that's the one of the big drawbacks on tor is is is how slow it operates so how do you peel the onion so what what are the different methodologies for trying to get some information from a cybersecurity perspective on these operations like the silk road it's very difficult people have come up with different techniques there there there's been techniques to put out in the in the news media about how they do it running like massive amounts of relays and and you're controlling those relays i think i believe someone tried that once so this is a technical solution and and what about social engineering what about trying to infiltrate the actual humans that are using the silk road and trying to get in that way yeah i mean i i i definitely could see the the way of doing that and then in this case in in our takedown we used that there was one of my partners jared darigan he was an hsi investigator and he had worked his way up to be a system admin on the site so that did glean quite a bit information because he was he was inside and and talking to you know at that time we only know it as dpr or dread pirate roberts we didn't know who who that was yet but but we had that open communication you know and one of the things you know the technical aspects on that is there was a jabber server that was that's a communication type of communication server that was being used and we knew that ross would had his jabber set to pacific time so we had a pretty good idea what what part of the the we what part of the country he was in i mean isn't that from from dpr's perspective from russ' perspective isn't that clumsy he wasn't a a a he wasn't a big computer guy do you notice that aspect of like the technical savvy of some of these guys doesn't seem to be quite why why weren't they good at this well the the real techy savvy ones we don't arrest we don't get to them we don't find them get to them shout out to the techie criminals they're probably watching this i mean yeah i mean you were getting the low hanging fruit i mean you're getting the ones that can be caught i mean they they you know well i'm sure we'll talk about it but the anonymous case there was a guy named av unit he's still i lose sleep over him because i we didn't catch him we called everybody else we didn't catch him he's good though he pops up too once in a while on the internet and it pisses me off yeah what's his name again av unit that's all i know is his av unit av unit yeah i got a funny story about about him and what who people think he is can i actually can we go on that brief tangent sure i love tangents well let me ask you since he's probably he or she do we know it's a he we have no idea okay that's another funny story about hackers the he she issue what's the funny story there well one of the guys in lulzsec was a was a she it was a seventeen year old girl yeah and my source in the case the the guy sabu that i arrested and part of it you know we sat side by side for nine months and then took down you know the case and all that he was convinced she was a girl and was that you know and he he was in love with her almost at at one point it turns out to be a thirty five year old guy living in england oh so he was convinced as a a a yes he was absolutely based on what exactly by linguistic like human based linguistic analysis or what she she he whatever you know kayla is what we went which ended up being like a a modification of his sister's name the real real guy's sister's name got it was so good at building the backstory all these guys and it and it's funny like these guys are part of a hacking crew they social engineer the shit out of each other yeah just to build if one of them ever gets caught they'll convince the everybody else that you know they're a brazilian you know isp owner or something like that and that's how i'm so powerful well yeah that social engineering aspect is part of living a life of cybercrime or cybersecurity on the offensive or defensive so av unit can't get also just a a tangent of a tangent first that's my favorite tangent okay is it possible for me to have a podcast conversation with somebody who hasn't been caught yet and because they have the conversation they still won't be caught and is that a good idea meaning is there a safe way for a criminal to talk to me on a podcast i would think so i would think they that that someone could i mean someone who has been living a double life for for long enough where you think they're not a criminal i no no no they would have to admit that they they would say i am av unit oh you would wanna have a conversation with av unit yes is there a way i'm just speaking from an fbi perspective technically speaking because i i so let let me explain my motivation i think i would like to be able to talk to people from all walks of life and understanding criminals understanding their mind i think is very important and i think there's fundamentally something different between a criminal who's still active versus one that's been caught the mind just from observing it changes completely once you're caught you you have the big shift in your understanding of the world i mean the i do have a question about the ethics of having such conversations but first technically sure is is that is it possible if i was advising you i would say first off don't advertise it don't the fewer people that you're gonna tell that you're having this conversation with the better and yeah you could did you do it in person or are you doing it in person would be amazing yeah but they their face would not be shown face would not be shown yeah i mean you couldn't publish a show for a while they'd have to put a lot of trust in you that you are not going to you're gonna have to alter those tapes mhmm i say tapes because it's old school the opt you know it's a tape exactly i'm sure a lot of people just said that like oh shit this old guy just said tape i heard of vhs it was in eighteen hundreds i think but yeah yeah you could do it they they'd have to have complete faith and trust in you that you destroy the originals after you've altered it what about if they don't have faith is there a way for them to attain security so like for me to go through some kind of process where i meet them somewhere where i i mean you're not gonna do it without a bag over your head i don't know if that's the life you wanna live i'm fine with a bag over my head that's gonna take get taken out of context but i just i think it's a worthy effort it's a worth it's worthy to go through the hardship of that to understand the mind of somebody i think fundamentally conversations are a different thing than the operation of law enforcement understanding the mind of a criminal i think is really important i don't know if you're gonna have the honest conversation that you're looking for i mean it may sound honest but it may not be the truth i found most times when i was talking to criminals it's lies mixed with half truths and you you kinda it's if they're good they can keep that story going for long enough if they're not you know you kind of see the relief in them when you finally break that wall down that's the job of an interviewer if the interviewer is good then perhaps not directly but through the gaps seeps out the truth of the human being so not necessarily the details of how they do the operations and so on but just who they are as a human being what their motivations are what their ethics are how they see the world what is good what is evil do they see themselves as good what do they see their motivation as do they have resentment what do they think about love for the people within their small community do they have resentment for the government or for other nations or for other people do they have childhood issues that led to to a different view of the world than others perhaps have do they have certain fetishes like sexual and otherwise that led to the construction of the world they might be able to reveal some deep flaws to the cybersecurity infrastructure of our world not in detail but like philosophically speaking they might have i i know you might say it's just a narrative but they might have a kind of ethical concern for the well-being of the world that they're essentially attacking the weakness of the cybersecurity infrastructure because they believe ultimately that would lead to a safer world so the attacks will reveal the weaknesses and if they're stealing a bunch of money that's okay because that's gonna enforce you to invest a lot more money in defending yeah defending things that actually matter you know nuclear warheads and all those kinds of things i mean i could i could see if you know it's fascinating to explore the mind of a human being like that because i think it will help people understand now of course it's still a person that's creating a lot of suffering in the world which is a problem so do you think ethically it's a good thing to do i don't i mean i i feel like i have a fairly high ethical bar that i have to put myself on and i don't think i have a problem with it i would love to listen to it okay great i i mean not that i'm your ethical coach here yeah but well that's interesting i mean be so because i thought you would have become jaded and exhausted by the criminal mind it's funny you know i i'm i'm you know fast forward in our story i'm very good friends with with hector monserier the sabu the guy i arrested and he tells stories of what he did in his past and i'm like that hector you know oh you know but then i listened to your episode with brett johnson and i was like this guy stealing money from from the us government and welfare fraud and all these sort of things it just pissed me off and i don't know why i have that differentiation in my head i don't know why i think one's just oh hector will be hector and then this guy just pissed me off well you didn't feel that way about hector until you probably met him well i didn't know hector i knew sabu so i hunted down sabu and i learned about hector over those nine months we'll we'll talk about it let's finish with hey let's return tangent to back to tangent oh run tangent up who's av unit i don't know interesting so he's at the core of anonymous he's one of the critical people anonymous what is known about him there's what's known in public and what was known because he sat with hector and he was sort of like the the set things up guy so if lulzsec had like their hackers which was sabu and kayla and they had their their their media guy sky topiary he lived up in the northern end of england and they had a few other guys but but avion was the guy that set up infrastructure so if you need a vpn in brazil or something like that to pop through one of the first things hector told me after we arrested him is that havi unit was a secret service agent and i was like oh shit just because he kinda lived that lifestyle he'd be around for a bunch of days and then all of a sudden gone for three weeks and i i try to get more out of hector but but that early on in that relationship you know i'm sure he was a little bit guarded maybe trying to social engineer me maybe he wanted that that oh shit there's law enforcement involved in this and and not to say i mean i i was in over my head with that case just the amount of work that was going on so to track them all down plus the three hundred and fifty hacks that came in about just military institutions you know it was swimming in the deep end so it was just at the end of the case i looked back and i was like oh fuck amy unick i coulda had them all you know maybe that's the perfectionist in me oh man well reach out somehow i can't i won't say how right we'll have to figure out would you have him on yeah oh my gosh if if you just let me know just just talk a little bit about you the whole time that's perfect he probably doesn't even care about me but well now he will oh yeah because there's a certain pleasure of a guy who's extremely good at his job not catching another guy who's extremely good at his job obviously better he got away better there you go he's still eating at you i love it yeah so you or she if i can meet that guy one day that or he he or she that'd be great i mean i have no power so yes silk road can you speak to the scale of this thing what what just for people who are not familiar how big was it and any other interesting things you understand about its operation when it was active so it was when we finally got looking through the books and you know the the numbers came out it's about one point two billion dollars in sales it's kinda hard with the fluctuation value of bitcoin at the time to come up with a real number so you kind of pick a daily average you know and go across so most of the operation was done in in bitcoin it's all done in bitcoin you you couldn't you had escrow accounts on you know you came in and you put money in an escrow account and you know it the transaction wasn't done until the client got the the drugs or whatever they had bought and then the drug dealers had had sent it in there was some talk at the time that that the cartel was starting to sell on there so that started getting a little hairy there at the end what was the understanding of the relationship between organized crime like the cartels and this kind of more ad hoc new age market that is the silk road i mean it was all just chatter it was just you know because like i said jared was in the inside so we saw some of it from the admin sides and ross had a lot of private conversations with different people that he advised him but no one knew each other and i mean the only thing the only thing that that they knew were the admins had to send an id to ross had to send a picture of their driver's license or passport which i always found very strange because if you are an admin on a site that sells fake ids mhmm why would you send your real id and then why would the guy running the site who profits from selling fake ids believe that it was but fast forward yeah tangent they were all real ids all the ids that we found on ross's computer as the admins were the real people's ids what do you make of that just kind of other clumsiness yeah low hanging fruit i guess i guess that's what it is i mean i mean i would have bought i mean even ross bought fake ids off the site he had federal agents knock on his door you know and then he got a little cocky about it the landscape the dynamics of trust is fascinating here so you trust certain ideas or like who do you trust in that kind of market what was your understanding of the network of trust i don't think anyone trust anybody you know i mean i think ross had his advisers of trust but outside of that i mean he required people to send their id for their trust he you know people stole from him there was there's open cases of that it's a criminal world you can't trust anybody what was his life like you think lonely can you you imagine being trapped in something like that where you the your whole world focus on that and you can't tell people what you do all day could he have walked away like someone else take over or the site just shut down either one just you put putting yourself in his shoes the loneliness the the anxiety the just the growing immensity of it so walk away with some kind of financial stability i couldn't have made it past two days i i'm not a low i don't like loneliness yeah i mean my i if my wife's away i probably call her ten twelve times a day we just talk about things you know i just you know something crossed my mind i wanna talk about it and i'm sure she and you like to talk to her like honestly about everything so if you were running so crotus you you wouldn't be able to like hopefully i'd have a little protection i'd only mention to her when we're in bed to have that marital connection but but who knows i mean she's gonna question why the ferrari is outside and and things like that yeah well i'm sure you can come up with something why didn't he walk away it's another question of why don't criminals walk away in these situations well i i mean i don't know every criminal mind and some do i mean av unit walked away i mean not to go back to that son of a bitch but there's a theme to this but you know ross started counting his dollars i mean he really kept track of how much money he was making and and it started you know getting exponentially growth i mean he i mean if he would've stayed at it he would've probably been one of the richest people in the world and do you think he liked the actual money or the fact of the number growing i mean have you ever held a bitcoin yeah oh you have well he never what do you mean held a bitcoin he can't hold it it's not real oh it's not like i can give you a briefcase of bitcoin right like you know or something like that like he liked the idea of it growing he liked the idea i mean i think it started off as sharing this idea but then he really did turn to like i am the captain of the ship and that's what goes and he was making a lot of money and again my interactions with ross was about maybe five or six hours over a over a two day period i knew dpr because i read his words and all that i didn't really know ross there was a journal found on his computer and so it sort of kinda gave me a little insight so i don't like to do a playbook for criminals but i'll tell you right now don't write things down there was a big fad about people like remember kids going around shooting people with paintballs and filming it mhmm i don't know why you would do that why would you videotape yourself committing crime and then publish it like if there's one thing i've taught my children don't record yourself doing bad things it never goes back goes well so and you actually give advice in the other end of logs being very useful for the defense perspective for you know information is useful for being able to figure out what the attacks were all about logs are the only reason i found hector monsignore i mean the the one time his vpn dropped during a a fox hack and i he says he did it wasn't even hacking he just was sent a link and he clicked on it and in ten million lines of of logs there was one ip address that stuck out this is fascinating we'll we'll explore several angles of that so what was the process of bringing down ros and the silk road alright so that's a long story you want the whole thing or you wanna break it up let's start at the beginning once we had the information of the chat logs and all that from the server we found the server what's the chat log so the dot onion was running the the website the silk road was running on a server in iceland how did you figure that out that's one of the claims that the nsa yeah that's that's that's the one that that we said that that yeah i wouldn't tell you if it was it's on the internet i mean the internet has their conspiracy theories and all that so but you figure out that's the part of the thing you do you it's puzzle pieces and you have to put them together yeah and look for different pieces of information and figure out okay so you figure out the server is in iceland we get a copy of it and so we start getting clues off of that and we wait a physical copy of the server yeah we flew you you fly over there so you you go if you've been to iceland if you've never been you should definitely go to iceland is it beautiful or i love it i love it it was what so i'll tell you this so sorry tangents we you know i i i love this yeah so i went to iceland for the anonymous case then i went to iceland for the silk road case and i was like oh shit all cybercrime goes through iceland it was just my sort of thing and i was over there for like the third time and i said if i ever can bring my family here like so there's a place called thingavar and i'm sure i'm fucking up the name the icelandics are pissed right now but it's where the the north american continental plate and the european continental plate are pulling apart and it's being filled in with volcanic material in the in the middle and it's so cool like i was like one day i'll be able to afford to bring my family here and and once i left just like the humbling and the beauty of nature just everything man it was a different world it was it was it was insane how great iceland is and so we went back and we we rented a van and then we took friends and we drove around the entire country absolutely like a a beautiful place like reykjavik's nice but get out of reykjavik as quick as you can and see the countryside how is this place even real well it's so new i mean that's so you know our rivers have been going through here for millions of years and flattened everything out and all that the these are these are new this is new land being carved by these rivers you can walk behind a waterfall in one place it's it's it's the most brutal place i've ever been do you understand why this is a place where a lot of hacking is being done because the energy is free and it's it's cool so you have a lot of servers going on there server farms you know they're they're the energy has come up out out of the ground geothermal and so and then it keeps all the servers nice and cool so why not keep your computers there at a cheap rate i'll i'll definitely visit for several reasons including to talk to av unit yeah he'll get you there well the servers are there but they don't probably live there i mean that's interesting i mean the pacific the pst the time zones it's pretty there's so many fascinating things to explore here well but so you got sorry to add to that the i mean the european internet cable goes through there so you know across the the greenland and down through canada and all that so they have backbone access with cheap energy and free cold weather you know so and beautiful oh and beautiful yes so chat logs on that server what are what are the what are what was in the chat logs everything he kept them all that's another issue if you're running a criminal enterprise please don't keep again i'm not making a guidebook of how to commit the horrific crime but you know we every chat that you ever had and everyone's chat it was it was like going into facebook of criminal activity yeah i've just looking at texts with elon musk being part of the conversations i don't know if you're familiar but they've been made public for the court cases going through was going through is going through was going through with twitter i don't know where it is but it made me realize that oh okay i'm generally that's my philosophy in life is like anything i text or email or say publicly or privately i should be proud of so i tried to kinda do that because you basically you say don't keep chat logs but it's very difficult to erase chat logs from this world like i guess if you're a criminal that should be like you have to be exceptionally competent at that kind of thing to erase your footprints is very very difficult can't make one mistake all it takes is one mistake of keeping it but but yeah i mean not only do you have to be whatever you put in a chat log or whatever you put in an email it has to hold up and you have to be stand behind publicly when it comes out but it has if it comes out ten years from now you have to stand behind it i mean we're seeing that now in today's society yeah but that's a responsibility you have to take really really seriously if like if i was a parent and advising teens like you kinda have to teach them that i i i know there's a sense like no we'll become more accustomed to that kind of thing but in reality no i think in the future we'll still be held responsible for the weird shit we do yeah a friend of mine his daughter got kicked out of college because of something she posted in high school and the shittiest thing for him but great for my kids great lesson look over there and you don't want that to happen to you yeah okay so in the chat logs was useful information like breadcrumbs of what of information that you can then pull out yeah great evidence and stuff you know i mean obviously evidence too yeah a lot of evidence i mean here we go i here's a a sale of this much heroin because you know ross ended up getting charged with the tsar status on certain things and that's there there's it's a certain weight in each each type of drug that you had like i think it was it's four or five employees of your empire and that you made more than ten million dollars and so it's it's it's you know it's just like the the narco track feeders get charged with or you know anybody out of colombia you know so and that was primarily what he was charged with during when he was arrested is the drug yeah and he got charged with some of the hacking tools too okay like because he's in prison what for two life life sentences plus forty years and no possibility of parole in the federal system there's no possibility of parole when you have life the only way you get out is if the president pardons you there's always a chance there there is i think it was close i heard i heard rumors that it was close well right so it depends given it's fascinating but given the political the ideological ideas that he represented and espoused it's it's not out of the realm of possibility yeah i mean i've been asked before who you know who does does he get out of prison first or does snowden come back into america and i i don't know i have no idea just became a russian citizen i saw that and that's yeah i've heard a lot of good weird theories about that one well actually on another tangent let me ask you do you think snowden is a good or a bad person a bad person can you make the case that he's a bad person there's ways of being a whistleblower and and there there's there's rules set up on how to do that he he didn't follow those rules i mean they they you know i'm red white and blue so i i'm pretty you know i i was a actions were anti american i think the results of his actions were anti american i don't know if his were anti american think he could have anticipated the the negative consequences of that his action yes should we judge him by the consequences or the ideals of the intent of his actions i think we all get to judge him by best our own beliefs but i believe what he did was wrong can you steel man the case that he is actually a good person and good for this country for the united states of america as a flag bearer for the the whistleblowers the the check on the power of government yeah i mean i i'm not big government type guy you know so you know even that sounds weird coming from a government guy for so many years but there's rules in place for a reason i mean he put you know some of our best capabilities he made them publicly available it really kinda set us back in the and and this isn't my world at all but the offensive side of of cybersecurity right so he revealed stuff that he didn't need to reveal in in order to make the point correct the so so you if you can imagine a world where he leaked stuff that revealed the mass surveillance efforts and not reveal other stuff like is is the mass surveillance i mean that's the thing that of course there's in the interpretation of that there's fear mongering but at the core that was a real shock to people that it's possible for government to collect data at scale it's surprising to me that people are that shocked by it well there's conspiracies and then there's like actual evidence that that is happening i mean it's a it's a real there's a lot of reality that people ignore but when it hits you in the face you realize holy shit we're living in a new world this is this is the new reality and we have to deal with that reality just like you work in cybersecurity i think it really hasn't hit most people how fucked we all are in terms of cybersecurity okay let me rephrase that how many dangers there are in a digital world how much under attack we all are and how more intense the attacks are getting and how difficult the defense is and how important it is and how much we should value it and all the different things we should do at the small and large scale to defend like most people really haven't woken up they think about privacy from tech companies they don't think about attacks cyberattacks people don't think they're a target and it's that message definitely has to get out there i mean you know if you have a voice you're a target if the place you work you might be a target you know so your husband might work at some place you know and they because now people are working from home so so they're gonna target you know target you to get access to to his network in order to get in well in that same way the idea that the us government or any government could be doing mass surveillance on its citizens is is one that was a wake up call because you could imagine the ways in which that could be like you could abuse the power of that to control a citizenry for political reasons and purposes absolutely you know you could abuse it i i think during the part of the snowden league saw that two nsa guys were moderating like their girlfriends yeah and there's rules in place for that those people should be punished for abusing that but how else are we going to hear about you know terrorists that are in the country talking about birthday cakes and you know that was a case where that that was the trip word that that you know we're gonna go and bomb new york city's subway yeah it's it's complicated but it just feels like there should be some balance of transparency there should be a check-in that power because like you you know in the name of the war on terror you you can sort of sacrifice there is a trade opportunity in security and freedom but it just feels like there's a giant slippery slope on the sacrificing of freedom in the name of security i i hear you and and you know we we live in a world where well i live in a world where i had to tell you exactly how when i arrested someone i had to write a a fifty page document of how i arrested you and all the probable cause i have against you and all that well you know bad guys are reading that they're reading how i caught you and they're changing the way they're doing things they're changing their mo you know they're doing it to be more secure if you know we tell people how we're monitoring you know how what we're surveilling we're gonna lose that i mean the the the tariffs are just gonna go a different way and i'm not trying to again i'm not big government i'm not trying to say that you know it's cool that that that we're monitoring the us government's monitoring everything know big tech's monitoring everything they're they're just monetizing it versus possibly using it against you but there is a balance and those fifty pages they have a lot of value they make your job harder but they prevent you from abusing the power of the job yeah there's a balance yeah that's a tricky balance so the chat logs in iceland gave you evidence of the heroin and all the the large scale czar level drug trading what else did it give you in terms of the how to catch it gave us infrastructure so the onion name was actually running on a server in france so if you like and it only commuted through a a back channel a vpn to connect to the iceland server there was a bitcoin like kind of vault server that was also in iceland and i think that was so that the admins couldn't get into the bitcoins the other admins that were hired to work on the site so you could get into the site but you couldn't touch the money only ross had access to that and then you know another another big mistake on ross's part is he had the backups for everything at a data center in philadelphia don't put your infrastructure in united states i mean again let's not make a playbook but you know well i i think these are low hanging fruit that people of competence would know already yeah i agree but it's interesting that he wasn't competent enough to make so he was incompetent in certain ways yeah i don't i don't think he was a mastermind of setting up an an infrastructure that would protect his his his online business because you know keeping chat logs keeping a diary putting infrastructure where it shouldn't be bad decisions how did you figure out that he is in san francisco so we had that part with jared that he was on the west coast and then who again is jared jared dayaghan was a he was a partner in he he was a dhs agent worked for hsi homeland security investigations in chicago he started his silk road investigation because he was working at o'hare and a weird package came in come to find out he traced it back to silk road so he he he started working at a silk road investigation long before i started my case and he made his way up undercover all the way to be an admin on silk road so he was talking to ross on a jabber server the private jabber server private chat communication server and we noticed that ross's time zone on that jabber server was set to the west coast so we we had pacific time on there so we had a a region one twenty fourth of the world was covered of where we thought we might be and from there how do you get to san francisco there was another guy an irs agent that was part of the team and he used a powerful tool to find his clue he used the world of google yeah he simply just went back and googled around for silk road at the time it was coming up and found some posts on like some help forums that this guy was starting an onion website and wanted some cryptocurrency help and if you could help him please reach out to ross dot albrick at gmail dot com in my world that that's a clue so okay so that that's as simple as that yeah and the the name he used on that post was frosty yeah so he had to connect frosty and other uses in frosty and here's a gmail and the gmail has the name the gmail posted that that i need help under the name frosty on this forum so what's the connection of frosty elsewhere the person logging into the philadelphia backup server the name of the computer was frosty yeah another clue in my world and that's it the name is there the connection to the philadelphia server and then to iceland is there and so the rest is small details in terms of or is there interesting details no i mean there's some electronic surveillance that that find ross albrecht living in a house and is there you know is a computer at his house attaching to you know does it have tor traffic at the same time the dpr is on another big clue matching up time frames again just putting your email out there putting your name out there like that like what i see from that just at the scale of that market what what i what it just makes me wonder how many criminals are out there that are not making these low hanging fruit mistakes and are still successfully operating to me it seems like you could be a criminal much it's much easier to be a criminal on the internet what else to you is interesting to understand about that case of russ and and silk road and just the history of it from your own relationship with it from a cybersecurity perspective from an ethical perspective all that kind of stuff like when you look back what what's interesting to you about that case i think my views on the case have changed over time i mean it was my job back then so i just looked at it as of you know i'm going after this i sort of made a name for myself in the bureau for the anonymous case and then this one was just i mean this was a bigger deal i mean they flew me down to dc to meet with the director about this case the president of the united states was gonna announce this case the arrest unfortunately the government shut down two days before so it was just us and and that's really the only reason i had any publicity out of it is because the government shut down and the only thing that went public was that affidavit with my signature at the end otherwise it would've just been the the attorney general and the president announcing the rest of this this big thing and you wouldn't have seen me did you understand that this was a big case yeah i knew it the yeah they knew it the time was it because of the scale of it or what it stood for i just knew that the public was gonna react gonna react in a big way like the media was now did i think that it was gonna be on the front page of every newspaper in the the day after the arrest no but i could sense it like i went like three or four days without sleep when i was out in san francisco to arrest ross i had sent three guys to iceland to so it was a three pronged approach for the takedown it was get ross get the bitcoins and seize the site like we didn't want someone else taking control of the site and we wanted that big splash of that banner like look look the government found this site like you might not wanna think about doing this again so and you were able to pull off all three maybe that's my superpower i'm really good about putting smarter people on than than i am together and on the right things you know i've i've done the only way to do it in the business i formed that's what i did i hired only smarter people than me and i you know i'm not that smart but you know smart enough to know who the smart people are the team was able to do all three yeah we were able to get all three done yeah and the one guy one of the guys the main guys i sent to iceland man he was so smart like i sent another guy from the fbi to to france to get that part and he couldn't do it so the guy in iceland did it from from iceland they had to pull some stuff out of memory on a computer you know it's live process stuff i'm sure you've done that before but i'm sure you did look look what you're doing you're this is a it's like a a multilayer interrogation going on was there a concern that somebody else would step in and control the site absolutely we we we didn't have insight on who exactly i'd control so it turns out that ross had like dictatorial control so he it wasn't easy to delegate to somebody else he hadn't i think he had some sort of ideas i mean his diary talked about walking away and giving it to somebody else but he he didn't he couldn't give up that control with anybody apparently which makes you think that power corrupts and his ideals were not as strong as he espoused about because if if it was about the the freedom of being able to buy drugs if you want to then he surely should have found ways to delegate that power well he changed over time you could see it in his writings that he changed like so people argue back and forth that there was never murders on silk road when we were doing the investigation to us there were six murders so there there was the way we see him saw him at the time was ross ordered people to be murdered you know somebody people stole from him and all that it was sort of an evolution from oh man i can't deal with this i can't do it it's too much to the last one was like the guy said well he's got three roommates and it's like oh we'll kill them too was that ever proven in court no because it's a murder the the murders never went forward because there was some some some stuff problems in that case so there was a separate case in baltimore that they had been working on for a lot longer and so you know during the investigation that caused a bunch of problems because now we have multiple federal agencies case against the same thing how do you decide not to push forward the the the the murder investigations so there was a deconfliction meeting that happened in dc i didn't happen to go to that meeting but jared went this is before i ever knew jared and we have like televisions where we can just sit in a room and sit sit in on the meeting but it's all you know secured network and all that so we can talk openly about secure things and we sat in on the meeting and people just kept saying the term sweat equity i've got sweat equity meaning that they had worked on the case for so long that they deserve to take him down and the by this time you know no one knew about us but we told him at the meeting that well we had found the server and we have a copy of it and we have the infrastructure and and these guys had just had communications undercovers they didn't really know what was going on and this wasn't my first deconfliction meeting we had a huge deconfliction meeting during during the anonymous case what's the deconfliction mean agents within your agency or other other federal agencies have an open investigation that if you expose your case or took down your case would hurt their case or the other day oh so you kinda have a it's it's like the rival gangs meet at the table in a smoke filled room and less bullets at the end but yes oh boy with the sweat equity yeah so i mean there's co careers at stake right yeah yeah you hate that idea yeah i mean why would you why is that at stake just because you've worked on it long enough longer than i have that means you get you you you did better yeah that's that's insane to me the the the rewarding bad behavior and so that one the part of the sweat equity discussion was about murder and this was here's a chance to actually bust them be given the data you have from iceland iceland and all that kind of stuff so why well they wanted us just to turn the data over to them to them yeah so that thanks thanks for getting us this far here it is i mean it came to the point where they sent us like they they had a picture of what they thought ross was and it was an internet meme it really was a meme it was a it was a photo that we could look up like it it was insane alright so there's different degrees of competence all across the world between different people yes okay does part of you regret because you pushed forward the the heroin and the drug trade we never got to the murder discussion i mean the only regret in is that the the internet doesn't seem to understand like they they they just kinda blow that part off that that he literally paid people to have people murdered it didn't result in a murder and i think god no one resulted in a murder but that's where his mind was his mind and where he wrote in his diary was that i had people killed and here's the money he paid it he he paid a large amount of bitcoins to to for that murder so if those murders he didn't just even think about it he actually took action but the murders never happened he took action by paying the money correct and the and the people came back with results he thought they were murdered that said can you understand the steel man the case for the drug trade on silk road like making can you make the case that it's a net positive for society so there was a time period of when we found out the infrastructure and when we built the case against ross i don't remember exact six weeks a month two months i don't know somewhere in there but then at ross's sentencing there was a father that stood up and talked about his son dying and i went back and kinda did the math and it was between those time periods of when we knew we could shut it down we could've pulled the plug on the server and gone and when ross was arrested his son died from buying drugs on silk road and i still think about that father a lot but if we look at scale at the war on drugs let's just even outside of silk road do you think the war on drugs by the united states has caused has alleviated more suffering or caused more suffering in the world that might be above my pay scale i mean i understand the other side of the argument i mean people said that i don't have to go down to the corner to buy drugs i'm not gonna get shot on the corner buying drugs or something i can just have them sent to my house people are gonna do drugs anyways i understand that argument from my personal standpoint if i made it more difficult for my children to get drugs then i'm satisfied so your personal philosophy is that if we legalize all drugs including heroin and cocaine that that would not make for a better world i don't no personally i don't believe legalizing all drugs would make make for a better world can you imagine that it would do you understand that argument sure i mean as i've gotten older i've started to i like to see both sides of an argument and and when i can't see the other side i that's when i really like to dive into it and i can see the other side i can see the why people would say that but i don't wanna be my group raise children in a world where where drugs are just free for for use well and then the other side of it is with silk road did you know taking down silk road did that increase or decrease the number of drug trading criminals in the world it's unclear online i think it increased i think you know that that's one of the things i think about a lot with silk road was that no one really knew i mean there there was you know thousands of users but then after that it was on the front page of the paper and there was millions of people that knew about tor and and onion sites we it was an advertisement you know i would have thought i thought crypto was gonna crash right after that like i don't know like what people have now see that bet bad people are doing bad things with crypto that'll crash more i'm obviously wrong on that one and i thought you know ross was sentenced to two life sentences plus forty years no one's gonna start up these dark markets exploded after that yeah you know some of them started as you know opportunistic i'm gonna you know take those escrow accounts and i'm gonna steal all the all the money that came in you know they were with that but you know but there were a lot of dark markets that popped up after that now we do we put the playbook out there yeah yeah but and also there's a case for do you ever think about not taking down if you have not taken down silk road you could use it because it's a market it itself is not necessarily the primary criminal organization it's a market for criminals so it could be used to track down criminals in the physical world so if you don't take it down given that it was you know the central how centralized it was it could be used as a place to find criminals right so the dealers the drug dealer take it out of the dealers yeah so if you have the card get the cartels start getting involved you you go after the dealers it would have been very difficult because of tour and all that all the productions anonymity decloaking all that would have been drastically more difficult and a lot of people in upper management of the fbi didn't have the appetite of running something like that that would have been the fbi running a drug market how many how many kids how many fathers would have had to come in and said my kid bought while the fbi was running a site a drug site my kid died so i didn't know anybody in the fbi in management that would have the appetite to let us run what was happening on silk road you know because remember that time we're still believing six people are dead we're still investigating you know where are all these bodies you know that's pretty much why we took down ross when we did i mean we we had to jump on it fast what else can you say about this complicated world that has grown of the dark web i don't understand it i i like it would have been something for me i i thought i thought it was gonna collapse but i mean it's just gotten bigger in what's going out there now i'm really surprised in in that it hasn't grown into other networks or people haven't developed other networks but but tor like instead of tor yeah yeah yeah yeah tor's still the main one out there i mean there's some there's a few others and i'm not not gonna put an advertisement out for them but but you know i thought that market would have grown yeah my sense was when i interacted with tory was that there's huge usability issues but that's for like legal activity yeah because like if you care about privacy it's just not as good of a browser like it's to to to to look at stuff no it's way too slow it's way too slow but i mean you can't even like i know some people would use it to like view movies like netflix you can only view certain movies in certain countries you can use it for that but it's it's too slow even for that so were you ever able to hold in your mind the landscape of the dark web like what what's going on out there it's just to me as a human being it's just difficult to understand the digital world like these anonymous usernames like doing anonymous activity it's just it's hard to what am i trying to say it's hard to visualize it in the way i can visualize like i've been reading a lot about hitler i can visualize meetings between people military strategy deciding on certain evil atrocities all that kind of stuff i can visualize the people there's agreements hands handshakes stuff signed groups built like in the digital space like with bots with anonymity anyone human can be multiple people it's just yeah it's all lies it's all lies like yeah it feels like i can't trust anything no you can't you honestly can't and like you can talk to two different people and it's the same person like like there's so many different you know hector had so many different identities online the you know of things that that you know the the lies to each other i mean he lied to people inside his group just to use another name to spy on make sure what they're you know were talking shit behind his back or weren't doing anything it's all lies and and people that can keep all those lies straight it's unbelievable to me ross albrecht represents the very early days of that that's why the the confidence wasn't there just imagine how good the people are now the kids that grow up oh they've learned from his his mistakes just the extreme confidence you just see how good people are at video games like the level of play in terms of video games like i i used to think i sucked and now i'm not even like i'm not even in the like consideration of calling myself shitty at video games i'm not even i'm like nonexistent i'm like the mold yeah i stopped playing because it's so embarrassing it's embarrassing it's like wrestling with your kid and he finally beats you he's like well fuck that i'm not wrestling my kid any or ever again and in some sense hacking at its best and its worst is a kind of game and you can get exceptionally good at that kind of game and you get the accolades of it i mean there there there's you know there's power that comes along if you have success look at the kid that that was hacking into uber and rockstar games he put it out there that he was doing it i mean he used the name whatever hacked into uber was his screen name he's very proud of it i mean one building evidence against himself but you know they they he wanted that slap on the back like look at what a great hacker you are yeah what do you think is in the mind of that guy what do you think is in the mind of of russ do you think they see themselves as good people oh do they do do you think they acknowledge the bad they're doing onto the world so so that uber hacker i think that's just you thing not realizing what consequences are i mean based on his actions ross was a little bit older i think i'd ross truly is a libertarian he was truly had his beliefs that that he could provide the gateway for other people to live that libertarian lifestyle and put in their body what they want i i don't think that was a a front or a lie what what's the difference between dpr and ross you said like i have never met ross until i have only had those two two two days of worth of interaction yeah it's just it's just interesting given how long you've chased him and then having met him what was the difference to you as a human being he he was a human being he was he was you know he was an actual person he was nervous when i when we arrested him so one of the things that that i i learned through my law enforcement career is if i'm gonna be the case agent i'm gonna be the one in charge of you know dealing with this person i'm not putting handcuffs on him somebody else is gonna do that like i'm gonna be there to help him you know i'm your conduit to help and so you know right after someone's arrested you you obviously have had them down for weapons to make sure for everybody's safety but then i just put my hand on their chest just feel their heart feel their breathing you're gonna it's it's i'm sure it's the scariest day yeah but then to have that human contact kind of settles people down and you kinda let let's start thinking about this i'm gonna tell you you know i'm gonna be open and honest with you you know there's a lot of cops out there and federal agents' cops that just go to the hard ass tactic you don't get very far with that you don't get very far being a mean asshole to somebody you know be compassionate be human and it's gonna go a lot further so given everything he's done you were still able to have compassion for him yeah we took him to the jail and we we so he it was after hours so so he didn't get to see a judge that day so he stick we stuck him in the san francisco jail i hadn't slept for about four days because i was dealing with the people in iceland bosses in dc bosses in new york so i and i was in san francisco so time frame like like the iceland people were calling me when i was supposed to be sleeping it was insane but i still went out that night while ross sat in jail and bought him breakfast i said what do you want for breakfast i'll have a nice breakfast for you because we picked him up in the morning and took him over to the fbi to do the the fbi booking the fingerprints and all that and and i got him breakfast i mean and you don't get paid back for that sort of thing i'm not looking but out of my own did he make special requests for breakfast yeah he asked for certain things what can you mention or is that top secret fbi not top secret i i i think you wanted some granola bars like and and and you know but but i mean he already had lawyered up so we you know which is his right he can do that so i i knew we weren't gonna work together you know like i did with hector but i mean this is so most of the conversations stay most of the conversations have to be them with lawyers from that point on i can't question him yeah when he asked for a lawyer or if i did it couldn't be used against him yeah so we just had conversation where i talked to him yeah you know he could you know could could say things to me but then i would remind him that he asked for a lawyer and he'd have to waive that and all that but we didn't talk about his case so much we just talked about like human beings did he with his eyes with his words reveal any kind of regret or did you see a human being changing understanding something about themselves in the process of being caught no i i don't i don't think that i mean you did offer me twenty million dollars to let him go when we were drive god when we were driving to the the jail oh no and and i asked him what i was gonna we were gonna do with the agent that sat in the front seat the money really broke him i think so i think he kind of got caught up in how much money it was and and how you know when crypto started it was pennies and by the time he got arrested it was a hundred and twenty bucks and you know the the you know a hundred and seventy seven thousand bitcoins even today you know that's a lot of bitcoins so you really could have been if you continued to be one of the richest people in the world i i possibly could have been if i took that that twenty billion then i could have been living we could have this conversation in venezuela in a castle in a palace yeah until it runs out and then and then the government storms the castle yeah have you talked to russ since no no i i would i'd be open to it i don't think he probably wants to hear from me and do you know where in which prison he is i think he's somewhere out in arizona i know he was in the one next to supermax for a little while like the the high security one that's like shares the fence with supermax but i don't think he's there anymore i think he's out in arizona i i haven't seen in a while i wonder if you can do interviews in prison that'd be nice some some people are allowed to so i don't i don't i've not seen an interview with him i know people have wanted to interview him about books and that sort of thing right because the story really blew up did it surprise you how much the story and many elements of it blew up movies it it did surprise me like it my wife's uncle who i didn't i've been married to my wife for twenty two years now i don't think he knew my name and he he was excited about that he reached out when when silk road came out so he he you know that was surprising to see did you think the movie was on the on the topic was good i didn't have anything to do with that movie i've watched it once it was kinda cool that jimmy simpson you know was my name in the movie but outside of that i thought it it sort of missed the mark on some things well in hollywood i i don't think they understand what's interesting about these kinds of stories and there's a lot of things that are interesting and they missed all of them so for example i recently talked to john carmack alright who's a world class developer and so on so hollywood would think that the interesting thing about john carmack is some kinda like shitty like a parody of a hacker or something like that that would show like really crappy like emulation of some kinda linux terminal thing the reality is like the technical details for five hours with him for ten hours with him is what people actually wanna see even people that don't program they want to see a brilliant mind the the details that they're not they even if they don't understand all the details they want to have an inkling of the genius there that's just one way i'm saying like that that you wanna reveal the the the genius the complexity of that world in interesting ways and to make a hollywood almost parody caricature of it it just destroys the spirit of the thing so one the operation fbi is fascinating just tracking down these people the on the cybersecurity front is fascinating the other is just how you run tor how you run this kind of organization the trust issues of the different criminal entities involved the anonymity the the low hanging fruit the being shitty at certain parts in on the technical front all of those are fascinating things and you know that's that's what a movie should reveal should probably be a series honestly a netflix series than a movie yeah maybe one of the an fx show or something like that because they were kinda gritty you know yeah yeah gritty yeah exactly gritty i mean shows like chernobyl from hbo made me realize okay you can do a good job of a difficult story and and like reveal the human side but also reveal the technical side and have some deeper fond understanding on that case on the bureaucracy of a of a of a soviet regime in this case you could reveal the bureaucracy the chaos of a criminal organization of a law enforcement organization i mean there's so much to like explore it's fascinating i don't know yeah i like to know but like i when i rewatch it i can't watch episode three though the the the and the animal scent the episode they go around shooting all the dogs and all that i gotta skip that part you're a big softie aren't you i i really am yeah i'm sure sure i'll probably cry at some point i love it i love it listen don't get me talking about that episode you made about your grandmother oh my god that was rough just to linger on this ethical versus legal question what do you think about people like aaron schwartz i don't know if you're familiar with him but he was somebody who broke the law in the name of an ethical ideal he downloaded and released academic publications that were behind a paywall and he was arrested for that and then committed suicide and a lot of people see him certainly in the mit community but throughout the world as a hero because you look at the way knowledge scientific knowledge is being put behind paywalls it does seem somehow unethical and he basically broke the law to do the ethical thing now you could challenge it maybe it is unethical but the you know there's a gray area and to me at least it is ethical to me at least he is a hero because i'm familiar with the paywall created by the institutions that hold these publications they're adding very little value so it is basically holding hostage the work of millions of brilliant scientists for for some kind of honestly a a crappy capitalist institution like they're not actually making that much money it doesn't make any sense to me it should to me it should all be open public access there's no reason it shouldn't be all publication should be so he stood for that ideal and and was punished harshly for it that's the other criticism it's too harshly and of course deeply unfortunately that also led to a suicide because he was also tormented on many levels i mean do you are are you familiar with him what do you think about that line between what is legal and what is ethical so it's tough it's a tough case i mean the the the outcome was tragic obviously unfortunately when you're in law enforcement you have to your job is to enforce the laws i mean it is not if if you're told that you have to do a certain case you know and then there is a violation of at the time you know eighteen usc ten ten thirty computer hacking you have to press forward with that i mean the the you have to charge you you bring the case to the you know secretary and staff office and whether they're gonna press charges or not you know you can't you can't really pick and choose what you press and don't press for it i i never felt that at least that flexibility not in the fbi i mean maybe if you when you're a street cop and you pull somebody over you can let them go with a warning so in the fbi you're sitting in a room but you're also you're also a human being you have compassion you arrested ross the hand on the chest i mean that's that's a human thing yeah so there's a but i'm i can't be the jury for whether it was a good hack or a bad hack it's all someone a victim has come forward and said we're the victim of this and and i agree with you because again i the basis of the internet was to share academic thought yeah i mean that's where the internet was born but it's not it's not up to you so the the role of the fbi is to enforce the law correct and you know there's a there's a limited number of tools on our on our batman belt that we can use you know not to get into all the aspects of the trump case and and mar a lago and the documents there i mean the the affiliate has so so many tools they can use and and a search warrant is the only way they could get in there i mean that's it it's a you know there's no other legal document or legal way to to enter and and get those documents what do you think about the the fbi and mar a lago and the fbi taking the documents for donald trump you know it's a tough spot i i it's a really tough spot the the fbi has gotten a lot of black eyes you know recently and and and i don't know if it's the same fbi that i i remember when i was there do you think they deserve it in part was it done clumsily the the the their rating of the former president's residence yeah it's tough it is you know because again they're only limited to what they're allowed what they're legally allowed to to do and and a search warrant is the only legal way of doing it i have my personal and political views on certain things you know and and i think it might yes it might be surprising to some where those political points stand but you you told me offline that you're a hardcore communist that was very strange very surprising to me well that's the only you tried to bring me into the communist party so exactly i was trying to recruit you just give me all kinds of flyers okay but you said like you know people in the fbi are just following the law but there is a chain of command and so on what do you think about the conspiracy theories that people some small number of people inside the fbi conspired to undermine the presidency of donald trump if you would ask me when i was inside and before all this happened i would say it could never happen i i don't believe in conspiracies you know there's too many people involved somebody's gonna come out with some sort of information but i mean from the more the stuff that comes out it's surprising that you know agents are being fired because of certain actions that are taken inside and being dismissed because of politically motivated actions so do you think it's explicit or just pressure just do you think there could exist just pressure at the higher ups that that has a political leaning and you kinda maybe don't explicitly order any kind of thing but you just kinda pressure people to lean one way or the other and and then create a culture that leans one way or the other based on political leanings you would really really hope not but it i mean that seems to be the narrative that's being written but when you were operating you didn't feel that pressure man i was so such a low level you know i i'd had no aspirations of being a boss i wanted to be a case agent my entire life so you love the puzzle of it and the the the chase i love solving things yeah yeah to be in management and manage people and all that like no desire whatsoever what do you think about mark zuckerberg on joe rogan's podcast saying that the fbi warned facebook about potential foreign interference and then facebook inferred from that that they're talking about hunter biden laptop story and thereby censored it what do you think about that whole story again you asked me when i was in the fbi i wouldn't believed it from being on the inside and i wouldn't believe these things but there's is a certain narrative being written that is surprising to me that the fbi is involved in these stories so but the interesting thing there is the fbi is saying that they didn't really make that implication they're saying that there's interference activity happening yeah just watch out and it's a weird relationship between fbi and facebook you could see from the best possible interpretation that the fbi just wants facebook to be aware because it is a powerful platform a platform for viral spread of misinformation so in the best possible interpretation of it it makes sense for api to send some information saying like we were seeing some shady activity absolutely but it seems like all of that somehow escalated to a political interpretation i mean yeah it sounded like there was a wink wink with it right the the i i don't know if mark meant for that to be that way you know i was like again are we being social engineered or or was that a true you know expression that that mark had and it i wonder if the wink wink is direct or it's just culture really you know maybe certain people responsible on the facebook side lean have a certain political lean and then certain people on the fbi side have a political lean when they're interacting together and it's like literally it has nothing to do with a giant conspiracy theory but just with a culture that has a particular political lean during a a particular time in history and so like maybe it could be hunter biden laptop one time and then it could be whoever donald trump junior's laptop another time it's a tough job i mean if you're the liaison if you're the fbi's liaison to to facebook you know there there are certain people that i'm sure they were offered a position at some point it seems we you know there's fbi agents that go to i know i know of a couple that's gone to facebook there's a there's a really good agent that now leads up their child exploitation stuff you know their squad mate runs their internal investigations both great investigators so you know there there's good money especially when you're an fbi agent that's capped out at a you know a thirteen ten or whatever pay scale you're capped out at it's it's alluring to to to be you know maybe want to please them and and and be asked to to join them yeah and over time that corrupts i think there has to be an introspection in tech companies about the culture that that they develop about the the political ideology the bubble it's interesting to see that bubble like i i've asked myself a lot of questions i've interviewed the pfizer ceo which seems now a long time ago and i've gotten a lot of criticism the positive comments but also criticism from that conversation and i did a lot of soul searching about the kind of bubbles we have in this world and it makes me wonder pharmaceutical companies they all believe they're doing good and i wonder because the the ideal they have is to create drugs that help people and do so at scale and it's hard to know at which point that can be corrupted it's hard to know when it was corrupted and if it was corrupted and where which which drugs and which companies and so on and i don't know i don't know that complicated it seems like inside a bubble you can convince yourself if anything is good people inside the the third reich regime were able to convince themselves i'm sure many just bloodlands is another book i've been re recently reading about it and the ability of humans to convince they're doing good when they're clearly murdering and torturing people in front of their eyes is fascinating they're able to convince themselves they're doing good it's crazy like there's not even a inkling of doubt yeah it i don't i don't know what to make of that so it's it's has taught me to be a little bit more careful when i enter into different bubbles to be skeptical about what's taken as an assumption of truth like you always have to be skeptical about like what's assumed is true is it possible it's not true you know if you're doing if you're talking about the america it's assumed that you know in certain places that surveillance is good well let's let's question that that's that assumption yeah and i also it inspired me to question my own assumptions that i i i hold this true constantly constantly it's tough it's tough but you don't grow i mean do you wanna be just static and not grow you have to question yourself on on some of these things if you wanna grow as a person yeah for sure one of the tough things actually actually of being a public personality when you speak publicly is you get attacked all along the way as you're growing right and and in part a big softy as well if i may say and those heart it hurts it hurts it hurts do you pay attention to it yeah yeah yeah yeah it's very hard like i have two choices one you can shut yourself off from the world and ignore it i've i never found that compelling this kind of idea of like haters gonna hate yeah like this idea that anyone with a big platform or anyone's ever done anything was always gotten hate you know okay maybe but like i still wanna be vulnerable wear my heart on my sleeve really show myself like open myself to the world really listen to people and that means every once in a while somebody will say something that touches me in a way that's like what if they're right do you let that hate influence you i mean can you be bullied into a different opinion than you think you really are no just because of that hate no no i believe not but it hurts yeah in a way that's hard to explain like yeah it just it it gets to like it shakes your faith in humanity actually is is is probably why it hurts like people that call me a putin apologist or zelensky apologist which i'm currently getting almost an equal amount of but it hurts it it hurts because i it hurts because it like it it damages slightly my faith in humanity to be able to see the love that connects us and then to see that i'm trying to find that and that's i'm doing my best in the in the limited capabilities i have to find that and so to call me something like a bad actor essentially from whatever perspective it just makes me realize well people don't have empathy and compassion for each other it it makes me question that for a brief moment and that that's like a crack and it it hurts how many people do this to your face very few yeah it's it's online emuscles man they're just flexing their muscles honest that it's it happens yeah because i've hung around with with rogan enough when your platform grows there's people that will come up to joe and say stuff to his face that they forget they they still they forget he's actual real human being yeah they'll they'll make accusations about him so does that cause him to wall himself off more no he's he's pretty gangster on that but yeah it still hurts if you're if you're human if you really feel others i think that's also the difference with with with joe and me he has a he has a family that he deeply loves and that's an escape from the world for him mhmm there's a loneliness in me that's i'm always longing to connect with people and with like regular people and like just to to to learn their stories and so on and so if you open yourself up that way the things they tell you can really hurt in every way like just me going to ukraine just seeing so much loss yeah and death some of it is like is i mean unforgettably haunting not in some kind of political way activist way or who's right who's wrong way but just like man like so much pain you see it and it just stays with you when you see a human being bad to another human you can't get rid of that in your head you can't imagine that you that that we can treat each other like that that's the hard part i think i mean it's it's that for me it is when when i saw parents like when i did the child exploitation stuff when they rented their children out they literally rented infant children out to others for sexual gratification like i don't know how a human being could do that to another human being and that that sounds like the kind of thing you're going through i mean i went through a huge funk when i did those cases afterwards i should have talked to somebody but in the fbi you you have to keep that machismo up or they're gonna take your gun away from you well i think that's examples of evil that that's like the worst of human nature but i like just because i have war is is just as bad i mean somehow war it's somehow understandable given all the the very intense propaganda that's happening so it's you can understand that there is love in the heart of the soldiers on each side given the information they're given there's a lot of people on the russian side believe they're saving these ukrainian cities from nazi occupation now there is stories there is a lot of evidence of people for fun murdering civilians now that that is closer to the things you've experienced uh-huh of like evil yeah of evil embodied and i haven't interacted with that directly with people who for fun murdered civilians but you know it's there in the world i mean you're not naive to it yes but if you experience that directly if somebody shot somebody for fun in front of me that would probably break me yeah like seeing it yourself knowing that it exists is different than seeing it yourself now i've interacted with the victims of that and they tell me stories and you see their homes destroyed destroyed for no good military reason it's civilians with civilian homes being destroyed that really lingers with you it's yeah the people that are capable of that that goes with the propaganda i mean if you were to build a story you have to you know you have to have on the other side you know the homes are gonna be destroyed the the non military targets are gonna be destroyed to put it in perspective i'm not sure a lot of people understand the deep human side or even the military strategy side of this war there's a lot of experts outside of the situation that are commenting on it with certainty mhmm and that kinda hurts me because i feel like there's a lot of uncertainty there's so much propaganda it's very difficult to know what is true yeah so so my whole hope was to travel to ukraine to travel to russia to talk to soldiers to talk to leaders to talk to real people that have lost homes that have lost family members that who this war has divided who this war changed completely how they see the world whether they have love or hate in their heart to understand their stories i've learned a lot on the human side of things by having talked to a lot of people there but it has been on the ukrainian side for me currently traveling to the russian side is more difficult let me ask you about your now friend can we go as far as the safest friend in asavu in hector what's the what's what's the story what's your long story with him can you tell me about what is lulzsec who is sabu and who's anonymous what is anonymous where's the right place to start that story probably anonymous anonymous is a was a d it still is i guess a decentralized organization they call themselves headless but once you look into them a little ways they're not really headless the the the power struggle comes with whoever's has a hacking ability that might be you're a good hacker or you have a a giant botnet used for ddos so so you're gonna wield more power if you can control where it goes anonymous started doing their like hacktivism stuff in two thousand ten or so the word hack was in the media all the time then and then right around then there was a federal contractor named hbgary federal the their ceo is aaron barr and aaron barr said he was gonna come out and deanonymize anonymous he's gonna come out and talk at blackhat or defcon or one of those and say you know who they are he figured it out or so he figured it out by based on you know when people were online when people were in irc when tweets came out it was there was no scientific proof behind it or anything so he was just gonna falsely name people that were that were in anonymous so anonymous went on the attack they went and hacked in h p b h p a federal and they turned his life upside down they took over his twitter account and all that stuff pretty quickly so i i have very mixed feelings about all of this okay i get like part of me admires the positive side of the hacktivism okay is there no room for admiration there of the fuck you to the man not at the time again it was a violation the eighteen usc ten thirty so it was my job it's what i you know so at the time no in retrospect sure okay yeah but what what was the philosophy of the hacktivism was it what what the philosophically were they at least expressing it for the good of humanity or no they outwardly said that they were gonna go after people that they thought were corrupt so they were judge and jury on corruption they were gonna go after it right once you get inside and realize what they were doing they were going after people that they had an opportunity to go after so maybe someone had a zero day and then they searched for servers running that zero day and then from there let's find a target i mean one time they went after a toilet paper company i still don't understand what that toilet paper company did but it was an opportunity to make a splash is there some some way for the joke for the lols it developed into that so i i think the hacktivism and the anonymous stuff wasn't so much for the lulz but from that hp gear federal hack then there were six guys that worked well together and they formed a crew a hacking crew and they kinda split off into their own private channels and that was lulzsec or or laughing at your security was their motto so that's l u l z s e c lulzsec of course it is lulzsec and who founded that organization so kayla and sabu were the hackers of the group and so they really did all the work on hpgary so they're these are code names yeah these are online names they're they're they're nicks and so you know they they and they that's all they knew each other as you know they talked as as those names and they worked well together and so they they formed a hacking crew and that's when they started the the at first they didn't name it this but it was the fifty days of lulz where they would just release major major breaches and it stirred up the media i mean it put hacking in on on in the media every day they had four hundred or five hundred thousand twitter followers you know and it was kind of interesting but then they started swinging at the beehive and they they they took out on some fbi affiliated sites and then they started fuck fbi fridays where every every friday they would release something and we waited it for bated breath i mean they had us our client and syncari pissed we were waiting to see what was gonna be dropped every friday it was it's a little embarrassing looking back on it now and this is in the early twenty tens yeah this was twenty ten twenty eleven around there so i actually linger on anonymous what do we still understand what the heck is anonymous just a place we hang out i mean it's just it started on four chan went to eight chan and then it's really just anyone you could be in anonymous right now if you wanted to just you're in there hanging out in the channel now you're probably not gonna get much cred until you work your way up and prove who you are or someone vouches for you but anybody can be an anonymous and you can leave anonymous what's the leadership of anonymous do you have a sense that there is a leadership there's a power play now there's not someone that you know that says this is what we're doing all we're we're doing i love the the philosophical and the technical aspect of all of this but i think there is a slippery slope to where for the laws you can actually really hurt people that's the that's the terrifying thing when you attach i'm actually really terrified of the power of the law yeah it's the fun thing somehow becomes a slippery slope i haven't quite understood the dynamics of that but even in myself if you just have fun with a thing you lose track of the ethical grounding of the thing and so like it feels like hacking for fun can just turn it like literally lead to nuclear war like literally destabilize yeah a yada yada yada nuclear war i could see it yeah so i'm i've been more careful with the law the i i've very yeah i've been more careful about that and i wonder about it because in in internet speak somehow ethics can be put aside through the slippery slope of language i don't know everything becomes a joke if everything's a joke then everything's allowed and everything's allowed then you don't have a sense of what is right and wrong you lose sense of what is right and wrong you still have victims i mean you're laughing at someone someone's the butt of this joke you know whether it's major corporations or the individuals i mean some of the stuff they did was just you know releasing people's pii and their personal identifying information and stuff like that i mean is it a big deal i don't know maybe maybe not but you know if you could choose to not have your information put out there probably wouldn't we do have a sense of what anonymous is today is has it ever been one stable organization or is it a collection of hackers that kind of emerge for particular tasks for per particular like hacktivism task and that kind of stuff it's a collection of people that has some hackers in it there's not a lot of big hackers in it i mean there are some that'll come bounce in and bounce out even back then there's probably just as many reporters in it people of the media in it ver with than than hackers at the time just trying to get the inside scoop on things you know some giving the inside scoop you know we were arrested a guy reported that he gave over the username and password to his newspaper and you know just so he could break the story he trusted him speaking of trust reporters boy there's good ones there is good ones there are there are but boy do i have a complicated relationship with them how many stories about you are completely true you can just make stuff up on the internet mhmm and one of the things that i mean there's so many fascinating psychological sociological elements of the internet to me one of them is that you can say that lex is a lizard right and if it's not funny so lizard is kind of funny what should we say lex has admitted to being an an agent of the fbi okay you could just say that right right and then the response that the internet will be like oh is that true i didn't realize that they won't go like provide evidence please right they'll just say like oh that's weird i didn't like i kinda thought he might be kinda weird and then it it piles on it's like hey hey hey guys like here's a random dude on the internet just said a random thing you can't just like pile up as and then yeah johnny sixty nine sixty nine is now a source that says and then like the thing is i'm i'm a i'm a tiny guy but when it grows if you're like have a big platform i feel like newspapers will pick that up and then they'll like start to build on a story and you never know where that story really started it's so cool i mean to me actually honestly it's kinda cool that there there's a viral nature of the internet that can just fabricate truth completely i think we have to accept that new reality and try to deal with it somehow you can't just like complain that johnny sixty nine can start a random thing but i i think in the best possible world it is the role of the journalist to be the adult in the room and put a stop to it versus look for the sexiest story so that they could be clickbait and they can generate money journalism should be about sort of slowing things down thinking deeply through what is true and not and showing that to the world i think there's a lot of hunger for that and i think that would actually get the most clicks in the end i mean it's that same pressure i think we're talking about with the fbi and with the the the tech companies about controllers i mean the editors have to please and get those clicks i mean they're measured by those clicks so you know the i'm sure the journalists the true journalists the good ones out there want that but they wanna stay employed too can i actually ask you really as another tangent the jared and others they're doing undercover yep in terms of the tools you have for catching cybersecurity criminals how much of it is undercover undercover is a high bar to jump over you have to do a lot to start an undercover in the fbi there's a lot of thresholds so it's not your first investigative tool step you have to identify a problem and then show that the lower steps can't get you there but i mean i think we we had an undercover going on in the squad about all times when one was being shut down or taken down we were spinning up another one so it's a good tool to have you know and utilize they're a lot of work i don't think if you run one you'll never run another one in your life oh so it's like psychologically is it there's a lot of work just technically but also psychologically like you have to really it's twenty four seven you're inside that world like you have to know what's going on and what's happening you you know you're taking on you have to remember who you are when you're because you're you're a criminal online you have to go to a special school for it too was that ever something compelling to you i went through the school but i'm a pretty open and honest guy and so it's tough for me to to build that wall of lies it's maybe i'm just not smart enough to keep all the lies straight yeah but a guy who's good at building up a wall of lies would say that exact same thing exactly it's so annoying the way truth works in this world it's like people have told me like because i'm trying to be honest and transparent that's exactly what an agent would do right but i feel like an agent would not wear a suit and tie i wear a suit and tie every day i was a suit and tie guy you wore yeah every day i remember one time i wore shorts in and the sac came in and this was when i i was i was a rock star at the time in the bureau and i i had shorts in and i said sorry ma'am i apologize for my attire and she goes you could wear bike shorts in here i wouldn't care i was like oh shit that sounds nice i never wore the bike shorts but yeah but see i don't i see a suit and tie as constraining i think it's it's liberating in sorts it's like shows that you're taking the moment seriously well not just that people wanted it i mean people expected when you knock you you are dressed like the a perfect fbi agent when someone knocks on their door that's what they wanna see they wanna see what hollywood built up is what an fbi agent is you show up like my friend he was dressed always in t shirts and shorts people aren't gonna take him serious they're not gonna give him what they want i wonder how many place they can just show up and like say i'm from the fbi and start interrogating them like at a bar probably like have a good definitely if they've had a few drinks you could definitely well but people are gonna recognize you that's the only problem that's another thing you start taking out big big cases you can't work cases anymore in the fbi true your face gets out there and your name too yeah yeah well actually let me ask you about that before we return to our friend sabu okay you've you've tracked and worked on some of the most dangerous people in this world have you ever feared for your life so i had to make a really really shitty phone call one time i was sitting in the bureau and this was right after silk road and jared called me he was back in chicago and he called me and said hey your your name and your kid's name are on a website for an assassination they're they're paying to have you guys killed now that these things happen on the black market they come up you know and and you know people debate whether they're real or not but we have to take it serious someone's paying to have me killed in my so i had to call my wife and we have a word and that if i said this word and we only said it one time to each other if i said this word this is serious drop what you're doing and get to the kids and so i had to drop the word to her and i could feel the breath come out of her because her she thought her kids were in danger and when they then at the time they were i wasn't in a state of mind to drive myself so an agent on the squad a girl named evelina she drove me lights and sirens all the way to make it school and we had locked i called the school we were in a lockdown nobody should get in or out especially someone with a gun the first thing they did was let me in the building with a gun so i was a little disappointed with that my kids were i think kindergarten and fifth grade or somewhere around there maybe they're closer second yeah i'm not sure where but all hell broke loose and we had to from there go move into a safe house i live in new york city nypd surrounded my house the fbi put cameras outside my house you couldn't drive in my neighborhood without like your license plate being red hey why is this person here why is that person there i got to watch my house on an ipad while i sat at my desk but you know again i put my family through that and it scared the shit out of them and that that's to be honest i think that's sort of my mother in law's words were i thought you did cybercrime and because during silk road i didn't tell my family what i was working on i mean you know i'll talk about this so why like i wanna escape that i don't wanna be there you know i remember that like so when i was in the fbi like driving in i used to go in at four thirty every morning because i get like to go to the gym before i hit go to the desk so i would be at the desk desk at seven so in the gym at five a couple hours and then then go the the best time i had was that drive in in the morning where i could just be myself i listened to a a sports podcast out of dc and i i i we've talked about sports and you know the nationals and whatever it was the capitals you know it was great to not think about silk road for ten minutes so but that was my best time but but yeah again so yeah i i i've had that moving to the safe house i left my m p five at home that's the the bureau's machine gun showed my wife to just pull pull and spray so but how how often did you live or work and live with fear in your heart it was only that time i mean in my for actual physical security then i mean after the anonymous stuff i you know i i really tightened down to my cybersecurity you know i don't have social media i don't have pictures of me and my kids online i don't really if i go to a wedding or something i say i don't take my picture with with my kids you know if you're gonna post it someplace or something like that so that sort of security i have but you know just like everybody you start to relax a little bit and security breaks down because it's not convenient but it's also part of your job so you're you're much better at like your job now and your job before so you're probably much better taking care of the low hanging fruit at least i understand the threat and i think that's what a lot of people don't understand is understanding what the threat against them is so so i'm aware of that and what what possibly and and i think about it you know i think about things i do remember so you you tripped a a memory in my my mind i remember a lot of times and i had a gun on my hip i i still carry a gun to this day opening my front door and being concerned what was on the other side leave walking out of the house yeah because i couldn't see it i remember when those four o'clock's heading to the car i i was literally scared yeah i mean having seen some of the things you've seen it makes you perhaps question how much evil there is out there in the world how many dangerous people there are there out there crazy people even there's a lot of crazy there's a lot of evil most people i think get into like cybercrime or just opportunistic not necessarily evil they don't really know maybe think about the victim they just do as it's a crime of opportunity you know i i i don't label that as evil and one of the things about america that i'm also very happy about is that rule of law despite everything we talk about there is it's tough to be a criminal in the united states so like if you walk outside of your house you're much safer you than you are in most other places in the world you're safer and and the system's tougher i mean lulzsec six guys one guy in the united states five guys other places hector was facing a hundred and twenty five years those guys got slaps on the wrist and went back to college you know different laws different places so who's hector tell me the story of hector so this law sect organization was started so hector was before that in he was he was in part in anonymous he was all he was doing all kinds of hacking stuff but then he launched lulzsec he's old school hacker i mean he he's he learned how to hack and i don't wanna tell his story but he he learned to hack because he grew up in the lower east side of new york and and picked up some nypd computers that were left on the on the sidewalk for trash yeah taught himself how to he doesn't exactly look like a hacker for people who don't know he he looks i don't know exactly what he looks like but not not not a not like a technical not what you would imagine but perhaps that's that's that's a hollywood portrayal yeah i think you get in trouble these days saying that that that what a hacker looks like i don't know if they have a traditional look just like i said hollywood has an idea what an fbi looks like yeah i don't think you can do that anymore i don't think you can say that anymore well he certainly has a big personality and charisma and all that kind of stuff that's taboo i i can i can i can see him selling me anything that's sabu that's convincing me of anything you know they're two different people there's sabu and there's hector hector hector is a sweet guy the the he he likes to have intellectual conversations and like that's just the thing he he he'd rather you know just sit there and have a one on one conversation with you but sabu that that's a ruthless motherfucker and you first met sabu i was tracking sabu it was tracking it was tracking knew was sabu i didn't know hector so when did your paths cross in terms of tracking when did you first take on the case the spring of eleven so it was through anonymous through anonymous well really kinda lulzsec we were lulzsec was a big thing and it was pushed out to all the the cyber you know fifty six field offices in the fbi most of them have cyber squads or cyber units and so you know it was being pushed out there and it was in the news every day but it really wasn't ours so that we didn't have a lot of victims in our in our aor area of responsibility and so we just kinda pay attention to it then i got a tip that a local hacker in new york had broken into aol and so olivia olivia olsen and i she's another agent who she's still in she's a supervisor out in la she's a great agent we went all around new york looking for this kid just to see what we can find and ended up out in staten island at his grandmother's house she didn't know where he was obviously why would she but i left my card he gave me a call that night and started talking to me and i said let's just meet up tomorrow at the mcdonald's across from twenty sixth fed and he came in and three of us sat there and talked and you know gave me a stuff he started telling me about the felonies he was committing those days including that break in aol and then he finally says you know you know i can give you sabu sabu to us was the kaiser society of hacken he was our guy you know he was the guy that was in the news that was pissing us off so so he was part part of the fbi fridays sabu was yeah oh he led it yeah he was the leader of fuck fbi fridays so yeah what was one of the more memorable f the triple f's i said what how how do you get why how and why do you go after the beehive that's kind of intense it gets you on the news it gets you it's the it's the the lulz it's it's funnier to go after the big ones boy you know and and they weren't getting like real fbi they weren't breaking into fbi mainframes or anything but they you know they were you know affiliate sites or anything that have to do a lot of law enforcement stuff was coming out so but you know we looked back and so if this kid knew that sabu we maybe there was a chance we could use him a little to to lure sabu out but we also said well maybe this kid knows sabu in real life and so we went and looked through the ips and ten million ips we find one and it belonged to him and so that that day sabu someone had doxxed sabu mhmm and we were a little afraid he was gonna be on the run we had a a surveillance team and fbi surveillance teams are awesome like you cannot even tell they're fbi agents it's it's an it's they are really that good i mean there's baby strollers and all whatever you wouldn't expect an fbi agent to have so that's a little like the movies a little bit yeah i mean it is true but and but they fit into the area so now they're on the lower east side which is you know you know baby stroller might not fit in there as well as you know somebody just laying on the ground or something like that they really get play the character and get into it so now i i can never trust a baby stroller again well probably shouldn't every every baby i'm just like look at stare at them suspiciously especially if the mom's wearing cargo pants while she pushes it so yeah so if it's like a verse stereotypical mom stereotypical baby i'm gonna be very suspicious i'm gonna question the baby that baby's wired we hear you you know we race out there and and like our squad's not even full there's only a few guys there and like i said i'm a i was a suit guy but that day i had shorts and a t shirt on i had a white t shirt on and i only bring it up because sabu makes fun of me to this day so i had a bulletproof vest and a white t shirt on and that was it alright shorts too and all that but raced over to there we didn't have any equipment we brought our boss's boss's boss he stopped off at nypd got us like a ballistic shield and a and a battering ram if we needed it and then we get to to hector's house sabu's house and he's on the sixth floor and so normally you know we're the the cyber dork squad we'll hop in the elevator six floors is a long ways to go up in bulletproof vest and a ballistic shield but but we had been caught in an elevator before on a search so we we we didn't yeah took the stairs we get to the top tad winded but knock on the door and this big towering guy opens the door just slightly and he sees the green vest with big yellow letters fbi and he steps outside can i help you you know and tries to social engineer us but eventually we get our way inside the house you know i noticed a few things that that are kind of out of place there's a laptop charger and a flashing modem and i said well do you have a computer here and he said no there's no computer here so we we knew the the the truce and then the half lies and all that sort of thing so it took us about another two hours and finally he gave up that that he was sabu he was the guy we were looking for and so we sat there and we kind of showed him sort of the evidence we had against him and you know from his words we sat there and talked talked like two grown adults and you know i gave him the options and he said well let's let's talk about working together so he chose to become an informant i don't think he chose that night but that's where it kinda went to so the the we brought him down to the fbi that night which was it was a funny trip because i'm sitting in the back seat of the car with him and i was getting calls from all over the us from different fbi agents saying that we arrested the wrong guy i was like i don't think so and they're like why do you think so i was like because he says it's him and they still said nope the wrong guy so i said well we'll see how it plays out it's so interesting because it's it's wet actually strange world such a strange world because it's it's tough to because you still have to prove it's the same guy right because because the anonymity yeah i mean we had his laptop by the you know by that point yeah i know but insane that helped i gave him a clue in my world yeah yeah but yeah if he would have fought it i mean that definitely would have come in as evidence that ever fbi agents are saying it's not him you have to disclose that stuff so he had a lot of stuff on him what was he facing if he was facing a hundred and twenty five years hundred and twenty five years in prison that's that no that's if you took every charge we had against him and put him you know consecutively no no one ever gets charged that but yeah he had essentially it would have been under twenty five years you know fast forward to the end he got thanked by the judge for his service after nine months and he walked out of the court a free man but that's being while being an informant yes well so the word informant here really isn't that good mhmm it does it's not fitting that that technically i guess that's what he was but he didn't know the other people it was all he knew nicks and all that he really gave us the insight of what was happening in the hacker world like i said he was an old school hacker he back when hackers didn't work together with anonymous you know he was down you know a cult of dead cow and those type of guys like way back and he was around for that he's like an encyclopedia of hacking but you know we just his prime was in the nineties for terror hack but yeah he kinda came back when when anonymous started going after mastercard and paypal and all that do the wikileaks stuff but even even that little interaction being an informant he probably made a lot of enemies does how how do you protect a guy like that he made enemies after we it was revealed yeah how does the fbi protect him yeah good luck i mean perhaps i'll talk to him one day but is that guy afraid for his life i i again i think it doesn't seem like it he has very good security for himself cybersecurity but you know yeah he doesn't like the negative things said about him online i don't think anybody does but you know i i think it's so many years of the internet kind of bitching at you and all that you get callisto it's just internet bitching and also the the hacking world moves on very quickly he he is kind of he's yeah like they're they're they're have their own wars to fight now and he's not part of those wars anymore there's still people out there that that that bitch and moan about him but but yeah i i think it's less i i think you know and he he he has a good message out there of you know trying to keep kids from making the same mistakes he made he he tries to really preach that how do people get into this line of work is there all kinds of ways being not not not your line of work his line of work it's just all the stories you've seen of people that are in anonymous and lulzsec and silk road and all the cyber criminals you've interacted with what's what's the profile of a cyber criminal i don't think there's a profile anymore you know i used to be able to say you know the kid in your mom's basement or something like that but it's not true anymore you know like it's it's it's wide it's like i've arrested i've arrested people that you wouldn't expect would be cyber criminals and it's in the united states it's international it's everything oh it's international i mean we're seeing a lot of the big hack hackers now the big arrest for hackers in england surprisingly you know there's you know you you're not gonna see there's a lot of good hackers like down in brazil but i don't think brazil law enforcement is as good to hunt them down so you're not gonna see the big arrests how much state sponsored cyberattacks are there do you think more than you can imagine and what wait but what do you wanna say at attack you had a successful attack or just a probing probing for information just like feeling you know testing that there's where the attack factors are trying to collect all the possible attack factors put a windows seven machine on the internet forward facing and put a put a packet sniffer on there and look at where the driver comes from i mean within twenty four hours you were gonna fill up a hard drive with packets just coming at it yeah i mean it's it's not hard to to know i mean it's just constantly probing for entry points into things you know you could you could go mad putting up honeypot draws in intrusions try to see what methodology see what's out there yeah and it doesn't go anywhere it maybe has fake information and stuff like that you know it's just kind of to to see what's going on and and judge what's happening in the internet gonna you know lick your finger and test the wind of what's happening these days the funny thing about like because i'm at mit that attracted even more attention for the not for the laws but for the technical challenge it seems like people enjoy hacking mit oh it's just the amount of traffic mit was getting for that in terms of just the sheer number of attacks from different places is crazy yeah like just like that putting up on machines seeing what comes nasa used to be the golden ring now everybody got nasa that was like the early nineties if you could hack nasa that was the now yeah mit is a big one yeah it's fun it's fun to see respect because i think in that case it comes from a a somewhat good place because you know they're not getting any money from mit it's more for the challenge let me ask you about that about this world of cybersecurity how big of a threat are cyberattacks for companies and for individuals like let's lay out where are we in this world what's out there it's the wild wild west and it's it's it's i mean people want the idea of security but it's inconvenient so they don't they push back on it and there are a lot of opportunistic nation state financially motivated hackers hackers for the lols you got three different tiers there and they're they're on the prowl they have tools they have really good tools that are being used against us and at what scale so when you're thinking of i don't know what's let's talk about companies first so say you're you're talking to a mid tier i wonder what the more most interesting business is so google let's let's we can look at large tech companies or we can look at medium sized tech companies and like you were sitting in a room with a cto with a ceo and the the question is how fucked are we and what should we do what's the low hanging fruit what's what what are the different strategies and those companies should consider i mean the problem is they want a push button they wanna they wanna out of the box solution that that i'm secure you know they wanna tell people they're secure but and that's very challenging to have it's impossible but like if i could if someone had it they'd be a billionaire you know they they they'd be beyond a billionaire you know because that that's what everybody wants so it's you know you can buy all the tools you want it's configuring them the proper way and there's if anyone's trying to tell you that there's one solution that fits all they're the stakeholder salesman and there's a lot of people in in cybersecurity that that are staying loyal salesman yeah and i feel like there's tools if they're not configured correctly they they just introduce they don't increase security significantly and they introduce a lot of pain for the people they decrease efficiency of the actual work you have to do so like we had i was at google for a time and i think mostly i wanna give props to their security efforts mhmm but user data so like data that belongs to users mhmm is like the holy like the the amount of security they have around that is incredible so most anytime i had to work with anything even resembling user data so i never got a chance to work with actual user data anything resembling that first of all you have no access to the internet it's impossible to even come close to the access to the internet and there's so much pain to actually like interact with that data where it i mean it's it was extremely inefficient in places where i thought it didn't have to be that inefficient the security was too much but i have to give respect to that because you in that case you wanna on the side of security but that's google yeah but they they were doing a good job of this the reputational harm if it got out i mean google you know why is google drive free you know because they want your data they want you to park your data there so you know if the if they got hacked or leaked information the reputational harm would be tremendous but you know for a company that's not it's really hard to do that right and the company is not as big as google or not as tech savvy as google might have a lot of trouble with doing that kind of stuff instead instead of increasing security they'll just decrease the efficiency well yeah so so there's a big difference between it and security and unfortunately like these midside companies they try to stack security into their it department your it department is about business continuity they're about trying to move business forward they want users to get the data they need to do their job so the company can grow security is not that they don't want you to get the data they you know but there's there's fine tuning you can do to you know ensure that i mean as simple as like having good onboarding procedures for employees like like you come into my company you don't need access to everything maybe you need access to some for one day turn the access on don't leave it on i mean i was the victim of the opm app the office of personnel management because old credentials from a third party vendor were sitting there inactive and the chinese government found those credentials and were able to log in and steal all my information so a lot could be helped if you just control the credentials the access the access control how long they last and people who have who need access to a certain thing only get access to that thing and not nothing else and then yeah and then it just gets refreshed like that access control yeah yeah like we said setting up people leaving people leaving the company get rid of their they don't need control two factor authentication you know that's a big thing you know we it's i i mean i i sound like a broken record because this isn't anything new this isn't rocket science the problem is we're not implementing it we're not if we are we're not doing it correctly because these guys are taking taking us well two factor authentication is a good example of something that i just was annoyed by for the longest time because yes it's very good but like it's it seems that it's pretty easy to implement horribly to where it's like it's not convenient at all for the for the legitimate user to use it should be trivial to to do like to authenticate yourself twice should be super easy if security if it's slightly inconvenient for you it's think about how inconvenient it is for a hacker and how this is gonna move on to the next person yes yes in theory when implemented extremely well yeah but i i just don't think so i think actually if if it's inconvenient it shows that system hasn't been thought through a lot was do do you know why we need two factor authentication people using the same password across the same site so when one site is compromised people just take that username and password it's called credential stuffing and just stuff it across the internet right so if ten years ago when we told everybody don't use the same fucking password across the internet across the vulnerable sites maybe two factor wouldn't be needed yeah so you wouldn't need two factor if everyone did good job with passwords yeah right but i'm saying like the two factor authentication it should it should be super easy to authenticate myself in some with some other device really quickly like there should be it should be frictionless like you just hit okay okay and anything that belongs to me yeah right and like i should it should very importantly be easy to set up what belongs to me i don't know the full complexity of the cyberattacks these platforms are under they're probably under insane amount of attacks yeah you've got it right there that people have no idea these large companies how often they're attacked you know on a per second basis and they have to fight all that off and and pick out the good traffic in there so yeah i i wouldn't i'd there's no way i'd wanna run a large tech company well what about protecting individuals for individuals what what's good advice for to try to protect yourself from this increasingly dangerous world of cyberattacks again educate yourself that you understand that there is a threat first you have to realize that then then then you're gonna step up and you're gonna do stuff a little bit more sometimes i guess think i take that to a little bit extreme i remember one time my mom called me and she was screaming that i woke up this morning and i just clicked on a link and now my phone is making weird noises and i was like throw your phone in a glass of water just put it in a glass of water right now and she's i i made my mom cry it was not a pleasant thing yeah so sometimes i go to a little extremes on those ones but but understanding there's a risk and making it a little bit more a little more difficult to to become a victim i mean just understanding certain things you know simple things like you know as we add more internet of the things to people's houses i mean how many wi fi networks do people have it's only just one and you're bumping your phones and giving your password to people to come to visit set up a guest network set up something you can change every thirty days simple little things like that you know i hate to remind you but change your passwords i mean i feel like i'm a broken record again but just make it more difficult for others to victimize you and then don't use the same password everywhere that that yes i mean i still i still know people that do that i mean ask dot f m dot got popped last week two weeks ago and that's three hundred and fifty million username and passwords with connected twitter accounts google accounts you know all the different social media accounts you know that is a treasure trove for the next two and a half three years of just using those credentials everywhere using you'll learn even if it is not the right password you learn people's passwords styles you know bad guys are making portfolios out of people you know we're figuring out how people generate their passwords and kind of you know figuring and then it's easier to crack their password you know we're making a dossier on each person it's three hundred fifty million dossiers just in that one hack yahoo there was a half a billion so the the thing a hacker would do with that is try to find all the lang low hanging fruit like have some kind of program that yeah evaluates the strength of the passwords and then finds the weak ones since that means that this person is probably the kind of person that would use the same password across multiple or even just write a program and do that remember the ring hack a couple a year ago that's all it was it was credential stuffing so ring the security system by default had two factor but didn't turn it on and they also had don't try unlimited tries to log in to my account you can lock it out after ten by default not turned on because it's not convenient for people you know ring you know is like i want people to stick these little things up and have security in their house but you know cybersecurity don't make it inconvenient then people won't not buy our product that's how they got hacked they they they would wanna say that it's insecure and got hacked into reputational harm right there for ring but they didn't it was just credential stuffing people bought username and passwords on on the black market and just wrote a bot that just went through ring and used every one of them to maybe one percent hit but that's a big hit to the number of ring users you know you can use also password managers to make to make the changing of the passwords easier yeah and secure and the to make you can change the difficulty the number of special characters the length of it and all that you know my my favorite things on websites yell at you for your password being too long or having too many special care or like or yeah you're not allowed to have this special character or something you can only use these three special characters it's a you know do you understand how password cracking works if you specifically tell me which pass what special characters i can use i wanna i i honestly just wanna have a one on one meeting like late at night with the engineer that programmed that because that's that's like an intern i just wanna have a sit down meeting yeah i i made my parents switch banks once because the security was so poor i was like you just you you can't have money here but then there's also like the zero day attacks like we mentioned i mentioned before the the qnep nas that got hacked luckily i didn't have anything private on there but it really woke me up until like okay so like if you take everything extremely seriously unfortunately for the end users there's nothing you can do about zero day it's you know there's this you have no control over that i mean it's a it's a the the engineers that made the software don't even know about it now let's talk about one days so there's a patch now out there for the security so if you're not updating your system for these security patches if it's just not on you my father-in-law has such an old iphone you can't security patch it anymore so you know and and i tell him i said you know this is what you're missing out on this is what you're exposing yourself to because you know that we talked about that powerful tool that the the how we found ross albrecht at gmail dot com well bad guys are using that too it's called you know it used to be called google dorking now it's i think it's named kinda google hacking by the community you can go in you know and find a vulnerability read about the white paper what's wrong with that that software and then you can go on the internet and find all of the computers that are running that outdated software and there's your list there's your target list yeah i know the vulnerabilities that are running again not making a playbook here but you know that's how easy it is to to find your targets and that's what that's what the the bad guys are doing then the reverse is tough it's much tougher but it's still doable which is like first find the target like if you have specific targets to to you know hack into a twitter account for example much harder that's probably social engineering right that's probably the best way probably if you if you wanted something specific to that i mean if you really wanna go far you know if you you're targeting a specific person you know how hard is it to get into their office and put a you know a little device usb device in line with their mouse who who checks how their mouse is plugged in and you for forty bucks on the black market you can buy a key logger that just usb then the mouse plugs right into it it looks like an extension on the mouse if you can even find it you can buy the the stuff with a mouse inside of it and just plug it into somebody's computer and there's a key logger that lives in there and calls home sends everything you want so i mean and it's cheap yeah in grad school a program that built a bunch of key loggers it was fascinating a tracking mouse just for what i was doing as part of the research i was doing to to see if by the dynamics of how you type and how you move the mouse you can tell who the person is oh wow that's like it's it's called the active authentication or like it's basically biometrics that's not using bio yeah to to see how identifiable that is so it's fascinating to study that but it's also fascinating how damn easy it is to install key loggers so i i think is is is in natural what happens is you realize how many vulnerabilities there are in this world you do that when you understand bacteria and viruses you realize they're everywhere and the same way with i'm talking about biological ones and then you realize that all the vulnerabilities that are out there one of the things i've noticed quite a lot is how many people don't log out of their computers just how easy physical access to systems actually is like in a lot of places in this world and i'm not talking about private homes i'm talking about companies especially large companies it seems quite trivial in certain places that i've been to to walk in and have physical access to a system and that's depressing to me it is it just i laugh because one of my my partners at at naxo that i work at now he he worked at a big company like you would know the name as soon as i told you i'm not gonna say it but the guy who owned the company and the company has his name on it didn't want to ever log into a computer it just annoyed the shit out of him so they hired a person that stands next to his computer when he's not there yeah and that's his physical security see that's good that's that's pretty good actually so yeah i mean i guess if you could afford to do that yeah at least you're taking your security seriously i feel like there's a lot of people in that case would just not have a login yeah no the the security team there had to really work around to make that work yeah noncompliant with company policy but that's that's interesting the the the key log there's there's there's a lot of there's just a lot of threats yeah i mean a lot of ways to get in yeah i mean so you can't sit around and worry about someone like physically gaining access to your computer with keylogger and stuff like that you know if you're traveling to a foreign country and you work for the fbi then yeah you do you pick little you know sometimes some countries you would bring a fake laptop just to see if they stole it or accessed it i really want especially in this modern day to just create a lot of clones of myself that generate lex sounding things and just get put so much information out there i actually dox myself all across the world and then you're not a target i guess just put it out there i've always said that though like we do these searches in fbi houses and stuff like that if someone just got like a box load of like ten terabyte drives and just encrypted them mhmm oh my god do you know how long the fbi would spin their wheels trying to get that data off there be insane oh so so just give them you don't even know which one you're looking for yeah that's true that's true so it's it's like me printing like a treasure map to a random location just get people to go on goose goose chases yeah what what about operating system what what have you found what's the most secure and what's the least secure operating system windows linux again is there no universal there's no universal security i mean it changed you people use anything macs for the most secure just because they just weren't out there but now kids have had access to them so you know it it you know i know you're a linux guy i i like linux too but you know it's tough to have run a business on on on linux you know people wanna move more towards the microsofts and the and the googles just because they they don't it's easier to communicate with other people that maybe aren't computer guys so you have to just take what what's best what's easiest and then secure the shit out of it as much as you can and just think about it what are you doing these days in nexo so we just started naxo it was so i left the government and went to a couple consultancies and i started working really all the people i i i i worked good in the government with i brought them out with me and now you you used to work for the man and now you're the man exactly so but now we formed a partnership and it's it's just a it's a new cybersecurity firm that we like our launch party is actually on thursday so it's gonna be exciting do do you do you wanna give more details about the party so that somebody can hack into it no i don't even tell you where it is you can come if you want but don't don't don't bring the hackers so well that's hector will be there with us i can't believe you invited me because the you also say insider threat is is the is the biggest threat by the way can you explain what the insider threat is the biggest insider threat in my life is my children my my son's big into minecraft and will download executables mindlessly and just run them on the network so he's did you recommend against marriage and family and kids nope nope i see from a security perspective from a security perspective absolutely but no i just segmentation i mean we do it in all businesses for years started segmenting networks different networks i just do it at home my kid's on his own network it makes it a little bit easier to see what they're doing too you can monitor traffic and then also throttle bandwidth if if you know your netflix isn't playing fast enough or it buffers or something so you can obviously change that a little too you know you know they're gonna listen to this right they're gonna get your tricks yeah that's true they'll definitely will listen but there's nothing more humbling than your family you think you've done something big and you go on a big podcast and talk to les freeman and they they don't they don't fucking care no no no no no unless unless you're on tiktok or yeah oh you you you'll show up on a youtube feed or something like that and i'll be like oh yeah this guy's boring yeah my my son does a a podcast for his school and it's still i still can't get him to tell like so so one of the hector and i just started a podcast talking about cybersecurity security we we do a podcast called hack hacker and the fed it just came out yesterday so first episode episode nice so yeah we got thirteen thirteen that thirteen hundred downloads the first day so pretty we were at the top of hacker news which is a big website in our our world so it's called hacker and the fed hacker and the fed's name is so go download and listen to hacker and the fed i i can't wait to see what because i don't think i've seen a video of you two together so i can't wait to see what the the chemistry is like we're i mean it's weird that you guys used to be enemies and now you're friends so yeah i mean we just did some a trailer and all that and the the our producer we have a great producer guy named phineas and he he kinda pulls things out of me and i've said i said okay i got one my relationship with hector is you know we're we're very close friends now and and i was like oh i arrested one of my closest friends yeah which is a very strange relationship yeah it's weird you know but but he he says that i changed his life i mean he was going down a very dark path and i gave him an option that one night and he he made the right choice i mean he's he now does penetration testing he does a lot of good work and you know he's turned his life around do you worry about cyber war in the twenty first century absolutely yeah if there is a global war it'll start with cyber you know if it's not already started do you do you feel like there's a like a boiling like the the drums of war are beating what's happening in ukraine with russia it feels like the united states becoming more and more involved in the conflict in that part of the world and china is watching very closely be is starting to get involved geopolitically and probably in terms of cyber do you worry about this kind of thing happening in the next decade or two like where it really escalates you know people in the in the nineteen twenties were completely terrible at predicting the world war two do you think we're at the precipice of war potentially i think we could be i i mean i i i would hate to just be you know just fear mongering out there you know covid's over so the next big thing in the media is war and all that but i mean there there's some some flags going up that are that are very strange to me is there a way to avoid this i hope so i hope smarter people than i are figuring it out i hope people are playing their parts in in in talking to the right people because that's the war is the last thing i want well there's two things to be concerned about on the cyber side one is the actual defense on the technical side of cyber and the other one is the panic that what might happen when something like some dramatic event happened because of cyber some major hack that becomes public i'm honestly more concerned about the panic because i feel like if people don't think about this stuff the panic can hit harder like if if they if if they're not conscious about the fact that we're constantly under attack i feel like it'll come like a much harder surprise yeah i think people will be really shocked on things i mean so we talked about lulzsec today and lulzsec was two thousand eleven they had access into a water the water supply system of a major us city they didn't do anything with it they were sitting on it in case someone got arrested and they were gonna maybe just expose that it's that it's insecure maybe they were gonna do something to fuck with it i don't know but you know that that's that's two thousand eleven you know i don't think it's gotten a lot better since then and there's probably nation states or major organizations that are sitting secretly on hacks like this a hundred percent a hundred percent they are sitting serially waiting to expose things i mean i i again i don't wanna scare the shit out of people but people have to understand the cyber threat i mean there are you know there are there there are thousands of nation state hackers in some countries i mean we have them too we have offensive hackers you know the the terrorist attacks of nine eleven there's planes that actually hit actual buildings and it was visibly clear and you can trace the information with cyberattacks say something that would result in the ex in a major explosion in new york city how the hell do you trace that like if it's well done it's going to be extremely difficult the the problem is it it there's so many problems one of which the us government in that case has complete freedom to blame anybody they want true and then to to go start war with anybody anybody that actually see jew alright that's sorry that's one cynical take on it of course no but you're going down the right path i mean the guys at the flu planes in the building just wanted attribution they took credit for it when we see the cyberattack i doubt we're gonna see attribution maybe the victim side the us government on this side might come out and try to blame somebody but you know like you've brought up they they could blame anybody they want there's not really a good way of verifying that can i just ask for your advice so in in my personal case am i being tracked how do i know how do i protect myself should i care you are being tracked i wouldn't say you're being tracked by the government you're you're definitely being tracked by big tech they no i mean me personally lex an an escalated level so like like you mentioned there's an fbi file on people sure i'd love to see what's in that file who did i have the argument oh let me ask you fbi yeah how's the cafeteria food in fbi at the academy it's bad yeah what about like at headquarters headquarters little bit better because that's where the director i mean he he eats up on the seventh floor i mean he's got at google have you been at the silicon valley those cafeteria like those i've been to the google in silicon valley i've been to the google in in new york yeah the food is incredible it is great so fbi is worse well when you're going through the academy they don't let you outside of the building so you have to eat it and i think that's the only reason people eat it yeah it's it's it's pretty bad i got it okay i don't go away but there's also a bar inside the fbi academy people don't know that alcohol bar yes alcohol bar wow and if you as long as you've passed your pt and and and going well you're allowed to go to the bar nice it it feels like if i was a hacker i'll be going after like celebrities because they're a little bit easier like celebrity celebrities like hollywood hollywood nudes were a big thing there for a long time but not even yeah i guess nudes is what they went after i mean then all those guys they socialized they did they they social engineered apple to get backups to get the recoveries for backups and then they just pulled all their news and i mean whole websites were dedicated to that yeah see that see i wouldn't do that kind of stuff it's very creepy i i would go if i was a hacker i would go after like major like powerful people and like tweet something from their account and like something that like positive like loving but like for the for the walls the obvious that it's a troll god you get busted so quick by a bad hacker really but what because hackers never put things out about love okay oh you mean like this is clearly yeah this is clearly lex what the fuck about love and every podcast he does i i would just be like no oh goddamn it now somebody's gonna do it and you'll blame me it wasn't me looking back at your life is there something you i'm only forty four years old i'm already looking back is there stuff that you regret ev unit yes it got away that was the one that got away yeah i mean it took me a while into my law enforcement career to learn about like the compassionate side and and it took hector monsager to make me realize that criminals aren't really criminals they're human beings that really humanized the whole thing for me sitting with him for for nine months i think that's maybe why i had a lot more compassion when i arrested ross probably wouldn't have been so compassionate if it was before hector but but yeah he changed my life and showed me that that that humanity side of things so would it be fair to say that all the all the criminals or most criminals are just people that took a wrong turn at some point they they all have the capacity for for good and for evil in them i'd say ninety nine percent of the pea the criminals that i've interacted with yes the the people with the child exploitation no i don't have any place in my heart for them what advice would you give to to people in college people in high school trying to figure out what they wanna do with their life how to have a life they can be proud of how to have a career they can be proud of all that kind of stuff in the us budget that was just put forward there's eighteen billion dollars for cybersecurity we're about a million people short of where we really should be in the industry if not more if you have want job security and want to work and and see exciting stuff head towards cybersecurity it's a it's it's a good career and you know one thing i dislike about like cybersecurity right now is they expect you to come out of college and have ten years experience in protecting and knowing every different python script out there and and everything available you know the industry needs to change and let the lower people in in order to to to broaden and and get the those billion jobs filled but as far as their personal security just remember it's all gonna follow you i mean you know there's laws out there now that you have to turn over your social media accounts in order to have certain things they just changed that in new york state if you wanna carry a gun you have to turn over your social media to to figure if you're a good social character so hopefully you didn't say something strange in the last few years and it's gonna follow you forever i i bet ross alberich would tell you the same thing when not don't put ross alberk at g mail dot com on things because it's gonna last forever yeah people sometimes for some for some reason they interact on social media as if they're talking to a couple of buddies like just shooting shit and and mocking and and like you know what is that busting each other's chops like making fun of yourself like being especially gaming culture like people who stream thank god that's not recorded oh my god the things people say on those streams yeah but a lot of them are recorded yeah this is so there's there's a whole twitch thing where people stream for many hours a day and i mean just outside of the very offensive things they say they just swear a lot they're not the kind of person that i would wanna hire yeah i wanna wanna work with now i understand that some of us might be that way privately i guess when you're shooting shit with friends like playing a video game and talking shit to each other maybe yeah but like that's all out there you have to be conscious of the fact that that's all out there and it it's just not it's not a good look it's not like you're you should it's it's complicated because i'm like against hiding who you are but like an asshole you should hide some of it yeah but like i just feel like it's going to be misinterpreted when you talk shit to your friends while you're playing video games it it doesn't mean you're an asshole because you're an asshole to your friend but that's how a lot of friends show love yeah an outside person can't judge how i'm friends with you right if i wanna be this is our relationship if that person can say that that i'm an asshole to them then that's fine i'll take it but you can't tell me i'm an asshole to them just because you saw my interaction i agree with that they'll take those words out of context and now that's that's considered who you are is is dangerous and people take that very nonchalantly people treat their behavior on the internet very very carelessly that's definitely something that you need to learn and take extremely seriously also i think like taking that seriously will help you figure out who you what you really stand for if you use your language carelessly you'd never really ask like what do i stand for i feel like it's a good opportunity when you're young to ask like what are the things that are okay to say what are the things what are the ideas i stand behind like what are especially if they're controversial and i'm willing to say them because i believe in them versus just saying random shit for the for the laws because for the random shit for the laws keep that for off the internet that said man i was an idiot for most of my life and and i'm constantly learning and growing i'd hate to be responsible for the kind of person i was in my teens oh in my in my twenties i didn't do anything offensive but it just i i changed as a person like i used to i guess i probably still do but i used to you know i used to read so much existential literature that that was a phase there's like phases yeah you grow and evolve as a person that changes you in the future yeah i thank god there wasn't social media when i was in high school thank god oh my god i would never be out in the fbi would you recommend that people consider a career at at a place like the fbi i loved the fbi i never thought i would go any place else but the fbi i i thought i was gonna retire with the the the gold watch and everything from the fbi that was my final gold watch no but you know what it is it's a oh it's an explosion alright you you get a gold badge you actually get your badge in lucite and your creds they put in lucite and all that so does it does it by the way just on a tangent since we like those does it hurt you that the fbi by certain people is distrusted or even hated hundred percent it kills me i like i've never until recently not i sometimes be embarrassed about the fbi sometimes which is really really hard for me to say because i love that place i love the people in it i love the the the brotherhood that you have with you know all the guys in your squad you know guys and girls i just use guys you know you know we we i i developed a real drinking problem there because we were so social of going out after after work and and and you know continuing on it really was a family you know so i i do miss that but yeah i mean if somebody can become an fbi agent i mean it's pretty fucking cool man the day you graduate and walk out of the academy with a gun and a badge and you know the the power to charge someone with a misdemeanor for flying a united states flag at night that's awesome so so there is a part of like representing and loving your country and especially if you're doing cybersecurity security so there's a lot of technical savvy in the in different place in the fbi yeah i mean there there's different pieces sometimes you know you'll see an an older agent that's done you know not cybercrime come over to cybercrime at the end so he can get a job once he goes out mhmm but there's also some some guys that come in you know i i won't name his name but there was a guy i mean i think he was a hacker when he was a kid and now he's been an agent now he's way up in management great guy i love this guy and he knows who he is if he's listening you know that that you know he had some skills but we also lost a bunch of guys that had some skills because we had one guy in the squad that he had to leave the fbi because his wife became a doctor and she got a residency down in houston and and she couldn't move he he wasn't allowed to transfer so he decided to keep his family versus the fbi so there's some stringent rules in the fbi that that that need to be relaxed a little bit yeah i love hackers turned like leaders like one of my quickly becoming good friends is mudge there's a it was a big hack in the nineties and then now it was recently twitter chief security officer cso but he had a bunch of different leadership positions including being my boss at google but but originally a hacker it's cool to see like hackers become like leaders i just wonder what's what would cause him to stop doing it why why he would then take like a like a managerial route for high-tech companies first a lot of those guys so this is like the nineties they really were about like the freedom there's like a philosophy to it yeah and when i think the hacking culture evolved over the years and i think when it leaves you behind you start to realize like oh actually what i wanna do is i wanna help the world and i could do that in legitimate routes and so on but that's the story that and yeah i would i would love to talk to him one day but i i wonder how common that is too like young hackers turn turn good you're saying it like pulls you in it's if you're not careful it can really pull you in yeah it's it's you you know you're good at it you become powerful you become you know everyone's slapping you on the back and say what a good job and all that you know at a very young age yeah so yeah i would love to get into my buddy's mind on why he stopped hacking and moved on that's gonna be a good conversation in in in his case may maybe it's always about a great woman involved a family and so on yeah that grounds you because like we have there is a danger to hacking they that once you're in a relationship once you have family maybe you're not willing to partake in what's your story what from childhood what are some fond memories you have fond memories where did you grow up well well i don't give away that information in the isas for you yeah yeah yeah in virginia in virginia yeah what are some rough moments what are some beautiful moments that you remember i i had a very good family growing up the the like rough moment and i'll tell you a story that just happened to me two days ago and it fucked me up man it really didn't you'll be the first i've never told that i i tried to tell my wife this two nights ago and i couldn't get it out so my father he's a disabled veteran or he was a disabled veteran he was in the army and got hurt and was in a wheelchair his whole life for all my growing up he he was my biggest fan he just wanted to know everything about you know what's going on in the fbi my stories i was a local cop before the fbi and i got to a high speed car chase you know foot chase and all that and kicking doors in he he he wanted to hear none of those stories and at some points i was kinda too cool for school and dad i just want a break and all that and and things going on i we we lost my dad during covid not because of covid but it was around that time but but it was right when covid was kicking off and so he died in a hospital by himself and i didn't get to see him then and then my mom had some people visiting her the other night and tom and karen rogenberg and i'll say they're my second biggest fans right behind my dad they they they always asking about me and and my career and read the books and seen the movie they'll they'll even tell you that silk road movie was good they'll lie to you on that but and so they came over and and i i helped them with something and my mom was called me back couple days later and she said i appreciate you helping them i you know i know you know fixing someone's apple phone over the phone really isn't what you do for a living it's not it's kinda beneath you and all that and but but i appreciate it and she said oh they they loved hearing the stories about you know silk road and all those things and she goes you know your your dad he he loved those stories he just he i i just wish he coulda heard them like he even would tell me he would say you know maybe maybe chris will come home and i'll i'll get him drunk and and he'll tell me the stories but and then she goes maybe one day in in heaven you can tell him those stories and i fucking lost it i literally stood in my shower sobbing yeah like like a a child like it it just thinking about like all my dad wanted was those those stories yeah and now i'm on a fucking podcast telling stories to the world and yeah he's out here tell him yeah so did you ever have like a long heart to heart with him about like about such stories he was in the hospital one time and i went through and i wanna know about his history like his life what he did yeah and i think he maybe sensationalized some of it yeah but that's what you want your dad's a hero so you wanna hear those things he's a good storyteller yeah again i don't know what was true or not true but you know some of it was really good and it was just good to hear his life but you know we lost him and and and now those stories are gone you miss him yeah what did he teach you about what it means to be a man so my dad he was an engineer and so part of his job we worked for vermont power and electric or whatever it was i mean he when he first got married to my mom and all that like he flew around in helicopter checking out like power lines and dams he would he used to swim inside the scuba into dams to check to make sure like they were functioning properly and all that nice pretty cool shit yeah and then he couldn't walk anymore i probably would've killed myself if my life switched like that so bad and my dad probably went through some dark points but he hid that from me maybe and so to to get through that struggle to to teach me like you know you you press on you have a family people count on you you do what you gotta do that was that was big yeah oh i'm sure you make them proud man i i i i'm sure i do but i don't think he knew that that i knew that well you get to pass on that love to your kids now i try i try but i i can't impress them as much as my dad impressed me i can try all i want but well what do you think is the role of love because you you you you gave me some grief you busted my balls a little bit for talking about love a lot what do you think is the role of love in the human condition i think it's the greatest thing i think everyone should be searching for it if you don't have it find it get it as soon as you can i love my wife i really do i had no idea what what love was until my kids were born my son came out and this is a funny story he came out and you know i just wanted him to be safe and be healthy and all that and i said to the doctor i said ten and ten doc you know ten fingers ten toes everything good and he goes nine and nine i was like what the fuck i was like oh this is gonna suck okay we'll deal with it and all that he was talking about the apnegard cord or some score about breathing and color and all that and i i was like oh shit but i i no one told me this yeah but so i'm just sobbing i couldn't even cut the umbilical cord like just fell in love with my kids when i saw them and and that to me really is what what love is like just for them man and and i see that through your career that love developed which is awesome the the the the the being able to see the humanity in people i didn't when i was young the the the foolishness of youth yeah you know i i needed to learn that lesson hard i mean you know when i was young in my career it was just about career goals and you know and resting people became stats you know you arrest someone you get a good stat you get an attaboy you know maybe you know the boss likes it and you get a better job or you get you move up the chain it took it took a real change in my life to to see that humanity and i can't wait to to listen to to you talk which is probably hilarious and insightful given the life you the two you lived and given how much you've changed each other's lives i can't wait to listen brother thank you so much this is a huge honor you're amazing person with an amazing life this is an awesome conversation dude huge fan i love the podcast glad i could be here thanks for the invite it's an honor so and the exercise in the brain too it was great it was a great conversation and the hard too right oh yeah yeah you got you got some tears there at the end thanks for listening to this conversation with chris tarbell to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from benjamin franklin they who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
