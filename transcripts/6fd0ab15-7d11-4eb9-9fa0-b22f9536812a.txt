the following is a conversation with andrew huberman his fifth time on the podcast he is the host of the huberman lab podcast and is an amazing scientist teacher human being and someone i'm grateful to be able to call a close friend also he has a book coming out next year that you should preorder now called protocols an operating manual for the human body and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this podcast we got a sleep for naps element for electrolytes a g one for nutrition shopify for ecommerce netsuite for business management software and betterhelp for mental health choose wise my friends also if you want to work with our amazing team or just wanna get in touch with me go to alex freeman dot com slash contact and now onto the full ad reads as always no ads in the middle i try to make these interesting but if you must skip them please still check out our sponsors i enjoy their stuff maybe you will too this episode is brought to you by asleep and it's pod four ultra first of all pod four is an improvement over the pod three which was already awesome two x the cooling power i always love it when stuff is just improving when smartphones are improving llms are improving like jump to claw three five it's just great and then gpt five might be coming out soon it's just great it's great to see improvement but also there's the ultra part which is an extra layer that adds the base that goes between the mattress and the bed frame and the base can control the physical position of the actual mattress so basically you can sleep in your bed and you can also read in your bed which is a thing that i think a lot of people like doing i i have trouble reading too much of my bed because i fall asleep i think the bed is just too nice anyway go to eight sleep dot com slash lex and use code lex to get three hundred and fifty bucks off the pod for ultra this episode is also brought to you by lmnt the drink that andrew and i consume a lot of during the episode i drink a lot of lmnt almost not almost on every single podcast episode that's just what i drink i put element in the water i take i have one next to me right now a pod rated zero bottle with twenty eight fluid ounces fill it up with water put one packet of alum in there usually watermelon salt mix it all up put in the fridge and about thirty minutes later there's cold refreshing deliciousness but yeah in the texas heat when i'm doing the long runs or hard training sessions like i just did ten rounds the other day in grappling no drinks i usually don't like to drink during training so afterwards you're just your body is completely dehydrated and that's such an amazing feeling to replenish it with all the electrolytes you need so and especially when it's cold and delicious i love it get a sample pack for free with any purchase try it at drink element dot com slash lex this episode is also brought to you by ag one an all in one daily drink to support better health and peak performance it's kind of hilarious how when andrew and i hang out how the supplementation and the diet and just our way of being is on point there's a lot of a g one consumed there's a lot of almond consumed and there's a lot of ground beef or steak consumed on a regular basis we've been planning to run together more but we haven't quite done that it's mostly my fault because running has just been such a solo thing for me i really don't remember the last time i ever run with anybody i get so much into my head that i just feel like i'm even more introverted than i usually am like i lose myself inside my mind it's become such a meditative process that to do running with another person it just feels a little bit weird i feel like i wouldn't be able to sort of contribute to the conversation if there's a conversation and also like pacing wise there's a certain pace where conversation is still possible but it's a little uncomfortable so and i can't really think at that pace that well and talk i already struggle talking so i don't know we'll have to figure it out but he's just such a great person to work out with and a great person to talk to that we'll have to figure it out anyway ag one is always part of the picture and i drink it twice a day it's the foundation of my nutrition it's the thing when i consume it i feel like i've got all my bases covered no matter the crazy mental or the physical stuff that i'm going to do they'll give you a one month supply of fish oil when you sign up at drink a g one dot com slash lex this episode is also brought to you by shopify a platform designed for anyone to sell stuff anywhere with a great looking online store it took me a really short time to set everything up lex freeman dot com slash store there's a few shirts on there i actually got a lynyrd skynyrd shirt via shopify recently and i love it i need to get more rock music like classic rock shirts they brought so much joy to me that i just wanna celebrate it i don't know why but that seems like a cool way to celebrate it especially if it's a like a nice lynyrd skynyrd or a led zeppelin or pink floyd shirt you know a shirt i haven't quite found that's the golden i'm sure won't exist is srv steven ray vaughan i just don't want a generic one i want a super cool one him and jimi hendrix have a certain way

the company is the meta machine and society is the meta meta machine because it's a collection of groups and companies it's also a collection of nations in a constant state of anarchy against each other with no centralized control the centralized control comes from the government that does the regulation on the on the machine of capitalism but within capitalism there's a certain degree of freedom that allows you to build epic shit to build epic stuff and that's where netsuite could be the thing that helps you build the epic stuff by taking care of all the messy things like financials hr inventory supply ecommerce if that's the thing you do and much more business related stuff over thirty seven thousand companies have upgraded to netsuite by oracle i wonder how many companies there are in the world it's kinda cool to think that there's thirty seven thousand companies each one with a person who founded or a collection of people founded that had a dream and that are working hard to bring that dream into a reality trying to survive trying to thrive trying to make money trying to put food on the table of all the families involved all the responsibility of that i don't know those are all little puzzles little battles sometimes big battles fought it's cool i love humans this is one of the ways that humans are awesome take advantage of netsuite's flexible financing plan at net suite dot com slash lex that's net suite dot com slash lex this episode is brought to you by betterhelp spelled h e l p help they figure out what you need and match you with a licensed therapist in under forty eight hours it's kind of incredible the power of language the power of spoken language to explore the human mind because in order to generate speech if you take an idea that's in your head as you compress that idea into something that could be represented in comprehensible sequence of words and you have to speak it within the full context of everything that's been spoken previously and everything that's been going on around and then there's another human being on the other side that hears it first of all they have to hear it correctly you know if it's noisy or whatever or maybe their whole mind is focused on some aspect of the scene that prevents them from being able to really hear what's being said but once they do they have to then interpret it and decode decompress the thing that was represented in language into an idea and visualize it integrate it load it in to the brain and make sense of that idea again in the full context of everything that's happened before and in that way back and forth humans talk and make sense of the world together and make sense of their own mind together it's just cool it's cool that that's even possible and it's cool that that's actually a powerful way to understand yourself and to understand the world so yeah i'm a big fan of talking of rigorous deep conversation and certainly talk therapy is rigorous and deep when done well

help dot com slash lex this is a lex freeman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's andrew huberman you think there's ever gonna be a day when you walk away from podcasting definitely i mean i came up within and then on the periphery of skateboard culture and for the record i was not a great skateboarder i always have to say that because skateboarders are relentless if you call something you didn't do or whatever i mean i could do a few things and i loved the community and i still have a lot of friends in that community jim febo at deluxe you can look him up he's kind of the man behind the whole scene i know tony hawk danny way all these guys i got to see them come up and get big and stay big in many cases start huge companies like danny and colin mccace or dc some people have a long life in something some don't but one thing i observed and learned a lot from in skateboarding at the level of observing the skateboarders and then the ones that started companies and then what i also observed in science and still observe is you do it for a while you do it at the highest possible level for you and then at some point you pivot and you start supporting the young talent coming in in fact the greatest scientists people like richard axel catherine dulac there are many other labs in neuroscience karl deisseroth they're not just known for doing great science they're known for mentoring some of the best scientists that then go on to start their own labs and i think in podcasting i'm very fortunate i got in in a fairly early wave not the earliest wave but thanks to your suggestion of doing a podcast fairly early wave and i'll continue to go as long as it feels right and i feel like i'm doing good in the world and providing good but i'm already starting to scout talent my company that i started with rob moore sicom media there's a couple other guys in there too mike blabach our photographer ian mackey chris ray martin phobes we are a company that produces podcasts right now that's huberman lab podcast but we're launching a new podcast perform with doctor andy galpin nice and we wanna do more of that kind of thing finding a really great talent highly qualified people credentialed people and i've got a new kind of obsession with scouring the internet looking for the young talent in science in health and related fields and so will there be a final episode of the hlp yeah i mean bullet buster cancer aside you know someday i'll they'll be the very last and thank you for your interest in science and i'll click out yeah i love the idea of walking away and not be dramatic about it right when it feels right you can leave and you can come back whenever the fuck you want right jon stewart did this well with the daily show i i think that was during the twenty sixteen election when everybody wanted him to stay on and he just walked away dave chappelle for different reasons walked away disappeared came back gave away so much money didn't care and then came back and was doing like stand up in the park in the middle of nowhere genius you have khabib who undefeated walks away at the very top of of a sport is he coming back no at least we don't know yeah right you don't know i don't know if you know bears everywhere are words yeah i think you know it's it's always a call you know you know the last few years have been tremendous growth we launched in january twenty twenty one and even this last year twenty twenty four has been huge growth you know in all sorts of ways it's been wild and we have some short form content planned thirty minute shorter episodes that really distill down the critical elements we're also thinking about moving to other venues besides podcasting so there's always the thought and the discussion but when it comes to like when to hang up your cleats you know it's like there just comes a natural time where you can do more to mentor the next generation coming in than focusing on self and so there will come a time for that and i think it's critical i mean again i saw this in skateboarding like danny and colin and danny's brother damon started dc with ken block the driver who unfortunately passed away a little while ago rally car driver and they eventually sold it i think to quicksilver or something like that but they're all phenomenal talents in their respective areas but they brought in the next you know the next line of amazing riders for the plan b thing you know paul rodriguez for skateboarders they know who this is now in in science there are scientists like feynman for instance i don't know if anyone can name one of his mentor offspring so there are scientists who are phenomenal like beyond world class right multigenerational world class who don't make good mentors i'm not saying he wasn't a good mentor but that's not what he's known for and then there are scientists who are known for being excellent scientists and and great mentors and i think there's no higher celebration to be had at the end of one's career if you can look back and be like hey i put some really important knowledge into the world people made use of that knowledge and guess what you spawned all these other scientific offspring or sport offspring or podcast offspring i mean in some ways we look to rogan and to some of the other earlier podcasts is like they you know they paved the way rhonda patrick first science podcast out there so you know it eventually the baton passes but fortunately right now everybody's active and it and it feels really good yeah well you're talking about the healthy way to do it but there's also a different kind of way where you have somebody like grisha gregori perlman the mathematician who refused to accept the fields medal so he's one of the greatest living mathematicians and he just walked away from mathematics and rejected the fields medal what did he do after he left mathematics life private one hundred percent no i respect that he's become essentially a recluse is these photos of him looking very broke mhmm like he could use the money he he turned away the money he turned away everything you know there's there there's you just have to listen to the inner voice you have to listen to yourself and make the decisions that don't make any sense for the rest of the world and make sense to you i mean bob dylan didn't show up to pick up his nobel peace prize that's punk yeah yeah he probably grew in notoriety for that you know maybe he just doesn't like going in sweden but it seemed like it would be a fun trip i think they do it in a nice time of years but hey that's his right he earned that right i think the best artists aren't doing it for the prize they aren't doing it for the fame or the money they're doing it because they love the art yeah it's the the rick rubin thing you gotta verb it through download your inner thing i don't think we've talked about this that this obsession that i have about how rick has this way of being very very still in his body but keeping his mind very active as a practice went and spent some time with him in italy last june and we would tread water in his pool in the morning and listen to history of rock and roll and hundred songs mhmm amazing podcast by the way it is yeah and and then he would spend a fair amount of time during the day you know in this kind of meditative state where his mind is very active body very still and then carl deisseroth when he came on my podcast talked about how he forces himself to sit still and think in complete sentences late at night after his kids go to sleep and you know there's a state of mind rapid eye movement sleep where your body is completely paralyzed and the mind is extremely active and people credit rapid eye movement sleep with some of the more elaborate emotion filled dreams and the source of many ideas and there are other examples einstein people described him as taking walks around the princeton campus then pausing and would ask him what was going on and the idea that his mind was continuing to churn forward at a high rate so you know this is far from controlled studies but we're talking about some incredible minds and creatives who have a practice of stilling the body while keeping the mind deliberately very active very similar to rapid eye movement sleep and then there are a lot of people who also report you know great ideas coming to them in the shower while running so it can be the opposite as well where the body is very active and the and the mind is perhaps more on kind of like a default mode network not really focusing on any one specific thing you know interesting there's a there's a bunch of physicists and mathematicians i've talked to they talk about sleep deprivation and going crazy hours through the night obsessively pursuing a thing and then the solution to the problem comes when they finally get rest right and and we know we just did this six episode special series on sleep with matt walker we know that when you deprive yourself of sleep and then you get sleep you get a rebound in rapid eye movement sleep you get a higher percentage of rapid eye movement sleep and matt talks about this in the podcast and he did an episode on sleep and creativity sleep and memory and rapid eye movement sleep comes up multiple times in that series there's also some very interesting stuff about cannabis withdrawal and rapid eye movement sleep people are coming off cannabis often will suffer from insomnia but when they finally do start sleeping they like dream like crazy cannabis is a very controversial topic right now oh yeah i saw that what happened there's a bunch of drama around the episode you did on cannabis yeah we did a episode about cannabis talked about the health benefits and the potential risks right it's it's neither here nor there depends on the person depends on the age depends on genetic background a number of other things we published that episode well over a year ago and it had no issues online so to speak and then a clip of it was put to x where you know the real action occurs as you know your favorite spot yeah yeah the the the four ounce gloves as opposed to the sixteen ounce gloves that is x versus instagram or youtube there was kind of an immediate dog pile from a few people in the cannabis research field so phds and mds yeah there were people on our side there were people not on our side i mean you know the the statement that got things riled up the most was this notion that for certain individuals there's a high potential for inducing psychosis with high thc containing cannabis for certain individuals not all that sparked some issues there was really a split you know you see this in different fields it there was one person in particular who came out swinging with language that in my opinion is not like of the sort that you would use at a university venue especially among colleagues but that's fine you know we're all grown ups well for me from my perspective it was strangely rude and it had an air of like elitism mhmm that to me was it the source of the problem during covid that led to the distrust of science and the the the popularization of disrespecting science because so many scientists spoke with an arrogance and a douchebaggery that i wish we would have a little bit less of yeah it's tough because most academics don't understand that people outside the university system are they don't they're not familiar with like the inner workings of science and and the culture and so you have to be very careful how you present when you're a university professor and when yeah so you know he came out swinging at some you know four letter word type language and he was obviously upset about it so i simply said what i would say anywhere which was hey look you come on the podcast let's chat and why don't you give your tell me where i'm wrong and let's discuss and and fortunately he agreed and initially he said well no how can i be sure you're not gonna misrepresent me and so i said we got on a d dm then a then an email then eventually phone call and just said hey listen like you're welcome to record the whole conversation we've never done a gotcha on my podcast and let's just get to the heart of the matter i think this this little controversy is perfect kindling for for a really great discussion and and he had some other conditions that we worked out and and i and i felt like cool like he's really interested although you get a very different person on the phone than you do on twitter i will say he's been very collegial and that conversation is on the schedule i said we'll fly you out we'll put you up he said no he wants to fly himself he really wants to make sure that there's like kind of a space between i think some of the perception of science and health podcasts in the academic community is that it's all designed to sell something no we run ads so it can be free to everyone else yeah but i think look in the end he agreed and i'm excited for the conversation it was interesting because in the wake of that little exchange there's been a bunch of press from traditional press about cannabis has now surpassed alcohol in men in many cultures as within the united states as when i say cultures i mean demographics the united states as the as the drug of choice there have been people highlighting the issues of potential psychosis in high thc containing and so it's kind of interesting to see how traditional media is sort of on board certain elements that you know i put forward and i think there's some controversy as to whether or not the different strains the indicas and sativas are biologically different etcetera so we'll get down into the weeds pun intended during that one and i'm excited it's the first time that we've responded to a direct criticism online about scientific content in a way that really promoted like oh here the idea of inviting a particular guest and so it's great let's get a guest to his expert in cannabis i i believe i could be wrong about this that he's a behavioral neuroscientist a slightly different training but look he seems highly credentialed it'd be fun and we you know we welcome that kind of exchange i deeply being diplomatic i'm just saying like it's cool like he's coming on no you you know and he was friendly on the phone right like he literally came out online and was like basically like kind of like f you like f this and f you but you get someone on the phone it's like hey how's it going and they're like oh yeah well you know i there was an immediate apology of like hey listen i came out normally i'm like not like that but online you know oh yeah you got a different oh yeah okay listen so it's a little bit like it's a little bit like jiu jitsu right people say all sorts of things i guess but if they if you're like alright well let's go then it's probably a different story you know it's not like jiu jitsu because in jiu jitsu people don't talk shit because they know what the consequences let me let me just say on mic and off mic you have been very respectful towards this person mhmm and i'm look up to you and respect you and admire the fact that you have been that said to me that guy was being a dick and when you graciously politely invited him on the podcast he was still talking down to you the whole time so i really admire and look forward to listening to you talk to him but i hope others don't do that like you are a positive humble voice exploring all the interesting aspects of science like you want to learn if there you've got anything wrong you wanna learn about it the way he was being a dick i was just hurt a little bit not because of him but because like there's some people i really really admire brilliant scientists that are not their best selves on twitter on x definitely i don't understand what happens to their brain well they regress they they regress and and they also are protected you know you know when you remove the i mean no scientific argument should ever come to physical blows right but when you remove the real world thing of being right in front of somebody yeah people will throw all sorts of stones at a distance you know and over a wall and they've got their their wife or their husband or their boyfriend or their dog or their cat to go cuddle with them afterwards but you get in a room and it's like you know confrontational people in real life are are pretty rare but hopefully if they do it they're like willing to back it up with knowledge in this case right we're not talking about physical altercation yeah he he kept coming and he kept putting on conditions how do i know you want this and i was like well you can record the conversation how do i know you want that listen we'll pay for you to come out how do you know and eventually he just kind of relented and and it to his credit you know he's agreed to come on i mean he still has to show up but once he does you know we'll treat him right like we would any other guest yeah you treat people really well and i i just hope that people are a little bit nicer on the internet yeah well you know x is an interesting one because you you it thickens your skin you know to just to go on there i mean you have to be ready to deal with sure but i can still criticize people for for being douchebags yep because like that's still not good inspiring behavior like especially for scientists that should be sort of symbols of scientific thinking which requires intellectual humility humility is a big part of that and twitter is a good place to illustrate that yeah yeah years ago i used to i was a student in ta then instructor and then directed a cold spring harbor course on visual neuroscience these are summer courses that explore different topics and at night we would host what we hoped were battles in front of the students where you'd get two people on a you know would it be neural prosthetics or molecular tools that would first you know restore vision to the blind kind of arguments you know kinda like it's kind of a silly argument because it's gonna be a combination of both right but you get these great arguments but the arguments were always couched in data and occasionally you'd get somebody would go like or would curse or something but it was the rare very very well placed you know insult it wasn't you know coming out swinging i think ultimately you know twitter's a record of people's behavior the the internet is a record of people's behavior and here i'm not talking about news reports about people's behavior i'm talking about how people show up online is really important you've always carried yourself with a ton of composure and respect and you know you just you would hope that people would grow from that example well i'll tell you that the the podcasters that i'm scouting it's their energy but it's also how they treat other people how they respond to comments and you know we're we're blessed to have pretty significant reach when we put out a podcast like someone else's podcast it goes far and wide so like a skateboard team like a laboratory where you're selecting people to be in your lab you're you wanna pick people that you would enjoy working with and that are collegial etiquette and etiquette is is lacking nowadays but you're in the student tie you're bringing it back bringing it back you said that your conversation with james hollis a jungian psychoanalyst had a big impact on you what do you mean james hollis is a eighty four year old jungian psychoanalyst who's written seventeen books including under saturn's shadow which is on the healing and trauma of men the eden eden project excuse me which is about relationships and creating a life i discovered james hollis in an online lecture that was recorded i think in san diego it's on youtube the audio is terrible called creating a life and this was somewhere in the twenty eleven to twenty fifteen span i can't remember and i was on my way to europe and i called my girlfriend at the time i was like i just found the most incredible lecture i've ever heard and i he talks about the shadow he talks about your developmental upbringing and how you either align with or go a hundred and eighty degrees off your parents' tendencies and values in certain areas he talked about the specific questions to ask of oneself at different stages of life to live a full life so it's always been a dream of mine to meet him and to record a podcast and he wasn't able to travel so our team went out to dc and sat down with him we rarely do that nowadays people come to our studio and he came in he had had some surgeries recently and he kinda came in with some assistance from a you know a cane and then sat down and just just blew my mind from start to finish he didn't miss a syllable and every sentence that he spoke was like a quotable sentence of with real potency and actionable items i think one of the things that was most striking to me was how he said when we take ourselves out of stimulus and response and we just force ourselves to spend some time in the quiet of our thoughts while walking or while seated or while lying down doesn't have to be meditation but it could be that we access our unconscious mind in ways that reveals to us who we really are and what we really want and that if we do that practice repeatedly ten minutes a day here fifteen minutes a day there that we start to really touch into our unique gifts and the things that make us each us and the directions we need to take but that so often we just stay in stimulus response we just do do do do do which is great we have to be productive but we miss those important messages and interestingly he also put forward this idea of what is this like get up shut up suit up yeah something like that like get out of bed suit up and shut up and get to work he also has that in him kind of a goggins type mindset so be able to turn off all this self reflection and self analysis and just get shit done get shit done but then also take dedicated time and stop and just let stuff geyser to the surface from the unconscious mind and he quotes shakespeare and he quotes jung and he quotes everybody through history with with incredible accuracy and and in exactly the way needed to drive home a point but that conversation to me was one that i really felt like okay you know if i don't wake up tomorrow for whatever reason that one's in the can and i feel really great about it it's it to me it's the most important guest recording we've ever done in particular because he has wisdom and while i hope he lives to be two hundred and four chances are he's got another what twenty thirty years with us hopefully more but i really really wanted to capture that information and get it out there so i'm very very proud of that one and he's the kind of guy that anyone listens to him young old male female whatever and you're gonna get something of value what do you think about this idea of the shadow that the good and the bad that we repress that hides from plain sight when we analyze ourselves that's there you think there's like a ocean that we we don't have direct access to yes yeah well jung said it we have all things inside of us and we do and some people are more in touch with those than others and some people it's repressed i mean does that mean that we could all be you know horrible people or marvelous people benevolent people perhaps i think that thankfully more often than not people lean away from the like violent and harmful parts of their their shadow but i think spending time thinking about you know one's shadow shadows is super important how how else are we going to grow otherwise you know we have these unconscious blind spots of of denial or repression or whatever you know the psychiatrists tell us but yeah it clearly exists within all of us i mean we have neural circuits for rage we all do we have neural circuits for altruism and no one's born without these things and some people they're atrophied and some people they're hypertrophied but looking inward and and recognizing what's there is key or positive things like creativity maybe that's what rick rubin is accessing when he goes silent silent body active mind mhmm that's interesting what is it for you what place do you go to that generates ideas that helps you generate ideas i have a lot of new practices around this i mean i'm all like always exploring for protocols i have to it's like in my nature when when i went and spent time with rick i i tried to adopt his practice of staying very still and just letting stuff come to the surface or the dysarthean way of formulating complete sentences in while being still in the body what i have found works better is what my good friend tim armstrong does to write music he writes music every day he's a music producer he's obviously a singer guitar player for rancid and he's helped dozens and dozens and dozens of female pop artists and punk rock artists write great songs and many of the famous songs that you've heard from other artists tim helped them write tim wakes up sometimes in the middle of the night and what he does is he'll start drawing or painting so what he's done and joni mitchell talks about this too you find some creative outlet that's like fifteen degrees off center from your main creative outlet and you do that thing so for me that's drawing i like doing anatomical drawings neuroscience based drawing drawing neurons that kind of thing and if i do that for a little while it my mind starts churning on the the nervous system and biology and then i come up with areas i'd like to explore for the podcast ways i'd like to address certain topics right now i'm very interested in autonomic control a beautiful paper came out that shows that anyone can learn to control their pupil sizes without changing luminance through a biofeedback mechanism and that gives them auto control over their so called automatic autonomic nervous system and i've been looking at what the circuitry is and it's it's beautiful so i'll draw the circuitry that we know underlies autonomic function and as i'm doing that i'm thinking oh like what about autonomic control and those people that supposedly can control their pupil size then you go in and there's a paper published in nature press one of the nature journals and there's a recent paper on this like oh cool and then we talk about this and then how could this be put into a kind of a post or how could this you know so doing things that are about fifteen degrees off center from your main thing is a great way to access i believe that the circuits for in tim's case painting goes to songwriting i think for joni mitchell that was also the case right i think it was drawing and painting to singing and songwriting for rick i don't know what it is maybe it's listening to podcasts i don't know that that's his business do you have anything that you like to focus on that allows you then an easier transition into your main creative work no i'd really like to focus on emptiness and silence so i pick the dragon i have to slay so whatever the problem i have to work on and then just sit there and stare at it i love how fucking linear you are and it just and if there's no if you're tired i'll just sit i believe in the in the power of just waiting and usually i'll stop being tired or it their energy rises from somewhere or an idea pops from somewhere but there needs to be a silence and an emptiness it's an empty room just me and the dragon and we wait that's it like if it's a usually with programming you're thinking about a particular design like how do i design this thing to solve this problem any cognitive enhancers i've got a quite the gallery in front of me oh that's right yeah should should we walk through this yeah alright this is not this is not a a sales thing it's just i tend to do this bounce back and forth your refrigerator just happened to have a lot of different choices so water this is all of my refrigerator i know right there's no food in there there's water there's element which they now have canned yeah and yes they're a podcast sponsor for both of us but that's not why i cracked one of these open i like them provided they're they're cold and that's by the way my least favorite flavors i was saying that's that's the reason it's still left in the fridge the cherry one is really good the black cherry good there's a orange one yeah i pushed the the sled this morning and pulled the sled from my workout at the gym and and it was hot today here in austin so some salt is good and then matina yerba mate zero sugar full confession i helped develop this i'm a partial owner but i love yerba mate half argentine been drinking mate since i was a little kid there's actually a photo somewhere on the internet when i'm like three sitting on my grandfather's lap sipping mate out the gourd and then this my fun interesting this is just a little bit of coffee with a scoop of brian johnson gave me cocoa just like pure unsweetened cocoa mhmm so i put that in chocolate and i like it it just for the taste well it actually nukes my appetite and since i'm we're not going out to dinner tonight until later i figure that's good yeah brian's an interesting one right he's really pushing this this thing the optimization of everything although he just hurt his ankle he posted a photo that he hurt his ankle so now he's injecting bpc body protection compound one five seven which many many people are taking by the way i did an episode on peptides mhmm i should just say you know bpc one five seven one of the known effects in animal models is angiogenesis like development of new vasculature which can be great in some context but also if you have a tumor you don't really wanna vascularize that tumor anymore so i worry about people taking bpc one five seven continually but and there's very little human data i think there's like one study and it's a lousy one so a lot of animal data some of the peptides are interesting however there's one that i've experimented with a little bit called pinealin which i find even if i've just taken it twice a week before sleep then it times it seems to do something to the circadian timekeeping mechanism because then on other days when i don't take it i get unbelievably tired at that time that normally i would do the injection these are things that i'll experiment with for a couple weeks and then typically stop maybe try something else but i stay out of things that really stimulate any of the major hormone pathways when it comes to peptides that's actually a really good question of how do you experiment like how long do you try a thing to figure out if it works for you well i'm very sensitive to these things so i and i have been doing a lot of things for a long time so if i add something in it's always one thing at a time and i notice right away if it does not make me feel good like there's a lot of excitement about some of the so called growth hormone secretagogues ipramuralin testamorel and sirmorel and i've experimented a little bit with those in the past and they've nuked my rapid eye movement sleep they're giving me a lot of deep sleep which doesn't feel good to me but other people like them i also just generally try and avoid taking peptides that tap into these hormone pathways because you can run into all sorts of issues but some people take them safely but usually after about four or five days i know if i like something or i don't and then i move on but i am not super adventurous with these things i know people that will take cocktails of peptides with multiple things they'll try anything that's not me and i do blood work but also i'm you know i'm mainly reading papers and podcasting and i'm teaching a course next spring stanford i'm gonna do a big undergraduate course so i'm trying to develop that course and things like that so i don't need to lift more weight or run further than i already do which is not that much weight or or far as it is right you're not going to the olympics you're not trying to no truly maximize some aspect of your performance no and i'm not and i'm not trying to get down below whatever you know seven percent body fat or something i i don't have those kinds of goals so hydration electrolytes caffeine in the form of mate and then this coffee thing and then and then here's one that i think i brought out for discussion this is a piece of nicorette they're not a sponsor nicotine is an interesting compound it will raise blood pressure and it is probably not safe for everybody but you know the nicotine is gaining in popularity like crazy mainly these pouches that people put in the lip not we're not talking about smoking vaping dipping or snuffing you know my interest in nicotine started this was in twenty ten i was visiting columbia medical school and i was in the office of the great neurobiologist richard axel won the nobel prize corecipient with linda buck for the discovery of the molecular basis of olfaction brilliant guy he's probably in his late seventies now probably yeah and he kept popping nicorette in his mouth mhmm and i was like what's this about and he said oh well this was just anecdote right but he said but he said this he said oh well you know it protects against parkinson's and alzheimer's i said it does and he goes yeah yeah yeah i don't know if he was kidding or not he's known for making jokes and then he said that when he used to smoke it really helped his focus and creativity but then he quit smoking because he didn't want lung cancer and he found that he couldn't focus as well so he would choose nicorette so occasionally like right now we'll each i do a half a piece but i'm not russian so i'm a little you know yeah did you just pop the whole thing in your mouth mhmm so i'll do a couple milligrams every now and again and it definitely sharpens the mind on an empty stomach in particular but you fast all day you're still doing one meal a day one meal a day yeah yeah i did a nicotine pouch with rogan at dinner and it got high yeah that's a lot that's like usually six or eight milligrams i know people that get a canister of zyn take one a day pretty soon they're taking a canister a day so you have to be very careful i will only allow myself two pieces of nicorette total per week and you will notice that you know in the day after you use it you know sometimes your your throat will feel a little bit like like a little spasm y like you might wanna cough once or twice and so you know if you're a singer or you're podcaster or something you have to do long podcast you wanna just be mindful of it but yeah you're supposed to kinda like keep it in your cheek and you know here we go but it did make me intensely focused mhmm in a way that was a little bit scary because the nucleus basalis is in the you know in basal forebrain nucleus has cholinergic neurons that radiate out axons little wires that release acetylcholine into the neocortex and elsewhere and when you focus on one particular topic matter or one particular area of your visual field or listening to something and focusing visually we know that there's a an elaboration of the amount of acetylcholine released there and it binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor sites there so it's a kind of a attentional modulation by acetylcholine so you're getting in with nicotine you're getting a exogenous or artificial heightening of that circuitry and the time i had tucker carlson on the podcast he told me that apparently it helps him as he said publicly keep his love life vibrant really it caused vasoconstriction well he literally said it makes his dick very hard he said that publicly also okay well as little as i wanna think about tucker carlson's trust me sex life no disrespect the major effect of nicotine on the vasculature my understanding is that it causes vasoconstriction not vasodilation drugs like cialis tadalafil viagra etcetera vasodilators they allow more blood flow nicotine does the opposite less blood flow to the periphery but provided dosages are kept low and i i don't recommend people use it frequently or at all and i don't recommend young people use it you know you know twenty five and younger brain's very plastic at that time and and certainly smoking dipping vaping it's nothing aren't good because you're gonna run into you will run into trouble for other reasons but in any case oh and even there vaping is a controversial topic probably safer than smoking but has its own issues and i said something like that and boy did i catch a lot of heat for that can't say anything as a health science educator and not piss somebody off yeah it just depends on where the the center of mass is and how far outside that you are for me the caffeine is the main thing and actually it's a it's a really big part of my life and one of the things you recommend that people wait a bit in the morning oh yeah to consume caffeine if they experience a crash in the afternoon the this is one of the misconceptions i i regret maybe even discussing it for people that crash in the afternoon oftentimes if they delay their caffeine by sixty to ninety minutes in the morning they will offset some of that but if you eat a lunch that's too big or you didn't sleep well the night before you're not gonna avoid that afternoon crash but i'll wake up sometimes and go straight to hydration and caffeine especially if i'm gonna work out here's a weird one if i exercise before eight thirty am especially if i start exercising when i'm a little bit tired i get energy that lasts all day if i wait until my peak of energy which is midmorning ten am eleven am and i start exercising then i'm basically exhausted all afternoon and i don't understand why i mean it depends on the intensity of the workout but so i like to be done showered and heading into work by nine am but i don't always meet that more so you're saying it doesn't affect your energy if you start with exercising i think you can get energy and wake yourself up with exercise if you start early and it and then that fuels you all day long i think that if you wait until you're feeling at your best to train sometimes that's detrimental because then in the afternoon when you're doing like the work we get paid for like research podcasting etcetera then oftentimes you know your your brain isn't firing as well that's interesting i haven't really rigorously tried that wake up and just start running or listening the jocko thing and then there's this phenomenon called entrainment where if you force yourself to exercise or eat or socialize or view bright light at a certain time of day for three to seven days in a row pretty soon there's an anticipatory circuit that gets generated this is why anyone in theory can become a morning person to some degree or another and this is also a beautiful example of why you wake up before your alarm clock goes off you know when people wake up and all of a sudden it goes off it wasn't because it clicked it's because you have this incredible timekeeping mechanism that exists in sleep and there's some papers that have been published in the last couple of years nature neuroscience and elsewhere showing that people can answer math problems in their sleep simple math problems but math problems nonetheless this does not mean that if you ask your partner a question in sleep that they're gonna answer accurately like they might screw up the whole cumulative probability of twenty percent across multiple months alright listen what happened what happened here's the deal a few years back i did a four and a half hour after editing four and a half hour episode on male and female fertility the entire recording took eleven hours and at one point during the and and by the way i'm very proud of that episode there's many couples have written to me and said they now have children as a consequence of that episode and my first question is what were you doing during the episode but in all seriousness we should say that it's four and a half hours yeah and for people then they should listen to the episode you're it's extremely technical episode like you're nonstop dropping facts and and referencing huge number of papers it's must be exhaust i don't understand how you can possibly about sperm health spermatogenesis it talks about the ovulatory cycle it talks about things people can do that are that are considered absolutely supported by science it talks about some of the things kind of out on the edge a little bit that are a little bit more experimental it talks about ivf it talks about icsi it talks about all of that it talks about frequency of pregnancy as a function of age etcetera but there's this one portion there in the podcast where i'm talking about the probability of a successful pregnancy as a function of age and so there was a clip that was cut in which i was describing cumulative probability and by the way we've published cumulative probability histograms in many of my laboratories papers including one that was a nature article in twenty eighteen so we run these all the time and yes i know the difference between independent and cumulative probability okay that's just like i do the way the clip was cut and what i stated unfortunately combined to a like a pretty great gaffe mhmm where i say you're just adding purse i said you're just adding percentages twenty twenty twenty to a hundred and twenty percent and then i made a kind of unfortunately my humor isn't always so good and i made a joke i said hundred and twenty percent but that's a different thing altogether mhmm what i should have said was that's impossible you know and here here's how it actually works but then the the it continues where i then describe the cumulative probability histogram for successful pregnancy but somewhere in the early portion i i misstated something right i made a math error which implied i didn't understand the difference between independent and cumulative probability mhmm which i do and it got picked up and and run and people had a really good laugh with that one at my expense and so what i did in response to it was rather than just say everything i just said now i said i just came out online and said hey folks in an episode dated this on fertility i made a math error here is the formula for cumulative probability successful pregnancy at that age here's the graph here's the you know and and i i offered it as a teaching moment in two ways one for people to understand cumulative probability it was sort of interesting too a number of people had come out critiquing the gaf also like and folks came out pointing out that they didn't understand cumulative probability so there was a lot of posturing you know the dog pile oftentimes people are quick to dog pile they didn't understand but a lot of people did understand there's some some smart people out there obviously i i called my dad and he was just laughing he goes oh this is good this is like the old school way of of hammering academics but the point being it was a teaching moment gave me an opportunity to say hey i made a mistake i also made a mistake in another podcast where i did a micron to millimeter conversion and or centimeter conversion but and we always correct these in the show note captions we correct them in the audio now unfortunately on youtube it's harder to correct you can't go and edit in segments so we put in the captions but that was the one teaching moment if you make a mistake it's substantive and related to data you you you apologize and correct the mistake use it as teaching moment the other one was to say hey you know in all the thousands of hours of content we've put out i'm sure i've made some small errors i think i once said serotonin when i meant dopamine and you know you're you're going you're you're riffing and it's a reminder to be careful to edit double check but the internet usually edits for us and then we go make corrections but it didn't feel good at first but ultimately you know i can laugh at myself about it long ago at berkeley when i was ta ing my first class it was a biopsychology class between nineteen ninety eight or nineteen ninety nine i was drawing the pituitary gland which is you know has an anterior and a posterior lobe actually has a medial lobe too i have five six hundred students in that lecture hall and i drew it was chalkboard and i drew the two lobes of the pituitary and i said my back was to the audience i said you know and so they just sort of hang there mhmm and everyone just erupted in laughter because it looked like a scrotum with two testicles and i remember thinking like oh my god like i don't think i can turn around i can face this you know and like oh i gotta turn around sooner or later so i turned around and we just all had a big laugh together mhmm it was embarrassing i'll tell you one thing though they never forgot about the two lobes of the pituitary yeah and you haven't forgotten about that either right there's a high high salience for these kinds of things and it also was kind of fun to see how excited people get mhmm to see people trip it's like an elite sprinter trips and does something stupid like you know runs the opposite direction out the blocks or something like that and and or you know i recall at one world cup match years ago a guy scored against his own team i think they killed the guy do you remember that mhmm some south american or central american team yeah and they killed the guy but yeah let's let's look it up i just said world cup yeah he was gunned down andres escobar yeah scored against his own team in nineteen ninety four world cup in the united states just twenty seven years old playing for the columbia national team yeah last name escobar it's a good name think it would protect you listen you know so there are some gaps that get people killed right so you know how forgiving are we for online mistakes you know i i just the nature of the mistakes people were quite gracious about the the gap and some weren't and you know it's interesting that we as you know public health science educators you know we'll do long podcast sometimes and and you need to be really careful what's great is ai mhmm allows you to check these things now more readily so that's cool and there are ways that that it's now gonna be more self correcting i mean you know i think there's a there's a lot of errors out there on the internet and people are finding them and it's cool like things are getting cleaned up yeah but mistakes nevertheless will happen are you do you feel the pressure of not making mistakes sure i mean you know i try and get things right to the best of you know to the best of my ability i check with experts it's kind of interesting when people really don't like something that was said in a podcast a lot of times i chuckle because i'm you know at stanford we have some amazing scientists but there i talk to them else people elsewhere and it's always interesting to me how you know i'll get divergent information and then i'll find the overlap in the venn diagram and i have this like question do i just stay with the overlap in the venn diagram like i did an episode on oral health i didn't know this until i researched that episode but oral health is critically related to heart health and brain health that there's a bacteria that causes cavities streptococcus you know that can make its way into other parts of the body through the mouth that can cause serious issues there's the idea that some forms of dementia some forms of heart disease are start in the mouth basically i talked to no fewer than four dentists dental experts and there was a lot of convergence i also learned that teeth can demineralize that's the formation of cavities they can also remineralize as long as the cavity isn't too deep it can actually fill itself back in especially if you provide the right substrates for it that saliva is this incredible fluid that has all this capacity to remineralize teeth provided the milieu is right things like alcohol based mouthwashes killing off some of the critical things you need it's fascinating and i put out that episode thinking oh well i'm not a dentist i'm not an oral health episode but i talked to a pediatric dentist there's a terrific one doctor downscore staci s t a c i on instagram does great content talked to some others and like and then i just waited for the attack i was like here we go and it didn't come and dentists were thanking me i was like you know mhmm that's a rare thing more often than not if i do an episode about say psilocybin or mdma you get some people liking it or adhd and the drugs for adhd we did a whole episode on the ritalin vyvanse adderall stuff you get people saying thank you you know i prescribed this to my kid and it really helps and and this and i but they're private about the fact that they do it because they catch so much attack from other people so i like to find the center of mass report that try and make it as clear as possible and then i know that there's some stuff where i'm gonna catch shit what's frustrating for me is when like i see claims that i'm like against fluoridation of water which i'm not right like we talked about the benefits of fluoride it builds hyper strong bonds within the teeth i went and looked at some of the the literally the crystal struck not excuse me not the crystal struck structure but the the essentially the like micron and submicron structure of teeth is incredible and where fluoride can get in there and form these super strong bonds and you can also form them with things like hydroxyapatite and why is there fluoride in water well it's the best okay you get you say some things that are interesting but then somehow it gets turned into like you're against fluoridation which i'm not or i've been accused of being against sunscreen i wear mineral based sunscreen on my face i don't wanna get skin cancer or i use a physical barrier there is a cohort of people out there that think that all sunscreens are bad i'm not one of them i'm not what's called a sunscreen truther but then you get attacked for like if you so we're talking about there are certain sunscreens that are problematic so what and rhonda patrick's now starting to get vocal about this and so there's certain topics that's interesting for which you have to listen carefully to what somebody is saying but there's a lumper or lumping as opposed to splitting of of of what health educators say and so it just seems like like with politics there's this like urgency to just put people into a camp of expert versus like renegade or something and it's not like that it's just not like that so i the short answer is i really strive really strive to get things right but i know that i'm gonna piss certain people off and you've taught me and joe's taught me and other podcasters have taught me that like if you worry too much about it then you aren't gonna get the newest information out there like peptides there's very little human data unless you're talking about vyleesi or the melana you know stuff in the alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone stuff which are prescribed for female libido to enhance female libido or sirmirelin which is for certain growth hormone deficiencies with with rare exception there's very little human data but people are still super interested and a lot of people are taking and doing these things so you you wanna get the information out do you try to not just look at the science but research what the communities are talk what the various communities are talking about like maybe research what the conspiracy theorists are talking about just so you know all the armies that are going to be attacking your castle yes so like for instance there is a community of people online that believe that like if you consume seed oils or something that like you're setting up your skin for sunburn and if you don't you know like there's all these like theories but i like to so i like to know what the theories are i like to know what the extremes are but i also like to know what the standard conversation is but there's generally more agreement than disagreement i think where you know i've been kind of bullish actually is you know or like supplements like people go oh supplements well there's food supplements like a protein powder which is different than a vitamin and then they are compounds there are compounds that have real benefit but people get very nervous about the fact that they're not regulated but some of them are are vetted with for potency and for safety with with more rigor than others you know and it's interesting to see how people who take care of themselves and put a lot of work into that are often attacked that's been interesting also one of the most controversial topics nowadays is ozempic monjaro i'm very middle of the road on this i don't understand why the quote unquote health wellness community is so against these things i also don't understand why they have to be looked at as the only route for some people they've really helped them lose weight and yes there can be some muscle loss and other lean lean body loss but that can be offset with resistance training they've helped a lot of people and other people are like no this stuff is terrible i think the most interesting thing about ozempic monjara is that they are glp one they're in the glp one pathway glucagon like peptide one and it was discovered in gila monsters which is a lizard basically and someone the now the now the entomologist will dive on me it's a big big lizard looking thing that doesn't eat very often and they figured out that there's this peptide that allows it to curb its own appetite at the level of the brain and the gut and it has a lot of homology to sequence homology to what we now call glp one so i love anytime there's animal biology links to cool human biology links to a a drug that's powerful that can help people with obesity and type two diabetes and there's evidence that can even curb some addictions those are newer data but i don't see as either or in fact i've been a little bit disappointed at the way that the whatever you wanna call it health wellness biohacking community has like slammed on ozempic monjaro it's like they're like just get out and run and do listen there are people who are carrying substantial amounts of weight that running could injure them they get on these drugs and they can improve and then hopefully they're also doing resistance training and eating better and then you know you're bringing all the elements together well why do you think the criticism is happening is it that ozempic became super popular so people are misusing it or that kind of thing no i think what it is is that people think if it's a pharmaceutical it's bad yeah and then or if it's a supplement it's bad depending on which camp they're in and and wouldn't it be wonderful to kinda like fill in the gap between this divide you know what i would like to see in politics and in health is neither right nor left but what we can just call a league of reasonable people that looks at things on an issue by issue basis and fills in the center because i think most people are in the are i don't wanna say center in a political way but i think most people are reasonable they want to be reasonable but that's not what sells clicks that's not what that's not what drives interest but i'm a very like like i look at issue by issue person by person i don't like in group out group stuff i never have i've got friends from all walks of life i've said this on other podcast and it always sounds like a like a political statement but like the the the push towards like you know polarization is it's so frustrating if there's one thing that's discouraging to me as as i get older each year i'm like wow were we ever gonna get out of this like polarization speaking of which how are you gonna vote for the presidential election i'm i'm still trying to figure out how to interview the people involved and do it well what do you think the role of podcast is gonna be in this year's election i would love long form conversations to happen with the with the candidates i think it's gonna be huge i would love trump to go on rogan i would i'm embarrassed to say this but i would love to honestly would love to see joe biden go on joe rogan also i would imagine that both would go on but separately separately i think it's i think a debate joe does debates but i think joe at his best is one on one conversation really intimate i i just wish that joe biden would actually do long form conversations i thought he had done a it wasn't me i think it was on jay shetty's podcast he did jay shetty he did he did a few but when i mean long form i mean really long form like two three hours and more relaxed it was much more orchestrated because what happens when it's the interview is a little bit too short it becomes into this generic political type of nbc cnn type of interview you get a set of questions and you don't get to really feel the human expose the human to the light in at the full we talked about the shadow the good the bad and the ugly so i think there's something magical about two three four hours mhmm but it doesn't have to be that long but it has to have that feeling to it where there's not people standing around and everybody's nervous and you're going to be strictly sticking to the question answer type of feel but just shooting shit which rogan is the best by far in the world at that yeah he's i i don't think people really appreciate how skilled he is at what he does and the number i mean the three or four podcast per week plus plus the ufc announcing plus comedy tours in stadiums plus you know doing comedy shows in the the middle of the week plus you know husband and a father and a friend and jujitsu the guy's got like superhuman levels of output i i agree that long form conversation is a whole other business and i think that people want and deserve to know the people that are running for office at a in a different way and to really get to know them well listen you know i i guess you i mean is it clear that he's gonna do jail time or maybe he gets away with the line i'm part of it gonna say i mean does that mean you're gonna be podcasting from in prison yeah jail we're going to in fact i'm going to figure out how to commit a crime so i can get in prison with please don't please don't well that's yeah i'm sure they have visitors right that just doesn't feel an authentic way to get the interview but yeah i understand you wouldn't be able to wear that suit you'd be wearing a different suit that's true yeah that's true it's gonna be interesting and and you do i'm not just saying this because you're my friend but you would do a marvelous job i think you should sit down with all of them separately to keep it civil and and see what what happens i think here's one thing that i found really interesting in this whole political landscape when i'm in los angeles i often get invited to these like they're not dinners but gatherings where you know a local you know bunch of podcasters will come together but a lot of people from the entertainment industry big agencies big tech like big big tech many of the people have been on this podcast and they'll host a discussion or a debate and what you find if you look around the room and you talk to people is that about half the people in the room are very left leaning and very outspoken about that and they'll tell you exactly who they wanna see in the in the win the presidential race and the other half will tell you that they're for the other side a lot of people that people assume are on one side of the aisle or the other are in the exact opposite side now some people are very open about who they're who they're for but it's been very interesting to see how when you get people one on one they're like telling you they want x candidate to win or y candidate to win and sometimes i'm like really i can't believe it like are you mhmm i'm like yep and so it's what people think about people's political leanings is often exactly wrong and and that's been eye opening for me and i've seen that in university campuses too and and so it's it's gonna be really really interesting to see what happens in in november in addition to that as you said most people are close to the center despite what twitter makes it seem like most people whether they're center left or center right they're kinda close to the center yeah i mean here's the to me the most interesting question who is gonna be the next big candidate in years to come like who's that going to be right now i don't i don't i don't see or know of that person who's it gonna be yeah the young promising candidates we're not seeing them we're not seeing like who another way to ask that question who would want to be well that's the issue right you know it who wants to live in this twelve hour news cycle where you're just trying to you know dunk on the other team so that nobody notices like the your the the shit that you fucked up you know like that that's not like that's not only not fun or interesting it also is just like it's gotta be psychosis inducing at some point and i think that you know god willing we're gonna you know some young guy or woman is like on this and refuses to to back down and was just like determined to be president and we'll make it happen but like i don't even know who the viable candidates are maybe you lux you know we should ask sagar sagar would know yeah yeah maybe sagar himself sagar's show is awesome yeah it is crystal do a great thing he's incredible especially since they have somewhat divergent opinions on them yeah that's what makes it so cool he's great he looks great in a suit looks real sexy taking real good care of himself he i think he's getting married soon congratulations forgive me for not remembering your your wife future wife's name but he he won my heart by giving me a a biography of hitler as a present that's what he gave you yeah i gave you a a hatchet with a poem inscribed shows the fundamental difference with a with a poem inscribed in it which was pretty damn good i realize everything we bring up on the screen is like really depressing like the soccer player getting killed can we bring up something happy sure let's go to nature's metal instagram those are pretty intense we actually did a collaborative post on a on a shark thing really yeah what kind of shark thing so to generate the fear vr stimulus from my lab in twenty was it yeah twenty sixteen we went down to guadalupe island off the coast of mexico me and a guy named michael mueller who's a very famous portrait photographer but also takes photos of sharks and we used three sixty video to build vr of great white sharks brought it back to the lab we published that study in current biology in twenty seventeen went back down there and that was the year that i exited the cage they you lower the cage with a crane and that year i exited exited the cage i had a whole mess with a air failure the day before i was breathing from a hookah line while in the cage i had no scuba on divers were out the thing got boa constricted up and i had an air failure and i had to actually share air and it was a whole mess story for another time but the next day because i didn't wanna get ptsd and it was pretty scary the next day i cage exited with some other divers and and it turns out with these great white sharks in guadalupe the the water's very clear and you can swim toward them and then they'll they'll veer off you if you swim toward them otherwise they see you as prey well in the evening you've brought all the cages up and you're hopefully all alive and we were hanging out fishing for tuna we had a one of the the crew on board had a a line in the water and was fishing for tuna for dinner and a shark took the tuna off the line mhmm and it's a it's a very dramatic take and you can see the the just absolute size of these great white sharks the the waters there are filled with them that's the one but look so this video just the neuralink link was shot by matt mcdougall who is the head neurosurgeon at neuralink there it is takes it now believe it or not it looks like it missed like it didn't get the fish it actually just cut that thing like a band saw so i'm up on the deck with matt yeah and so when you look at it from the side you you really get a sense of this of the the girth of this freaking thing so as it comes up if you pop okay size of that thing and they move through the water with such speed just a couple so when you're in the cage and the cage is lowered down below the surface they're they're going around you're not allowed to chum the water there some people do it but and then when you cage eggs it they're like what are you doing out here and then you know they you swim toward them they veer off but what's interesting is that if you look at how they move through the water mhmm all it takes for one of these great white sharks when it sees a tuna or something it wants to eat is like two flicks of the tail mhmm and becomes like a missile mhmm it's just unbelievable economy of effort and ocean ramsey who is in my opinion the greatest of all cage exit shark divers this woman who dove with enormous great white sharks she really understands their behavior when they're aggressive when they're not gonna be aggressive she and her husband juan i believe his name is do they understand how the tiger sharks differ from the great white sharks we were down there basically like not understanding any of this we never should have been there and actually the air failure the day before plus cage exiting the next day i told myself after coming up from the cage exit that's it i'm no longer taking risks with my life i wanna live got back across the border couple days later and i was like that's it i i don't take risks with my life any longer but yeah mcdougal matt mcdougal shot that video and then it went quote unquote viral through nature's metal we passed them that video i actually i saw a video where an instructor was explaining how to behave with a shark in the water and that you don't wanna be swimming away because then you're acting like a prey that's right and then you wanna be acting like a predator by looking at it and swimming towards it right towards them and they'll bank off now if you don't see them they're ambush predators they're you know swimming in the surface and apparently if they get close you should just like guide them away by yeah like grabbing them and moving them away some people will actually roll them but if they're coming in full speedy you're not gonna roll the shark but here we are back to dark stuff again i like the shark attack map and the shark attack map shows that you know northern california there were a couple actually a guy's head got taken off he was swimming north of san francisco there's been a couple in northern california that was really tragic but most of them are in florida and australia florida same with that foundation shark attack map there it is yeah had they have a great map there you go so they look like i mean they have all the scars on them so if you if you zoom in on i mean look look at this if you go to the north america look at skulls there's there's a yeah where there where there are deadly attacks but in yeah northern california sadly this is really tragic if you zoom in on this one i read about this this guy if you can click the link fifty two year old male he was in chest high water this is just tragic i feel so sad for him and his family you know he's just three members of the party chose to go in he was you know nine i was in his chest high water twenty five to fifty yards from shore great breach of water seized his head and that was it you know so it does happen it's very infrequent if you don't go in the ocean it's a very very very low probability but but if it it doesn't happen six times in a row no i'm sorry a hundred and twenty percent chance yeah who do you think wins a saltwater crocodile or a shark shark okay i do not like saltwater crocodiles they scare me to know and mueller michael mueller who dove all over the world he sent me a picture of him diving with salty's saltwater crocs in cuba it was a smaller one but goodness gracious have you seen the size of some of those saltwater crocs i have yeah they're great i'm thinking i'm thinking the the sharks are so agile they're amazing they've head cammed one or body cammed one moving through the kelp bed and you look and it's just they're so agile moving through the water and and it's looking up at the surface like the camera's looking at the surface and you just realize if you're out there you're not and you're swimming and you get hit by a by a shark you're you're not i was gonna talk shit and say that a salty has way more bite force but according to the internet recently data indicates that the shark has a stronger bite so i i was i was assuming that a crocodile would have a a stronger bite force and therefore agility doesn't matter but apparently a shark yeah and and turning one of those big stalties is is probably not that you know turning around it's like a battleship i mean those sharks are unbelievable they can hit from all sorts oh and they they do this thing we saw this you you're out of the cage or in the cage and you and you'll look at one and and you'll see its eye kind of like looking at you they can't really fovee it but they'll look at you and you're tracking it and then you'll look down and you'll realize that one's coming at you they're they're they're ambush prayers they're working together they're it's fascinating i like i like how you know that they can't foveate right you're already considering the vision system there yeah and it's a very primitive eyes on very primitive eyes on the side of the head their vision is decent enough they're mostly obviously sensing things with their electro sensing in the water but also olfaction yeah i spend far too much time thinking about and learning about the the visual systems of different animals if you get me going on this like we'll be here all night see this is why i have the smegle out onto i saw this in a store and i got it because this is from a shark goodness yeah i can't say i ever saw one with teeth this big but it's beautiful it's beautiful yeah it's probably you know probably your blood pressure just goes and you you don't feel feel a thing yeah it's not good before we went down for the cage exit a guy in our crew pat doss who's very experienced diver asked one of the south african divers that so what you know like what's the contingency plan if like somebody catches a bite and they were like he was like every man for himself and they're like basically saying like if somebody catches a bite like that's it yeah you know anyway i thought we were gonna bring up something happy oh that is happy well we nature is beautiful yeah well nature is beautiful we lived but you know that there are there are happy things you brought up nature as metal this this is the difference between russian yeah americans and americans it's like maybe this is actually a good time to bring up your ayahuasca journey i've never done ayahuasca but i'm curious about it i'm also curious about ibogaine iboga but you told me that you did ayahuasca and that for you it wasn't the dark scary ride that it is for everybody else yeah it was an incredible experience for me i did it twice actually and have you done high dose psilocybin never no i just did yeah small dose psilocybin a couple times yeah so i was you know nervous about it i was very yeah understand that so i've done high dose psilocybin it's terrifying but i've always gotten something very useful out of it so i mean i was nervous about like whatever demons might hide in the shadow and the union in the shadow like i was i was nervous but yeah i think it turns out i don't know what the lesson is to draw from that but my experience be boys russian it must must be the russian thing i mean there's also something to the jungle there it strips away all the bullshit of life and you're just there i i forgot the outside civilization exists i forgot time because like when you don't have your phone you don't have meetings or calls or whatever you you lose a sense of time the sun comes up the sun comes down that's the the fundamental biological timer you know every mammalian species has a short wavelength so you think like blue uv type but like absorbing cone and a longer wavelength absorbing cone and the and it does this interesting subtraction to designate when it's morning and evening because when the sun is low in the sky you've got short wavelength and long wavelength light like when you look at a sunrise it's got blues and yellows orange and yellows you look in the evening reds orange and and blues and in the middle of the day it's like full spectrum light now it's always full spectrum light but because of some atmospheric elements and because of the low solar angle you like the that difference between the the different wavelengths of light is is the fundamental signal that the neurons in your eye pay attention to and and signal to your circadian timekeeping mechanism like we are at the core of our brain in the suprachiasmatic nucleus we are we are like wired to be entrained to the rising and setting of the sun mhmm like that's the biological timer which makes perfect sense because you know obviously as the planets as the planets spin and revolve i also wonder like how that is affected by you know in the rainforest the sun is not visible often so you're under the cover of of the trees so maybe that affects well their social rhythms their feeding rhythms sometimes in in terms of some species will signal the timing of activity of other species and but yeah getting out from the canopy is is critical of course even under the canopy during the daytime there's far more photons than at night you know there's always when i'm telling people to get sunlight in their eyes in the morning and in the evening people say there's no light no sunlight this time here i'm like go outside on a really overcast day it's far brighter than it is at night right so there's still lots of sunlight even if you can't see the sun as an object but i i love time perception shifts and you mentioned that in the jungle it's linked to the rising and setting of the sun you also mentioned that on ayahuasca you zoomed out from from the earth these these are like to me the most interesting aspects of having a human brain as opposed to another brain of course we only ever had a human brain but which is that you can consciously set your time domain window like you can we can be focused here we can be focused on all of austin or we could be focused on the entire planet you can make those choices consciously but in the time domain it's it's hard like different activities bring us into fine slicing or more or more broad bending of time depending on what we're doing programming or exercising or researching or podcasting but just how unbelievably fluid the human brain is in terms of its the aperture of of the time space window of our cognition and of our experience and i i feel like this is perhaps one of the more valuable tools that we have access to that we don't really leverage as much as we should which is when things are really hard you need to zoom out and see it as one element within your whole lifespan and that there's more to come you know i mean people commit suicide because they can't see beyond the time domain they're in or they think it's gonna go on forever when we're happy we we rarely think this is gonna last forever but which is an interesting contrast in its own right but i think that psychedelics while i have very little experience with them i i have some and and it sounds like they're just a very interesting window into the the different apertures well how to surf that wave is probably a skill one of the things i was prepared for and i think it's important is not to resist i think i understand what it means to resist the thing a powerful wave and it's not going to be good so you have to be able to surface so i was ready for that to relax through it and maybe because i'm quite good at that from knowing how to relax in all kinds of disciplines playing piano and guitar when i was super young and then through jiu jitsu knowing the value of relaxation and through all kinds of sports should be able to relax the body fully and just accept whatever happens to you that process is probably why it was a very positive experience for me did you have any interest in iboga i'm very interested in ibogaine iboga there's a colleague of mine and researcher at stanford nolan williams who's been doing some transcranial magnetic stimulation and brain imaging on people who have taken the ibogaine ibogaine as i understand it gives a twenty two hour psychedelic journey where no hallucinations with eyes open but you close your eyes and you get a a very high resolution image of actual events that happened in your life but then you have agency within those movies i think you have to be of healthy heart to be able to do it i think you have to be on a heart rate monitor it's not trivial it's not like these other psychedelics but there's a wonderful group called veterans solutions that has used iboga combined with some other psychedelics in the veterans community to to great success for things like ptsd and it's a group i've i've really tried to support in in any way that i can mainly by being vocal about the great work they're doing but you hear incredible stories of people who are just like like near cratered in their life or zombied by ptsd and other things post war get back a lightness or achieve a lightness and a clarity that they didn't feel they had so i'm very curious about these compounds the state of kentucky we should check this but i believe has taken money from the opioid crisis settlement for ibogaine research i mean so this is like no longer yes if you look here let's see did they do it oh no no oh no they backed away kentucky backs away from the plan to fund opioid treatment research for several use the money to treat opioid now officials are backing off fifty billion what is on its way over the coming years fifty billion dollars fifty billion dollars is on its way to state and local government over the coming years the pool of funding comes from multiple legal statements with pharmaceutical companies that profited from manufacturing or selling opioid painkillers kentucky has some of the highest number of deaths from the opioid so they were going to do psychedelic research with ibogaine supporting research on illegal illegal folks psychedelic drug called ibogaine well i guess they backed away from it well sooner or later we'll get some happy news up on the on the internet during this episode i don't know what to talk about the the the the shark and the crocodile fighting yeah yeah that's true that's true and you survived the jungle well that's the the thing i was i was i was writing to you on whatsapp multiple times because i was gonna put on the internet are you okay and if you're like alive and then i was gonna just like put it to twitter just like he's alive but then of course you're far too classy for that so you just came back alive well jungle or not one one of the lessons is also you know when when you hear the call for adventure just fucking do it i was gonna ask you it's kinda silly question but like give me a small fraction of things on your bucket list bucket list yeah go to mars yeah what's what's the status of that i don't know i'm being patient about the whole thing red planet ran that cartoon of you guys going to mars that one's pretty funny that's true actually that one's pretty funny one where goggins is already up there yeah that's a good that's a funny one probably also true i would love i would love to die on mars cool but i i just love humanity reaching onto the stars and doing this a bold adventure and and taking big risks and exploring i love exploration what about seeing different animal species i i'm a huge fan of this guy joel sartore where he he has this photo arc project where he takes portraits of all these different animals if people aren't already following him on instagram he's doing some really important work this guy's instagram is amazing like portraits of him well look at it look at these portraits the amount of i don't wanna say personality because we don't wanna project anything onto them but yeah the the like the eyes and he'll occasionally put them moving on there's a little owl i delight in things like this i've got some content coming on animals and animal neuroscience and eyes oh and dogs or all kinds all animals and i'm very interested in kids' content that that incorporates animals we have some things brewing there like i i could look at this kind of stuff all day long look at that bat like bats people think about bats as kinda like little flickering little annoying disease carrying things but look how beautiful that little sucker is how's your podcast with the cookie monster coming oh yeah we've been in discussions with cookie the it's can't say too much about that but cookie monster embodies dopamine right cookie monster wants cookie right wants cookie right now you know like it was that it was that one tweet cookie monster i bounce because cookies come from all directions you know it's like it's just embodying the the the desire for for something and and which is an incredible aspect of ourselves the other one is you you remember a little while ago elmo put out a tweet hey how's everyone doing out there and it went viral and you know the surgeon general of the united states have been talking about the loneliness crisis he came on the podcast and you know a lot of people have been talking about problems with loneliness mental health issues with loneliness elmo puts out a tweet hey how's everyone doing out there and everyone gravitates toward it you know so the the different sesame street characters really embody the different like kind of aspects of self through very like narrow neural circuit perspective you know snuffleupagus is shy and oscar the grouch is grouchy right and the count one two the archetypes of yeah the archetypes of very jungian once again yeah and i think that you know the creators of sesame street clearly either understand that or it's an unconscious genius to that so yeah there there are some things brewing on on conversations with sesame street characters it's not i know you'd like to talk to vladimir putin i'd like to talk to cookie monster it illustrates the differences in our like sophistication or something well that's illustrates a lot those are yeah illustrates a lot bucket list but yeah i also i love animation so i'm not anime that's not my thing but animation so i'm very interested in the use of animation to get science content across so there are a bunch of things brewing but but anyway i delight in sartorius' work and and and it is there's a conservation aspect to it as well but i think that mostly we wanna thank you for finally putting up something that like where something's not being killed or like let some sad sad outcome these are all really positive they're really cool they're really cool and every once in a while i'll look at look at that mountain lion but i also like to look at these and and some of them remind me of certain people right so let let's just scroll through like for instance i think when we don't try and process it too much so like like okay look at this cat this civet cat amazing like i feel like that's somebody i feel like this is like a like someone i met once as a young curiosity and curiosity and a playfulness carnivore carnivore frontalized eyes found in forested areas perception right so then you go down you know it's like this beautiful fish neon pink right sure because it reminds you of some of the like the influencers you see on instagram mhmm right except this one's natural just kidding let's see no filter no filter yeah let's see if we like i feel like bears i'm a big fan of bears yeah bears are beautiful this one kinda reminds me of you a little bit there's like a stoic nature to it a curiosity so you can kinda feel like the essence of animals you you don't even have to do psychedelics to get there oh look at that he's like the behind the scenes of how it's actually yeah and then there's wow yeah yeah the in the jungle the diversity of life was also stark yeah from a scientific perspective just the the fact that most of those species are not identified was fascinating right it was like a little every little every little insect is a kind of discovery right i mean one of the reasons i love new york city so much despite its problems at times is that everywhere you look there's life it's like a tropical reef if you've ever done scuba diving or snorkeling you look on a tropical reef and it's like there's some little crab working on something and like everywhere you look there's life you you know in the bay area if you go scuba diving or snorkeling it's like a kelp bed you know the bay area is like a kelp bed every once in a while some big fish goes by it's like a big ipo but like most of the time not a whole lot happens actually the bay area it's interesting as i've been going back there more and more recently there are really cool little subcultures starting to pop up again nice there's incredible skateboarding the g x one thousand guys are these guys that that bomb down hills they're nuts like they're just going like that so just speed not tricks you gotta see g x one thousand these guys going down hills in san francisco they are wild and occasionally unfortunately and occasionally someone will get hit by a car but he g x one thousand look into intersections they have spotters you can see someone there oh i see there's a like but into traffic yeah into traffic so in san francisco yeah this is crazy like this is unbelievable and and they're they're just wild but in any case what's on your bucket list that you haven't done well i'm working on a book so i'm actually going to head to a cabin for a couple weeks and write which i've never done mhmm people talk about doing this but i'm gonna do that that's i'm excited for that just the mental space of really dropping into writing like jack nicholson in the shining category let's hope not okay let's hope not you know before i mean i only started doing public facing anything for posting on instagram in twenty nineteen but i used to head up to wallala on the northern coast of california sometimes by myself to a little cabin there and spend a weekend by myself and just read and write papers and things like that i used to do that all the time i i i miss that so some of that i'm trying to spend a bit more time with my relatives in argentina relatives in the on the east coast see my parents more they're in good health thankfully i wanna get married and have a family that's an important priority i've been putting a lot of lot of work in there yeah it's a big one yeah that's a big one yeah putting a lot of work into the the the runway on that what's your advice for people about that or give advice to yourself about how to find love in this world how to find how to build a family get there and and then i'll listen to it someday and see if i hit the marks yep but well obviously pick the right partner but also like do the work on yourself know know yourself the the the oracle know thyself and i think listen i have a friend he's a new friend but he's a friend who i met for a meal he's a very very well known actor overseas and his stuff has made it over here and we become friends and we went to lunch and we were talking about work and being public facing and all this kind of thing and and then i said do you have kids right and he says he has four kids i was like oh yeah you know i see your post with the kids you seem really happy and he said he just looked at me leaned in and he said it's the best gift you'll ever give yourself and he also said and pick your partner the mother of your kids very carefully so you know that's good advice coming from excellent advice coming from somebody who's you know very successful in work and family so that's the only thing i can pass along we hear this from friends of ours as well but kids are amazing and family's amazing and you know that's the different people all these people wanna like be immortal and then live to be two hundred or something you know there's also the the old fashioned way of you know having children that live on and evolve a new legacy but they have you know half your dna so that's exciting yeah i think you make an amazing dad thank you it seems like a fun thing and you know i've also gotten advice from friends who are super high performing and have a lot of kids they'll say just don't overthink it right start having kids let's go right well the chaos of kids is kind of the the like it can either bury you or it can or it can give you energy but i grew up in a big pack of boys always doing like wild and crazy things and so that kind of energy is great and and if it's not a big pack of wild boys it's you know and you have daughters and they can be you know different form of chaos sometimes same form of chaos how many kids do you think you want you know it's either two or five yeah very different dynamics you're one of two right you have a brother yeah i mean i'm very close with my sister i couldn't imagine having another sibling because it there's so much richness there we we talk almost every day or you know three four times a week you know sometimes just briefly but we're we're tight you know we're really look out for one another she's amazing person like truly an amazing person and has like raised her daughter in amazing way she's like you know my niece is like gonna head to college in a year or two and like my sister's done an amazing job and her dad's done a a great job too they they both really put a lot into the family aspect had a chance to spend time with a really amazing person in in peru in the amazon jungle and he is one of twenty kids wow so he's got it's mostly guys so it's just a lot of brothers and i think two sisters wow i just had jonathan haidt on the podcast the guy who's talking about anxious generation causing in the american mind he's great but he was saying that you know in order to keep kids healthy they need to not be on social media or have smartphones until they're sixteen i've actually been thinking a lot about getting a bunch of friends onto neighboring properties you know everyone talks about this mhmm not creating a commune or anything like that but i think he i think jonathan's right we we were more or less our brain wiring does best when we raised in small village type environments where kids can forage the whole free range kids idea and i grew up skateboarding and building forts and dirt clod wars and all that stuff it would be so strange to have a childhood without that yeah and i think more and more as we wake up to the negative aspects of digital interaction we'll put more and more value to in person interaction so i mean it's cool to see for instance kids in new york city they're just kinda moving around the city with so much sense of agency it's really really cool the suburbs like where i grew up like as soon as we could get out take the seven f bus up to san francisco and hang out with you know wild ones like that you know while there were dangers i mean we couldn't wait to get out of the suburbs the moment that you know forts and dirt clod wars and stuff didn't didn't cut it we just like wanted into the city so i bucket list i will probably move to a major city not los angeles or san francisco in the next few years new york city potentially those are all such different flavors of experiences yeah so i'd i'd love to live in new york city for a while i've always wanted to do that and i and i will do that i've always wanted to also have a place in a very rural so area so colorado montana are are high on my list right now and to be able to pivot back and forth between the two would be great just for such different experiences i and also i like a very physical life so the idea of getting up in the sun with the sun in the montana or colorado type environment and and i've been doing some putting some effort towards finding a spot for that and new york city to me i know it's got its issues and people say oh it wasn't what it was okay i get it but listen i've never lived there so for me it'd be entirely new and you know schulz seems full of life there is an energy to that city and he represents that i mean there's yeah and and the full diversity of weird that is represented in new york city is great yeah you walk down the street there's like a person with like a cat on their head and no one gives a shit you know that's great right san francisco used to be like that the joke was like you have to be naked and on fire in san francisco before someone sees it but now it's changed but again recently i've noticed that san francisco it's not just about the skateboarders it's there's some community houses of people in tech that are super interesting there's some community housing of people not in tech that i've learned about and been known people who've lived there and and it's it's cool like there's stuff happening in these cities that's new and different i mean that's what youth is for they're supposed to evolve evolve things out so amidst all that you still have to get shit done i've been really obsessed with tracking time recently like making sure i have daily activities i have habits that i'm maintaining and i'm very religious about making sure i get shit done do you use an app or something like that no just google sheets so basically a spreadsheet that i'm tracking daily and i write scripts that that whenever i i achieve a goal it glows green yeah do you track your workouts and all that kind of stuff too no the just the fact that i got the workout done yeah so i just it's a check mark thing so i i'm really really big on making sure i do a thing it doesn't matter how long it is so i have a rule for myself that i do a set of tasks for at least five minutes every day and it turns out that many of them i do way longer but just even just doing it i have to do it every day and there's currently eleven of them and it's just a thing like one of them is playing guitar for example so do you do that kind of stuff do you do like daily habits yeah i do my i wake up if i don't feel i slept enough i do this non sleep deep rest yoga nidra thing that i talked about a bunch we actually released a few of those tracks as audio tracks on spotify ten minute twenty minute ones puts me back into a state that feels like sleep and then i feel very rested actually matt walker and i are gonna run a study he just submitted the irb to to run a study on nsdr and what it's actually doing to the brain there's some evidence of increases in dopamine etcetera but those are older studies still cool studies but so i'll do that get up hydrate and if i've got my act together i punch some caffeine down like some matina some coffee maybe another matina and resistance train three days a week run three days a week okay and then take one day off and like to be done by eight thirty nine and then i wanna get into some real work i actually have a sticky note on my computer it's like just like reminding me how good it feels to accomplish some real work and then i go into it right now it's the book writing researching a podcast and and just fight tooth and nail to stay off social media text message whatsapp youtube all that get something done how long can you go can you go like three hours just deep focus if i hit a groove yeah ninety minutes to three hours if i'm really in a groove that's tough for me i start the day actually that's why i'm afraid i'd really prize that those morning hours i start with the work yeah and it's it's it's i'm trying to hit the four hour mark of deep focus great i love it then it often can't important yeah important i'm really really big believer yeah it's it's often torture actually it's really really difficult oh yeah the agitation but i've i've sat across the table from you a couple years ago when i was out here in austin doing some work and i was working on stuff you were gonna and i noticed you just like stare at your notebook sometimes just like pen at the same position and then you'll get back into it like they're those oh building that hydraulic pressure and then go yeah i try and get something done of value then it the communications start and talking to my podcast producer my team is everything i mean like the the magic potion in the podcast is rob moore right who's in the has been in the room with me every single solo costello used to be in there with us but that's it people have asked journalists have asked can they sit in friends have asked nope just rob and for guest interviews he's there as well and i talk to rob all the time all the time we talk multiple times per day and you know in life i've i've made some errors in certain relationship domains in my life in terms of partner choice and things like that and certainly don't blame all of it on them but you know i've played my role but but in terms of picking business partners and friends like you know to work with i mean rob's just it's been bull's eyes and it's just rob has been amazing mike blabach our photographer and the guys i mentioned earlier like we just communicate as much as we need to and we pour over every decision like near neuroticism before we make we put anything out there and so including like even creative decisions of like topics to cover all that yeah like a like a photo for the book jacket the other day mike shoots photos then and then we look at them we pour over them together logo for the perform podcast with andy galpin that we're launching like is that the right contour mike's the real he's got the aesthetic thing because he was at dc so long as a portrait photographer and he's cute he was close friends with ken block the gymkhana like all the car jumping in the city stuff like i mean mike is a mass he's a he's a true master of that stuff and and we just pour over every little decision but even with sponsors you know there are dozens of ads now by the way the that whole jawser sizer thing of me saying oh you a guy went from a two to a seven i never said that that's ai like i would never call number off somebody a two to a seven are you kidding me it's crazy so is ai if you bought the thing i'm sorry but like our sponsors we list the sponsors that we have and why on our website and like the decision do we work with this person or not do we still like the product i mean we've we've got ways with sponsors because of like changes in the product or you know most time it's amicable all good but you know like just every detail and that just takes a ton of time and energy but i try and work mostly on content and my team's constantly trying to keep me out of the other discussions mhmm but i because i obsess but yeah you you have to you have to have a team of some sort someone that you can run things by for sure but one of the challenges the larger the team is and i i'd like to be involved in a a lot of different kinds of stuff including engineering stuff robotics work research all of those interactions at least for me take away from the deep work the the deep focus right unfortunately i get drained by social interaction even with the people i love and really respect and all that kind of stuff you're an introvert yeah like fundamentally an introvert so to me it's a trade off getting shit done versus collaborating and i have to choose wisely because without collaboration without a great team which i'm fortunate enough to be a part of like you wouldn't get anything really done but as an individual contributor to get stuff done like to do the hard work of researching or programming all that kind of stuff you need the hours of deep work i used to spend a lot more time alone that's that's on my bucket list spend a bit more time dropped into work alone it i think social media like causes our brain to go the other direction i try and answer some comments and then and then get back to work i'm really after go to the jungle i appreciate not using the device i play with the idea of like spending certainly maybe like one week a month not using social media at all mhmm i used it so after that morning block i'll eat some lunch and i'll usually do something while i'm doing lunch or something and then a bit more work and that real work deep work and then around two thirty i do a non sleep depressed take a short nap wake up boom maybe a little more caffeine and then lean into it again and then you know if you i find if you've really put in the deep work two or three bouts per day by about five or six pm it's over i was down at jocko's place not that long ago and in the evening did a sauna session with him and some family members of his and some of their friends and it's really cool like they all work all day and train all day and then in the evening they get together and they they sauna and cold plunge i'm i'm really into this whole thing of of gathering with other people at a specific time of day i have a gym in my house and i i you know tim will come over and train or you know that we've kind of slowed that down in recent months but i think gathering in groups once a day being alone for part of the day i mean it's like very fundamental stuff we're not saying anything that hasn't been said millions of times before but how often do people actually do that and and and call the party you know like be the person to like bring people together if it's not happening that's something i've really had to learn even though i'm an introvert like hey i'm like gather people together you came through town the the other day and there's a lot of people at the house it was rad actually it was funny because i was getting a massage when you walked in mhmm i don't sit around getting massages very often but i was getting one that day and then everyone came in and the dog came in and like everyone was piled in it was it was very sweet again no devices but choose wisely the people you gather with right right and i was close thank you for clarifying i wasn't which is very weird yeah yeah the the the friends you surround yourself with that that's another thing it's like i understood that from ayahuasca and from just the experience in the jungle is like just select the people just be careful how you allocate your time i just saw on somewhere conor mcgregor has this good line i wrote it down about loyalty he said don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with oh that guy is i mean he's big on loyalty all the shit talk all of that set that aside to me like loyalty is really big because then if you invest in certain people in your life and they stick by you and you stick by them and mhmm what the what else is life about yeah well hardship will show you who your real friends are that's for sure and you know we're fortunate to have a lot of them it'll also show you who you know who really like has put in the time to try and understand you and and understand people like people are complicated i love that so can you read the quote once more don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with yeah so in in that way a hardship is a gift it shows you definitely and it makes you stronger it definitely makes you stronger let's go get some food yeah you're a one meal a day guy yeah i actually ate something earlier but it was like a protein shake and a couple pieces of biltong i hope we're eating a steak i hope so too i'm full of nicotine and caffeine yeah what do you think how do you feel i feel good yeah i was i was thinking you'd probably like i only did a half a piece and i won't have more for for a little while but a little too good yeah thank you for talking once again brother yeah thanks so
