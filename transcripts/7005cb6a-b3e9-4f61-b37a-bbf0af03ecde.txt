the following is a conversation with alexandra and andrea botez they're sisters professional chess players commentators educators entertainers and streamers their channel is called botez live on twitch and youtube i highly recommend you check it out a small side note about the currently ongoing controversy in the chess world where the nineteen year old grand master hans nieman beat magnus carlsen at the sinkfield cup after this magnus for the first time ever withdrew from the tournament implying with a tweet that there may have been cheating or at least something shady going on folks like the grand master hikaru nakamura fan the flames of cheating accusations and the internet made a bunch of proposals on how the cheating could have been done and arranged from the ridiculous to the hilarious often both hans himself came out and said that he has cheated before when he was twelve and sixteen on random online games to jack up his rating but he said that he has never cheated in person over the board danny wrench from chess dot com who i've spoken with may make a statement in response to hans' claims soon folks like grandmaster jakobuga spoke to his experience training hans niemann and has said that his memory and intuition were quite brilliant so as you see there's a lot of perspectives on this chessbase has a good summary of the saga that i'll link in the description also note that this is so quickly moving that new stuff might come out between me recording this and publishing the episode but i thought i'd mention this anyway since the episode with the both test sisters is a conversation about chess and was recorded shortly before the controversy so we didn't talk about it i'm considering having hans on this podcast and also magnus back on the podcast and maybe others like hikaru or folks from chess dot com's anti cheat staff to discuss their really interesting cheating detection algorithms but i may also just stay out of it i find chess to be a beautiful game and the chess community full of fascinating brilliant people and so i'll keep having conversations like these about chess it's fun my goal with this podcast and in general as a human being is to increase the amount of love in the world sometimes that involves celebrating brilliance and beauty in science in art in chess sometimes it involves empathetic conversations with controversial figures that seek to understand not deride sometimes it involves standing against the internet lynch mob as the chess based article calls it to hear the story of a human being who's under attack even if it means i get attacked in the process as well and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this podcast we've

faster i think they also sponsor a few really amazing people in the machine learning community i think i might be wrong on this but i think they sponsor the two two minute papers channel on youtube which if you don't know about i highly recommend also machine learning street talk i think they sponsor if they don't they should whether they sponsor them or not it doesn't matter they're amazing and weights and bias is amazing for that exact reason they they really support the community the reason i love them the reason the community loves them is that they create amazing tools for the task of machine learning so you can debug compare reproduce models and architectures hyperparameters you can do version control on all aspects of that including the weights of the model you're looking at the gpu usage compute usage you can do datasets and predictions and collaborate with teammates on all aspects of that so it's your own personal place for all things machine learning but more importantly it's for collaboration and team approach to collaborative research and development in the machine learning space and they don't just support the machine learning research community spiritually they

sponsor is bioptimizers that have a new magnesium supplement when i fast or i'm doing keto or carnivore all the electrolytes sodium potassium magnesium are essential and magnesium is at least to me the tricky one to get right especially when i'm doing long fasts that was the one that if i don't get right i feel kinda shitty so i like it when supplements make it easy to make sure you don't screw things up their magnesium breakthrough supplement contains seven different forms of magnesium i listen to my body and i study what diets work what don't in terms of physical performance mental performance all that kind of stuff i think that's really important to learn because we all are different in very interesting ways when you fast or you're doing keto i think some people can have a

excited about in the application of machine learning in the twenty first century is that we would be collecting data from our body and mind and using that data in combination with machine learning algorithms to give recommendations for how we should live life now if that concerns you in terms of privacy questions and so on it should and you should hold anyone that has any access to your data highly responsible in terms of respecting your privacy and i think that's one of the things we'll do in the twenty first century is promote and only give our money to companies that respect your privacy and give you control over your data but that data does hold the key to better understanding yourself especially when you're talking about biological data and insidetracker is at the cutting edge of doing just that so i'm really excited about just the very idea of it and of course their implementation of it i get special savings for a limited time when you go to inside tracker dot com

friends here's alexandra and andrea botez you just got back from italy what's the most memorable thing i was just there recently as well it was very chaotic because we went out on a whim and we only had our first hotel booked and then we rented a car and drove around all of the cities and went to like five different cities in about a week and a bit so i think it was just the variety of seeing so many different places when we're used to being at home all the time and andrea is yours your luggage yeah i would say it was the most stressful vacation we've been in in our life and it was a valuable learning lesson because now i know how to be prepared for trips but we lost our bags and i never got them back and like alex said we didn't know where we'd be sleeping every night and we're just driving through a new city with a giant van in the most narrowest streets with and getting in many many fights with italian men so it wasn't really a vacation saw this motion so many times wasn't it liberating to lose your baggage is that like still aligning it it was liberating my entire life i've always had the issue of over packing and i told her before the trip andrea you're gonna pack light right yeah alex yeah and then i see her stuffing her overweight suitcase we both had giant big like extra baggage that we didn't need and i'm actually very glad we lost it because for venice hauling that around on all the boats and through the tiny streets and there's no ubers and now it's the first time where i can travel without checking in a bag which i've never done before so now i've learned what it means to pack light because i saw that i could survive off of just my this sounds very dramatic but it was really a big learning lesson for me the driving must have been crazy because driving in italy is is rough the driving was crazy i did most of it and it would be really interesting driving through places like florence or even through the beach areas that were super windy because there are two way streets that should really only be one way so you'd be driving this huge van and then another car comes on a cliff and you're just waiting for it to slowly pass so it took all of my focus and concentration to drive well in italy but it was actually really relaxing because the hardest thing about making a lot of videos online is you're always thinking about it what's coming next and when we were in italy it was so chaotic that i did not think about work for a good week and a bit oh because you're just we were stressed i was just trying to keep us alive it seemed higher priority and that was kinda fun it was kinda fun no planning nothing i wouldn't recommend it or ever do that again but it sounds it sounds pretty awesome and we even randomly ran into two friends of ours who were in the same city and we just traveled with them for about half of the trip yeah so you just took on the chaos exactly it was an adventure okay and i see like because you were using your hands a lot you gotten you you picked up some of the the the italian hand gestures i did we did get yelled at by a lot of italians the old italian grandmas would come to us after breakfast because we'd leave something on the plate and she'd be like you could feed an entire village with that tell your friends and we'd be we'd feel so yeah we got cursed out a lot but it really remind me of where we grew up and helped that's true yeah bring back those where'd you grow up oh we were we're romanian but it was like an immigrant neighborhood in canada so you know same if you don't finish your plate that's disrespectful to the people who made the food how's the food in italy i feel like the carbs thing is too intense very yeah i think very overrated in my opinion so i'm actually not supposed to eat gluten because i have an allergy yeah but i was in italy and it's you know gluten galore chaos so i was actually eating a lot of it and it was very interesting because i didn't get sick while i was in italy but i do while i'm in the us so yeah somehow the food was actually maybe more okay for me to digest which i appreciated but i didn't like it as much as i thought did you like the food there yeah no i think it's it's i did i did i love cars but it's it's it feels like vegas when i when i go there for the food mhmm it's like if i stay here too long i'm gonna do things i regret that's what it feels like with the food right because i don't know how to moderate and everybody is pushing very large portions in wild kinda eating things on you pasta pizza and it's so and bread yeah so delicious so yeah i i love it but i regret everything so it's like i don't wanna i i don't wanna go to a place where i'm going to regret everything i do that's pretty predictable for too long of a time yeah surprisingly the people there though are still very fit and everyone stays in good shape but that's probably because you're walking around all day and you're much more active than anything and they also just know how to moderate food i i think i've gotten used to the us way of eating the us portion is that just a lot never always a lot yeah yeah and more and i feel in the us food advertisements are also much more in your face and you're more often reminded of junk food than we were in italy so even though we were eating less healthy things i think we were getting cravings and being pushed towards junk food less often alright i gotta ask you a hard question so the romance languages so i think french is up there as like number one number one in terms of i don't know this this is ranking them oh you guys speak italian or no not italian but we studied french and spanish in school romanian which is and romanian i feel like every country calls their language a romance language but it's romanian french spanish portuguese and i think there was one more that was like this dialect but those are considered the romance languages okay so where would you put italian i think we got yelled at so much from italian that is not gonna be a threat okay so it doesn't work it's very it's on the bottom of the list because people did not use it nicely to us but i always really liked how french sounds i i think something about it where maybe spanish actually sounds nicer to the ears but french has more character and it feels more sultry so i like french what about you that was my answer too oh sultry okay yeah i feel like french well in france i feel like i'm always being judged like they're better than me that's what french they are better than us that's so true this is so true which is why you know i yeah i long to belong to that i like the british accent the british accent yeah actually one thing we did on our italian trip is we just picked up british accents for the entire trip for fun and we forgot we were doing them to the point where we talked to british people and they'd ask us why are you talking like that it's gonna stop i i did feel feel much more elegant and mature that's true people like you know i don't know if they felt the same way about us but it was more of you know the confidence you do feel like you're more poised for sure yeah so how'd you guys get into chess when when did you first let's say when did you first fall in love with chess so we both started playing when we were pretty young around six years old that's when our dad taught us and i enjoyed playing chess because i had good results early on but a lot of it was being pushed from my dad to play chess and i only really started loving it when we moved from canada and we started moving a lot and chess was the one stable thing that i had and it was also where all of my friends were so it was kind of that foundational thing for me and that's when i started studying chess very intensely and when i started putting in the hours out of my own will and not because i was being pushed by my dad that's when i started really loving it and i even wanted to take time off college to just focus on chess so training and competing training and competing yeah it was when i was doing it for myself that i started getting my best results and actually enjoying the thing and really enjoying it yeah i would spend summer vacation studying for tournaments and my mom would come and say you need to make friends go leave the house and i'd be like no i need to play chess and i i remember those moments that you rebelled by playing chess that's all exactly how did you get into it yeah my my experience with loving in high school is very opposite from alex's but right my sister was playing and my dad taught me when i was older than six cool in high school unlike me you are i i wouldn't say cool i'd say more balance and i was interested in other hobbies in my childhood if i ever really did love chess there's certainly moments about like traveling and being together with my family and spending those moments together but those are more the social and the experiences but funny enough like i think my happiest moment where i really played the game for my own enjoyment was probably my most recent tournament because this was after obviously we've been streaming and i'm no longer in high school but when i was in school i was always playing for college and for the results trying to build a resume so i was too stressed out about the pressure to really enjoy the game whereas when i just played my first tournament so it was like a after like a two year break because of the pandemic and it was also all live on twitch so there was some pressure but it was the first time that like i was really eager to study for the game sitting and focusing since we've been streaming and not getting distracted by something else in years like i said and the tournament experience i hit my highest rating and it was my best tournament ever and i think most of that is because it came from my own enjoyment so you you didn't enjoy the the domination because i think you like did really well right in this was like a couple months ago oh yeah yeah the tournament well of course the i think the results came from enjoying the tournament yeah because i would be in high school like studying double triple the amount of time like six hours every day compared to this tournament i didn't even prepare for it and for three years i wouldn't be able to pass one rating whereas in this one tournament i passed it by like seventy points without even any preparation so it was i think as soon as you stop worrying about the competition is when the games get much better what does it mean to pass a rating so i was stuck at nineteen hundred nineteen hundred is a hundred points off of expert yeah usually when you reach two thousand you're considered an expert which is the rating andrea was going for okay expert that's a good technical term or this like a it's more of a colloquial term where if somebody's around a two thousand and you're playing them in a tournament they won't have the actual title next to their name but you say i'm playing an expert what about like the the more official things like master does that have to do with the rating or something else so national master in the us is when you're twenty two hundred okay and what's international master international master is based off of a different system the fide system which is international to be an international master it's twenty four hundred and you have to have three international master norms yeah i think magnus said he's twenty eight six something that was yeah and then he said that's pretty decent now well he always talks about that i think what he meant is that's a decent rating because it accurately captures his actual level mhmm so it's it's not overinflated or underinflated and so on and so the discussion there was how do you get to can a human being get to twenty nine hundred mhmm and then he says because my current rate rating is pretty decent mhmm at representing my skill level it's gonna be a long road to actually get there right because it's like so you have to beat people your same level that's how the number increases exactly yeah and you beat a bunch of people in the tournament right that that are higher than you're lucky lucky oh i was playing i was really nervous because my category was like two hundred points above my rating and of course i was very rusty and i hadn't played a tournament in a while but it went pretty well do you feel the pressure when you're actually recording it like the streaming it was definitely so before every round i was vlogging and i was doing meet and greets and doing other things for the live saw you do a a meet and greet you didn't know what the hell you're doing it's great yeah like where am i how do i do this yeah i i see what what do i do it was actually really wholesome the beginning was very silly because i was just not expecting that it was gonna be more of a seminar i thought it was like oh you pose and take pictures but they actually ask really nice meaningful questions but unfortunately it's bad for youtube retention and we cut them all out so bad for you to yeah the good long form conversation yeah so it was like questions q and a type of thing exactly you have to have very fast paced for youtube and that seminar was not fast paced okay well not everything in life needs to be on youtube right that's true there's like two parallel things stuff that's fun for youtube yes and one day we'll post that q and a on that yeah when you guys like when you become like ultra famous you're currently just regular famous and then we'll appreciate the little slow content yes and that the youtube aspect the creation aspect does that add to the fun ultimately of chess of like your love of chess oh for the love of chess in general or just for competing in that one tournament no love of chess in general i i i think you said that for competing for that tournament was adding pressure yeah but actually i would say like a good pressure but yeah this is where i differed to alex because when i was just competitive and i was younger i don't think i love chess as much as when i started doing it for content because unlike her who a lot of her friends and social circle were other chess players i never really traveled and built really solid friendships through chess until i started streaming and meeting other chess streamers and actually playing and talking to people for fun rather than just always being alone in the game and never really meeting other people my age or people with similar interests so i would say twitch was the thing that really changed how i approached the game i think with with some youtubers there's a pressure to be almost somebody else you create a persona and you're stuck in that persona i think i'm too i'm too much of a boomer to know what hell twitch is anyway but the it feels like when you're actually live streaming you can't help but be who you really are i think it's oh well i think when you're live streaming and i've talked to a lot of other streamers about this you kind of just over exaggerate one side of your personality and of course it's kind of like being like on all the time like you're trying to be more entertaining and sometimes you're being sillier at moments or more you take what character traits like people know you for and for me one is being like adhd and the younger sibling who's very energetic and causes trouble even though sometimes they're cause trouble just for the camera yeah right i think yeah i think and of course once you're live streaming for like four or five hours there's gonna be moments in the stream where it's more chill but especially when you're like editing that content or you're doing bigger streams that are shorter you are kind of playing up a side of yourself because of course there's a lot of parts of me that i don't show to the camera because they're not as entertaining to watch yeah like the more serious part and also there's things that you are really interested in about what you do like i love competitive chess where i could sit and really think about it but i know that that is not gonna be as entertaining for stream i know that's not gonna be as entertaining for youtube so you kind of have to take what you like but then really adapt it for whatever the format is and sometimes that feels inauthentic but other times it just feels like repackaging what you love for people in a more general audience to enjoy do you feel like it's a trap a little bit as you evolve like i think social media is oh sorry go ahead social media in general is a trap of that of that kind well so we've been trying to switch to learn how to make youtube videos recently and so much of learning youtube school is kind of the beastification of content where you try to get to the point of the video within like the first ten seconds to not lose people you try to --ificate you mean like mister beast yeah okay yeah where it's so fast paced there's a reason to wait there's high stakes yeah and everything is created to keep people watching the video and keep people on the platform and in some ways it is a trap because it's harder to do the kind of content you like because you really have to squeeze it to be like okay well do we have a good thumbnail for this do we have a good title for this and that's something that we're trying to figure out how to keep true to what we wanna do yeah see the way i think about it is yeah there's a lot of stuff you can create and yeah the mister beastification process but also i think about what are the videos conversations or things i will create in this life that will be the best thing i do mhmm and i try not to do things in my life that will prevent me from getting there i feel like if you're always focusing on doing kind of the optimizing the thumbnail in the ten seconds and so on you'll never do the thing that's truly you're known for and remembered for so finding that balance is tricky i get that but at the same time this might be my own copium which i know is a word you know now yeah i'm slowly learning the full complexity of the term yes but the other way i think about it is it is a skill to learn how to communicate with large audiences yeah and first i started streaming chess which is something i just did and really loved but now i have to learn how to translate that format and if that's a skill set we could build then we could use it to do really important things and i've seen a lot of youtubers who have done interviews about how you know they didn't love the kind of content they did at at at first but what they're doing right now is really meaningful so i like to think of it maybe like skill development because not everybody hits off podcasts where they can talk to super interesting people right off the bat yeah you could be slow and boring in a podcast you don't have to worry about the first ten seconds i mean people like keep pushing me for because but the first ten seconds of the videos yes i do is well i know it's most important for youtube but i don't give a damn i i wrote a chrome extension that hides all the views and likes oh okay the the the click i don't look at twitch views andrea does so we i also can relate i love numbers too but that's why i don't look at it because you become like oh i you'll start to think that a conversation or a thing you did sucks because it doesn't get views yep but that's just not the case the youtube algorithm is this monster that figures stuff out yeah and if you let it control your mind i feel like it's gonna destroy you creatively so you have to find a nice balance i have to say i was laughing a little bit when i was listening to the magnus episode in the first ten minutes you guys are talking about soccer football two robots seem human in the conversation i was like let's have some fun a conversation about non chess related topics yeah talk about sports yeah it was kind of hilarious i i was surprised that even at his level i wasn't sure but i was surprised how much he loves chess it sounds cliche to say but like the way he looked at a chessboard you know those memes like i i wish somebody looked at me the way the way he still like the way he glanced down he and he reached for the pieces of excitement to show me something there was there wasn't like okay i'll show you it was like like there was still that fire that that's something that always shocks me about some of like super grandmasters like one of my coaches was a person who also his name's jiam hammer of norway he also coached magnus he was his second and he was helping me train for my tournament and i was kind of putting off doing the homework and he's like like if you're putting it off that means you're studying the wrong thing like you should be enjoying even when you're practicing which when i grew up i thought to get to the top level like practicing has to be hard and unpleasant and when i was listening to your magnus episode he was like i didn't read books very much or it was one thing that you said that's like very normal for studying classical chess that he didn't do just because it didn't interest him he says i i suck at puzzles i don't like puzzles yeah and he he doesn't do what he doesn't enjoy and that's because it's it's like purely driven out of passion i think the internet was like i suck a pussy too yeah they like the alphabet they related i don't have to study at all it's just it's fun and but i think the lesson there that's really powerful is he spends most of the day thinking about chess because he wants to yes so do whatever if if you're into getting better at chess do whatever it takes exactly to actually just the number of hours you spend a day thinking about chess maximize that if you're like super serious about it i actually get very addicted whenever i start studying chess which is why i don't do it as seriously when i'm focused on content because i go through these rabbit holes where if i'm focusing on chess i wanna be as good as i possibly can at the game otherwise it's hard for me to enjoy it because it's such a competitive thing and i remember training for tournaments and when you're training for tournaments you even start dreaming about chess and you can't stop thinking about it and it's as if you're flipped into this completely different world which is also what i like best about the game that it's a completely different living experience and then you take some drugs and now you start to see things on the ceiling is there some factual hallucination like to the queen's gambit like those scenes i think it's is that based on your life story from well we can't say that on camera no just kidding actually chess players are very careful to not take drugs they drink a lot yeah they drink so much it's actually crazy for how good they're able to play chess when they do but when it comes to things like psychedelics or other things they usually stay away from those because they don't wanna mess anything up in their brain so this is actually intervention i've i saw on that you mentioned somewhere i think it was the lie detector test where you have a drinking problem is that is that an actual i i think i think that's actually a meme that we like to joke about on stream because occasionally we'd have like a white claw on stream or something like that and then people meme about it it goes back to andrea's point of amplifying a part of your personality to make yourself a little bit right more entertaining i'm gonna use that as an excuse from now on i'm just this podcast is just amplifying a part of that person i'm not really like this but have you played drunk like magnus has has played drunk he says it helps someone with the creativity is there is there any truth to that well andrea is under twenty one so she's obviously would never do that would never do that but i have played while drinking actually i enjoy playing chess chess and drinking more than pre gaming or going out to a club and drinking which sounds really silly and i'll usually play against opponents who are also you know having some beer and it does make you feel like you're seeing the game from a fresher perspective where it can sometimes make you feel more confident liquid confidence and it does help with creativity you just feel like you could pull things off yeah but there's also a limit it's more like you've had one drink or two drink but then it goes beyond that and then you just start missing tactics and it's not worth it yeah i think it only helps players in very short time controls one time i was challenging this grand master on stream and we were playing bullet chess which is one minute chess and i was giving him handicaps and i said okay you have to take four shots before the next game and he just got like ten times stronger and transformed into like the hulk and destroyed me more than the last game so but of course if you're playing like a three hour game it's gonna get old but i think in short time controls it's amazing yeah definitely has to be blitz it has to be where it's more intuition rather than sitting in calculus because it's probably like negatively affecting your ability to calculate absolutely yeah how much when you guys play when you look at the chessboard how much of it is calculation how much of it is intuition how much of it is memorized openings it really depends between short form chess so five minutes three minutes one minute and classical chess what's your favorite to play i love playing blitz now because that's most of what i do and that's actually how i got into chess streaming because i couldn't spend entire weekends or weeks playing tournaments so i would just while i was in college log on and play these long blitz or bullet sessions and it's very fast so you don't have time to go calculate as deeply you basically have to calculate short lines pretty quickly and a lot of it is pattern recognition and intuition that's three minutes you said three minutes yeah okay cool and so for that it's just it's basically intuition a lot of it is intuition yeah see i saw on the streams you actually keep talking while playing chess it seems really difficult my result that doesn't help my results it doesn't the content of the game yeah exactly but you can still do it because i i it feels like how can you possibly concentrate while talking it's because so much of it is intuition you're not while you're talking you're thinking about that topic but then you just come to the board and you just understand what you should be doing here and then sometimes you get in trouble because you're talking and you have now lost half of your time you have a minute and a half your opponent has three and you're kind of at a disadvantage but that kinda goes to show that that's how blitz chess usually works whereas classical is very different which of you is better at chess i mean let let's do it this way can you andrea can you say what in which way is alex stronger than you which way is she weaker than you not physically in in terms of the in terms of chess well yes of course she is higher rated but when we do play i think her strengths against me where she really gets me is the endgame she has stronger endgame so she can and i actually have a stronger opening but as soon as she's i'm supposed to say what is good about you not you yeah no i'm getting there well see that's what i'm saying because don't worry it's related okay because if i can i can get an advantage in the beginning of the game but as soon as she starts trading pieces down down like my confidence drops because i know that the end game is the hardest part of the game and the longest and that's where she ends up beating me so her end game is her i think really what makes a difference and she has it sounds like her psychological warfare is better too that because if you're getting nervous that is the but it's harder to play against higher rated players same how you know magnus and former world championship champions have that psychological edge so i think it's always gonna be different for andrea because she knows statistically she should be winning something like one in four games but she usually does better than that because she's very distracting and talks a lot that does help what does it feel like to play a higher rated player what's the experience of that in in like playing somebody like magnus yeah so it depends on how much higher rated than you they are if it's someone who's like between me and andrea let's say it's a two hundred point difference you know they should win but at least you still feel like you have a chance i was playing in title tuesday which is this tournament chess dot com has every tuesday and i got really lucky beat a gm drew an international master and then i got paired against hikaru nakamura and my brain just went blank because the i just know that i'm so unlikely to win that i couldn't even play the game properly when it's that much of a difference where they should be winning like ninety nine percent of the time but that's like psychological so you're saying that's the biggest experience is like actually knowing the numbers and statistically thinking there's no way i can win but i meant like is there a suffocating feeling like positionally you feel like you're constantly under attack you just feel like you're slowly getting outsmarted and the worst is when you don't even know what you're doing wrong you come out of that and you're like i thought i was doing great and i got slowly squeezed i didn't understand what was going on and you're just kind of baffled it's kind of like watching alpha zero beat up stockfish and you don't really understand why it's making certain moves or how it thought of the plan you just see it slowly getting the position better and that's what it feels like i i would add it's it's kind of different for me if they're someone who's significantly higher rated so let's say more than like three hundred points or you're playing magnus what i notice is i just feel lost straight as soon as i don't know my preparation because they know so many opening lines that they're gonna know the best line to beat you that you haven't studied so then on move ten you're like he already has a maybe plus point five advantage which is really small but for someone with such a significant skill level you know you already lost at that point and it's like a third of the game what are the strengths and weaknesses of andrea andrea is very good at opening preparation as she said as she said she likes bringing that up i mean she's very meticulous about it where she'll really go in and learn her lines and having that initial starting confidence isn't just helpful for the opening but it helps develop your plans for the middle game so i think she's very good at that i think she's actually pretty good at tactical combinations what is tactics tactics is like solving puzzles or basically finding lines that are forced where if you find them you're going to win so that's like puzzles within a within a position yeah exactly whereas strategic chess is making slow moves and over the process of like twenty moves you get a slightly better position based on an understanding of the overall strategy so in my extensive research of you on wikipedia it says your most played opening is the king's indian defense in which quote black allows white to advance their pawns to the center of the board in the first two moves i is there any truth to this so the kings and kings probably is my most played opening and it's one where even when my coach who was a grand master taught me he's like so you know i've been playing the king's indian for ten years and i still don't understand it and it's one of those openings that computers really don't like because you do they hate it stockfish doesn't like it maybe alphazero would change their mind i forgot to look at what can you show me by the way what it is yeah is it is it white's opening or black's opening black responds to the d four queen's pawn push and you take your knight out to f six i'll just put in the you know stereotypical classical king's indian more so to say so we actually have a very famous king's indian game in the notes that we prepared okay so for hours for the record i asked you guys for one mhmm some games that you find pretty cool and well maybe to get a chance to talk about some yeah so this is the king's indian as you can see white has much more control over the center white has three pawns in the center while black has none past the fifth rank and you just have this pawn on d six and one of the ideas in chess is if you're not taking the center then your plan revolves around trying to continually challenge it but what is really fun about the king's indian is that black sometimes gets these crazy king side attacks while white gets queen side attacks and even though it's a little bit suspicious for black and the computer could usually break it it's hard to defend as a human when you're being attacked but if you don't pull off the attack as black then you're just gonna end up being lost in the end game so it's like a very asymmetrical position it's very asymmetrical although a lot of people now stop playing into the classical king's indian even though computers give it a big advantage and they play these slower lines in the king's indian which are less fun to play what's slower mean it takes a a longer time to like do something interesting with they basically don't let you get as much of a king side attack because they try opening up the center and then you have no weaknesses but you're just slowly improving the position of your pieces instead of being able to go for that king side attack so for people just listening there is a the the white pawns are all on on the fourth row in a row together that feels like a bad position for black for white oh you don't like taking the center no i like taking the center now you're talking trash around oh sorry but like they just like they're like feel vulnerable they're in a row together like it's like a like a you know because they're like who's gonna defend them i guess the knights defend them and the queen defends it the you're actually talking about a theme that you do see sometimes which is called hanging pawns and when you have two pawns right next to each other with no other pawns to defend them yeah so it it it is a value valid point and actually as black you're trying to break apart these pawns or get them to push and create some holes into the position but it's a trade off and that's a lot of what chess openings are about you get more space but you'll also end up having to protect your pawns potentially or move them forward to the point where they're overextended and plus the pawns being vulnerable is kind of fun this it's like there's more stuff in danger they're not because if it's if it's like this everything is like trapped like you can't do anything everything's blocked yeah they're blocked off yeah because you can't have fun yeah the the opening principles for white is get your pawns in the center so i'd say like this is actually preferable for white go let's go over some opening principles i there we go because this is a very good learning lesson for any chess beginners in the in the audience okay so first thing you wanna do is control the center there you go east four the more aggressive one isn't that like the the basic vanilla move i didn't somebody told me that's the most popular opening move in chess it is why is that considered aggressive so the two it's e four and d four and the king's pawn is known as being for more tactical players whereas d four is known for more positional players so that's why it's considered more aggressive tactical gambits with e four i think so tactical means i'm i'm gonna try to attack you or you're gonna try to go for puzzles and rely more on your combination abilities whereas if it's something positional you usually have like three to four moves that are all good in the position whereas tactics you need to see this one line so it's more precise so this this one is cool because they can like you know the queen can come out the bishop can come out yeah and that's one of the most popular checkmates and usually what you teach new students to try to cheese their friends because then they feel really excited that they know this new trap where you bring the bishop and the queen out and you try to checkmate on f seven yeah it's the trap that queen's gambit beth harmon falls for nerve like first game versus the janitor she gets all mad because gets checkmated very early oh that's the one she gets checkmated with yeah okay i love how you guys were actually paying attention to the games mhmm carefully which is pretty cool that they did a good job of like improving evolving her game throughout the show to actually represent an actual growth of a chess player yeah they they really took every detail into consideration which was cool okay so what what else that's so that's i brought stuff to the the same okay so then you wanna develop your pieces so in the beginning of the game you wanna take out the bishops and knights first because you don't wanna start with the most valuable piece like the queen because then it'll become a a vulnerability and it'll get attacked very early on and the reason you're taking out these two pieces first is because you wanna castle your king so you can move a knight move or a bishop move and that's considered developing yeah so if at the at this stage not like even before getting a few pawns out you usually wanna start with getting a pawn because you wanna get space in the center but also when you push pawns it helps free up some of your pieces so usually start with one pawn first and then you could start taking out your minor pieces which is the bishop in the knight i have anxiety about a pawn just floating out there defenseless but well it's not attacked yet it's a see those are what you call ghost threats so you're scared of something that hasn't happened yet so if i were to attack it feel like there's a deeper thing going on here yeah actually let's say yeah so you're attacking the pawn in the center here mhmm and it is vulnerable but as soon as you do that i can develop my own knight and defend it as well okay and for people just listening there's two pawns that just came out to meet each other and a couple of nights you love the chess coming in point yeah pawns met after midnight yeah yeah well i'm gonna romanticize the game a bit exactly okay cool so so like there's if you bring out the bishops with the knights you're matching that with the other the black is going to match it whatever you're attacking with yep he's developed defend it i could okay develop your bishop or your knight whenever you'd like oh no now you give him options alright yeah there you go now i am attacking the pawn in the center which is what you were afraid about before but let's see how you defend it here by doing this symmetrical thing bringing out the knight on the other side and actually your other move was good as well defending with the pawn because then you're freeing up space for your bishop so you're basically trying to develop your pieces as quickly as possible put your pawns in the center and then get your king to safety and that's usually the basic opening tips that you get and it is kinda counterintuitive that safety is in the corner of the board for a king it's true that was always confusing to me but you know three pawns in front though you typically don't push those maybe like one maybe it'll go one square but these are will be like the wall of defense that keep him safe but another way to also think about it is your pieces usually wanna point towards the center if you have a knight closer to the center than closer to the side it actually has more squares it can go to so a huge part of it is just wanting to have flexibility for where your pieces go so more pieces are going to be able to make threats in the center or even open up the position so since that's where it's most likely to open you want your king somewhere where the position will stay closed so that you have the pawns to defend you know there is like rules like this but i i always wonder because i've i've built chess engines but then you start to wonder like why is it that positionally these things are good like you've built up an intuition about it but i wish and that's the thing that would be amazing if engines could explain why is this kind of thing better than this kind of thing you start to build up an intuition but if i'm just like know nothing about jess it feels confusing that cornering your king like getting him like trapped here like it feels like you could get checkmated easier there right if i was just to use like dumb intuition but it seems like that's not the case i imagine maybe because alpha zero learned by playing games against itself right yeah and i imagine if you have a lot of games and you do build an intuition because if you were to keep your king in the center you just see that in those games you're dealing with threats a lot more often but yeah they're shortcut rules and this doesn't even mean it's the best way to play chess as we've seen with alpha zero kinda changing the rules of the game a little bit but as a human to learn it from scratch is a lot more difficult than to start with principles so that's why beginners usually learn chess this way yeah but we and because you're playing other humans and the other humans have also operated on the different principles and that's why people that come up now that are training with engines are just going to be much better at than the people of the past because they're gonna have they're gonna try out weirder ideas that go against the principles of old right and they're gonna do like weird stuff including sacrifices and stuff like that yeah and i also think that's why alphazero was so shocking because stockfish was using an opening database so it was already based off of knowledge that humans have from playing chess for years that we just thought is how you're supposed to play whereas alphazero just learned from playing the game so many times and came up with very novel opening ideas were you impressed by alphazero have you have you seen some of the games i have seen some of the games i think impressed bewildered and motivated were the three things i experienced like i think magnus said he was also impressed that it could easily be mistaken for creativity that's his trash talk towards the ai that was a beautiful sentence i i was listening to the podcast i mean as a human i agree with him because you don't wanna give the machine the the the power of creativity but if it looks creative give it give it a compliment that's that's fair i i know that you're being nice to the machines in case they are ever looking back through this what what else is there what other principles are there for the the opening you can go a little bit more forward let's say and yeah we can finish full development positions like this and let's just say you developed all of your pieces mhmm i so that's like a really nice like nobody nobody took any pieces and we're just in a nice positional thing yeah so it it's not actually a very accurate one so i'm actually ridiculous i could put a different one on the board but usually after you've developed all of your pieces you wanna get your queen out a little bit to connect your rooks and you also start thinking about certain pawn pushes and getting more space but another good tip is just can you improve the position of your pieces think about timing so if you've already moved a piece once and there's a piece that hasn't moved at all then you wanna focus on the piece that hasn't moved at all to be able to have it more likely to jump into the game right so don't move pieces multiple times exactly like try to move it to the most optimal position yeah yeah that makes sense what so what's the indian so i i think we kinda went over it but why did you ever say why you like it so much because it's weird because it's king-size i liked it because it's a very fun aggressive defense where you're just throwing your pieces towards white and there's so many sacrificing opportunities and for some reason tactical games always feel like the most beautiful the most satisfying and that's what i liked about the king's indian but i also suffered a lot from this this love because i would play things that are not necessarily correct then my attack wouldn't pan out and i would just struggle the rest of the game having no play and just trying to defend so if you're always attack wikipedia also says that that you're known for your attacking play it's also known for losses according to stanford but let's not bring that see wikipedia doesn't talk traction it just it just says nicer is a lot nicer i actually played a lot of positional chess in classic because i really like the slow squeeze but when i transitioned to playing a lot of online chess it's almost as if i was looking for more instant gratification because it feels so much better to beat someone with an attack and even if sometimes it doesn't pan out i was okay with it because you get so many games in mhmm so i think my style in online chess really changed from my classical chess what about you andrea do you have a style are you attacking are you more like conservative defensive player are you chaotic opening wise i like to play more positionally like i like to push t four and just slowly improve my pieces and slowly get an attack but like alex said if you're playing bullet chess or blitz against viewers you often like wanna play riskier moves that may not be as good and then that's kind of when i would play more aggressive but i do enjoy tournaments for that reason because then like once your fifteen moves in which as soon as you're out of your prep i like sitting and thinking in more positional yeah positional middle games one of the games you found to be pretty cool is the hakkar and the kimura versus galfan in two thousand nine and that one i think includes the kings indian defense yes what's what's why is that an interesting one to you i also play the king's indian as black and i love this model game but and as alex was saying like all these advantages for the king's indian but now there's this one line that like every higher rated player just destroys my king's indian and you see these beautiful games and they're like ah yes i wanna play for these ideas but now no one plays into it anymore and you just get demolished so this is why i don't put the king's indian anymore but not through in the funner it's a love hate relationship truly the reality but that's like the higher level players do or does everybody yeah if you're studying openings and you know this line as white you just you automatically get the upper edge to choose kind of how openings develop you start having players trying new lines and then you see ones and then everybody adopts it if they think it's the best one but yeah so hikaru is really known for his aggressive style of play is hikaru black here or what yeah hikaru is black here so he's playing the kings indian and as you can see in this position white already has a lot a a huge center advantage but what hikaru is gonna start doing even with the next move is bringing all of his pieces towards the white king side because his plan is to start pushing his pawns towards the white king and ignore the attack that goes on his queen side dream attack with the king's indian so there's a complete asymmetry towards the king's side on the left side of the board is a a ton of pieces yeah exactly wow he moved the knight like three times in a row yep and and that's what you need to do because you have to move the knight in order to make space for your pawn so again this is why it's so counterintuitive and stockfish doesn't like it you're putting almost most of your pieces on the back rank and you're pushing your king side pawns and you're blocking your own dark squared bishop so none of it makes sense you're mimicking it that's awesome okay so yeah here you see white going for queen side attack black going for the king side attack and you can keep going a little bit and i'll wait to where he starts with the pretty sacrifices it's more fun to analyze games in person than on the computer i think yeah okay let's just go okay so here hikaru is preparing the attack and what i really like about this game is that he finds these tactics that are not necessarily what a computer would go for but it's very hard to face as a human and that's why a lot of people play the king's indian because in in practice it's hard to defend against so we can keep moving a little bit forward okay yep so white is just continuing the king side plan and no it's the fur is that like the first piece i think that's taken in the game yep that's the first trade so just begins exactly hikaru had to pause his attack for a little bit to just make sure that white didn't have two dire threats on the queen side so cool to see the asymmetry of this thing exactly that's what's beautiful about the king's idea one thing to highlight because his his rook move here is very bizarre and typically like a computer probably didn't like this but the ideas are interesting because this is a major weakness for black that they're coming to attack and he's also making room for his bishop to come backwards and challenge so this is like a human like maneuver that computer i i think computers would like this though because you have you'd have to move it regardless because he has he takes the pawn here and his rook would be under attack yeah well have you looked at it when i actually studied this as a line and this right away isn't the best move for cutting computer so actually that's just a good question did you guys when you study games use your own mind but do you also use computers to build up your intuition i was like looking at a position like this and what would a computer do and then try to understand why it wants to do that when i was studying seriously i would try to use my own mind because you're never gonna get the exact same position so you really need to notice trends and often computers will give you moves that are only specific to that position because of a certain tactic but i do use computers to check what i did and make sure i didn't make any obvious blunder that i might have missed what what does a computer tell you just like what what is the best move or does it give you any kind of explanation of why it doesn't tell you why but it gives you the different valuations of the position like black is down a half pawn here or something like that but it hints you towards what the right move is and then it's on you to figure out why and you could usually figure out why if not right away than just by going through a few moves and being like oh okay that makes sense i feel like a computer will take you down with some weird lines potentially about sacrifice like why the hell am i sacrificing this well we'll get to the pretty sacrifice soon so we could just keep playing for the odds are being pushed forward yeah i would and hikaru is kind of ignoring the queen side attack here they basically both only reply to each other's plan when they have to this is where you convert all the podcast viewers to youtube yeah because they have no idea what we're talking about right now there is a zen like experience of just like listening and imagining the board and just imagining the pieces on the ceiling yeah you should we should be calling them out and then people will be freaking out even more am i supposed to keep track of what the position is too late now it's too many how hard is blindfold chest have you tried like are you able to keep them on i've played blindfold chest before for me it's pretty hard it's not a muscle that i've trained as much and i'm very visual when it comes to chest but it is one as a a top player that starts becoming very second nature for you actually this is what i talked to magnus about this maybe i was again influenced by queen's gambit what do you actually visualize when it's in your head so for magnus it was a boring two d board right are you do you have some kind of that's every chess player no you don't have like because you know some chess like computer games you can do all kinds of skins and like yeah like fancy stuff you don't have any sadly i don't have like a cool three d warrior mode on it's just basic baseboard in my head because you don't yeah you can't use your brainpower for adding colors to it because you already have to keep track of the pieces as one board at a time yes okay the current position yeah i bet every chest i wonder if there's any who could get a feeling that you could be there who are really good and they can even play blindfold chess and play multiple games at the same time so i'm would be curious how they do it but usually when you're thinking of one game that's the only one in your mind yeah but you have to do this operation where you move one piece mhmm you're you're doing like the branch analysis like yeah and so you still have to somehow visualize the the the branching process and not forget stuff maybe that's like constant memory recall or something right you're always looking at one board at a time but and and you're also oh because you're also looking in the future yeah yeah because then you have to backtrack it i i guess you you're keeping the position in your memory so you're remembering where all the pieces are and then you're playing it out on one board and then you can come back to the initial one that you started with that you kinda just keep in your brain and it's also easier to come back to it once you've played a position from it i feel like it's that memory recall that gets you to blunder so i'll like see that i'm being attacked by certain things but then because i get so exhausted thinking about a different thing i forget i actually forget about an entire branch of things that i was supposed to be worried about it happens very often yeah if you spend a bunch of time calculating in a position let's say like when you're really in trouble and you're spending fifteen twenty minutes calculating you'll forget about something that you spotted like oh if i do these two three moves i'll walk into a trap because you've looked at so many lines and then you play it and then you see it and you're like oh i i looked at it and i saw it but i forgot about it yeah so you're it's often called tunneling where you're just looking so deeply on one thing you forget about the rest of the board and it's the worst when at least in a beginner level there's like a i don't know a bishop just sitting there obviously attacking your like queen or something and then you just forget that bishop exists yep because if they just sit there for a few moves and don't move you just forget their existence and then it's just yeah that's that's definitely very embarrassing well it happens to everyone so yes okay cool okay so we see a few trades happening on the queen side where he had to go for those otherwise he's in trouble and this is where the game oh sorry this is where it gets excited yeah so so nine h four is really when the sacrifice starts and here the two important pawns are the ones in front of the king because they're helping with the entire defense and yekaro is actually preparing to sacrifice his knight for a pawn just so that he can continue his attack and open up the position because if you don't do that here as black and don't get some kind of attack you are completely lost on the queen side and also you've pushed all of your own king side pawns so you're gonna be in danger so it's one of those do or die moments oh okay so that that's what makes it all in because the king is wide open yeah yeah the king is wide open and you all of white's pieces are pointed towards the queen side too where you're also cramped so is the attack primarily by black done by the two pawns and the in the knight and the light squared bishop is always extremely important so you don't wanna trade this in the king's indian because it's very helpful for a lot of attacks even though it's on the other side of the board i guess it can go all the way across in in like i i don't i'm not sure what it's doing here but probably threatening for example if if it was another move black could have played would be something like bishop h three where if you take the bishop you actually get mated on g two with what so let's say you take here and then you could push the pawn and then it would be checkmate so you're kinda using your your bishop to sacrifice against white's kingside pawns yeah i'll be freaking out if their bishop did that exactly what are they up to right and that's the thing this position looks very scary as white because all of black's pawns are starting to come towards you and it's one of those things where humans do start to worry in these positions whereas computers obviously can just calculate the best line and maybe the attack doesn't go through so so you're saying a computer might say that the white is actually a slight favorite here yeah essentially exactly okay so then white makes a little bit of room by moving the rook right and the attack begins i like i like the commentary here the the knight the knight is hugging the king and actually white can't even take the king here because an h four and h three is coming in white can't take the knight yeah oh did i say king yes thank you the knight white can't take the knight because why so if white takes the knight here then black starts pushing his pawn to h four with h three incoming and the idea of trying to defend against this is it it looks very difficult so white just chooses it'd be cool to watch a chess game to experience watching it without understanding it just for a day i feel like i could use that to make better content true okay i mean that's what getting drunk does unfortunately for chess players it never leaves your brain it's still doesn't matter how but this is actually a very cute move because black's queen is under attack but the king is so cramped that he can't actually take it or he's gonna get checkmated by a pawn which is a sad way to go truly yeah those pawns are doing a lot of work here they've got us the kings indian this is the kings indian player that pack of the kingside pawns yeah these pawns are like right so they're the ones that are doing a lot of the threatening right and they're also opening up the position to bring more of the pieces in but that the the pawns kind of help break open the king side but they can't checkmate by themselves so after the pawns come in that's when you need to start bringing in pieces as well which you will see hikaru do here okay there you go he puts one more sacrifice yes so this was actually another beautiful sacrifice in the game and but but then puts the king in check with a pawn right that and the pawn is going to be given here for free but the idea is you're giving your own piece because you want to have more space and open up the king which is what you're always trying to do when you have a king's side you're trying to remove as many of the king's defenders as you can without giving up too much of and then you have a ton of pieces on the king's side for black just waiting to exactly to do harm and then and and notice how every single move white is getting attacked like they're just never getting a break black just keeps throwing all their so it's funny that black's queen has been hanging for like three moves now and white still can't do anything about it yeah so rook puts the king in check yep the king runs and then again we leave the queen hanging and you develop a piece the slight squared bishop that's so important and you're once again threatening checkmate on g two and then bishop's coming to yeah once again the queen hanging i i mean the game is just so beautiful the amount of calculation hikaru put into this position it just feels like so much is in danger right it's so interesting and knight takes what all pawns so now his queen is attacked twice and he doesn't care he takes the bishop and he's still threatening the checkmate on g two and then the queen takes the bishop yep so now he's he's defending against g two and black just goes and and grabs some material back here so here black is already is winning well he he ends up winning a knight here because black had to be so much on the defensive they're just taking pieces yeah i mean at this point you're up two whole pieces so you you would really yeah exactly but and queen queen and then you take and then the rook takes and there's not as much of an attack on the king anymore but hikaru is up a knight here which is gg yeah what's the correct way of of of saying that because i'm a i i played demis hassabis i played him in chess mhmm and then i quickly realized like from his facial expressions that i should have like stopped playing oh it was like it's already set yeah when it's and then he's like like this is a good time to like give up right you're not gonna get to checkmate where like there's there you know he could see like mhmm the checkmate is like five or seven moves away or something this and what's the play usually you have to resign if you're in a position or you should through chess etiquette resign when you're in a position where your opponent is definitely gonna win out of respect like if you're a piece down and obviously all top grandmasters do that the only people who don't do that is kids because their coaches play till the get back always tell them never resign and they'll be in hopelessly lost positions playing against like two rooks a king and they only have their sole king but they're still playing on so so that's a position where it's obvious they can't win and because the kids might make errors yeah exactly might might as well that was the interesting thing about i i think game six of the previous world championship with magnus was it the one where he beat nepp yeah the first time he beat him where it was like he said that i don't know how often you come across this kind of situation he said the engines predict a draw yeah but that doesn't mean that it's going to be a draw so you play on mhmm hoping that you take a person into i mean this is i guess an endgame thing you take them to deep water and they make a positional mistake or something i don't i don't know when like he from his gut knows that this is supposed to be a draw but he still plays on yeah i mean that is one where it could theoretically be a draw but it could be very hard to defend because it's a hard technique to know as a human and especially in that game i know that nepo was also in time pressure which makes it even harder so in situations like that you should always continue it's more where an engine would give you something like plus ten or something where it's not just clearly a win but anybody would know how to win and that's where you're usually supposed to resign so what what do you find beautiful about this game is it the the the attacking chess and just the the the asymmetry of it it's the asymmetry and it's the fact that this is the dream for the king's indian where you're able to get a beautiful attack and there is also those two really nice sacrifices where black just continuously kept putting pressure on white's king to the point where he was able to win material and the best part of it is that the if the attack didn't work out black would have been completely lost how often does that happen by the way like as an attacking player you like how often do you put yourself in the position of like i'm screwed unless this works out on in online chess more than i should and it's usually when i sacrifice i know it's either gonna work or i'm lost and those are the most fun positions to play usually but in tournaments if you're doing a sacrifice you're playing it with a hundred percent confidence because you're taking the time to calculate it but yeah when you have three minutes you don't have time so you take a whim and you follow your intuition or and you find out later or you're very confident it'll work and you haven't calculated all the way until the end but you've calculated to the point where you have enough in exchange for the sack and you think you could play that position how do you train chess these days what's do you practice do you do deliberate practice i mean you're in this tough position because you're also a creator and educator and entertainer so do you try to put in time of like daily practice i don't train chess anymore when i'm focusing on creating i do if i'm preparing for a tournament but back in the day i would train very tournament very seriously for tournaments and the way it would work is i do opening preparation for a specific tournament because that's when you really need to have those lines memorized and you could also prepare for specific opponents and i would do tactics to make sure i stay sharp so those are the two things i would do every single day for a tournament and then mix up the rest with like maybe some end games maybe some positional chess so what does tactics preparation looks like do you do like a puzzle mhmm like like a random puzzle thing like yeah i would just train puzzles for at least like thirty to sixty minutes or books and sometimes you were and there's different kinds of puzzles one you could train for pattern recognition where you're supposed to go through them very quickly and that's just so that when you're playing the game if your mind is tired it's still keeping track of things a little bit more easily and then there's where you're practicing your combination and those sometimes take like twenty minutes to find because you have to just calculate a lot and it's more like making sure that you've trained with that muscle but andrea is actually very good at finding ways to balance and and still study while also doing content yeah so what you're able to do both that's the hard thing i was getting very irritated with content because i'm very competitive i i don't like playing chess if i'm losing and if you're talking and entertaining you're gonna be losing more games than winning so then i started doing more training streams where i'd bring on my coach and one of the things that i wanted to add to alex's training repertoire so i do i would do daily puzzles every time i'm streaming which helped me a lot even if it's like there's this thing on chess dot com called puzzle rush where you have three minutes and you just do puzzle after puzzle where they get incrementally harder and it's just a really good way to build your pattern recognition especially when you're rusty so i would do that till i hit a high score and i wouldn't play any blitz until i hit the score that i want but that's kind of more like the fun part of chess studying the very important one is actually analyzing your losses in your tournament games and first you sit and you look through your mistake yourself and try to see if you can find the better moves and then that's why you know we would check over with the computer to see if you're right so game analysis is also very important which i try to do i remember to give a shout out i listened to a couple of episodes of the perpetual chess podcast which is pretty good but what with the whatever i listened to i remember the per it's i think they really focus on like teaching people how to train yeah how to play how to train all that kind of stuff they they do like yeah i'm looking now adult improver so basically like how do regular noobs get better at chess yeah one of the things that one of the person that said i think he was the grand master but he said to maximize the amount of time you spend every day of like basically as you were saying like suffering so like you it's not about the like you should be thinking you should be doing calculating so it's the opposite of what magnus said like you should be doing a lot of time it doesn't matter what the puzzle is or whatever the hell you're doing but you should be like doing that difficult calculation that's how you get better yeah it really depends what you're training because i used to think the same but it depends what you're weaker at because if you're doing the really difficult puzzles you're training for like visualization and calculating more moves ahead than you typically would which maybe you wouldn't get into that as often in a regular game because typically you run into like three to four tactics which are actually the easier and more fun ones to solve so really depends and on top of that as a hobbyist your motivation is very different than when you're playing from a young age and have pretty high competitive ambition and a lot of people who are new to chess you could basically work on anything and still improve right so if you're focusing on something you like you're probably gonna stick to it more and be more consistent which i think is more helpful long term what was the most embarrassing loss of your career i had so many flashbacks but i'm so glad it's a question for andrea i like that you specified you know it's funny because i mean because you said you're so competitive and like yeah no no i i could tell just even from the way you said it that it like you hate losing i yeah i mean that was the reason i hated chess in high school because it'd always be like but but okay there's many traumatizing losses where it's feel like you're top three you're running for first and then you throw a game you shouldn't but and this shouldn't hurt my ego as much as it does but it's always kids or when i was a high school girl it's the younger boys who are really cocky yeah and when they win they start rubbing it in your face and they're yawning and looking around when like ninety percent of the game you are destroying them and you had this one tiny mistake and now their ego is huge but i'll never forget i was playing like for a chess scholarship and i was it was tie breaker for first and i think i lost to a twelve year old girl who couldn't even use the scholarship but she beat me and won first place and she got some other prize so yeah i was losing to that little girl who's literally like twenty three hundred now so makes sense right you keep telling yourself that what do you think because what do you what do you do you think kasparov was feeling that when he was playing thirteen year old magnus like yeah why as much as it's a beauty of the sport that any age can be brilliant any demographic anything i feel like when you're adults and you're paired against the kid it's just hard not to let it get to and it depends maybe if they're a really sweet kid but most of the times i play kids they're just really arrogant and but i don't think they do it intentionally because they're kids i mean there is a certain etiquette thing where like like you say yawning and in general like it's not kids there's no etiquette yeah they don't care yeah the kids traumatized me too i was playing in vegas and it was not even my opponent it was the board next to me and the kid was at least ten years old made twelve max and he was playing against an adult and he takes out his hand and he starts doing a fake phone mhmm to which the kid studying sitting across diagonally picks up their banana and starts talking like it's a phone and they're just mouthing words while their two adult opponents are thinking intensely at the game and then i see the adult look up look at the kid just making banana cone and then stare in his eyes as he sighs yeah and they're not even doing it for trash talk no no no they're just bored bored kids yes exactly what what was the because you you play a bunch of people for for your channel what was the most like memorable what's the most fun most intense there's a bunch of fun ones you've played kids before some trash talking kids that sounds great they trash talk kids yeah nothing like a losing seven twelve year old who then starts doing a fortnite dance yeah so that that actually happened that did happen he he is you know a very young master i think he became master when he was like nine years old or something and he's very good at chess and doing a lot of training but he's also incredibly good at trash talking and he beat me one game and he stood up and he started doing the fortnite dance so you know you gotta just swallow your pride in those moments what is that culture of like street chess players it seems it seems pretty interesting like i don't know that seems to be celebrating the beauty of the game it's the trash talking but also having fun with it but also taking it seriously and you've done a a few of those did you did you go to new york yeah in union square park in washington square what was that like it's such a unique place i haven't seen it anywhere else in the us where people are just professional chess hustlers even if they're not necessarily you know a top player but they play chess every single day and so many of them learn chess by themselves and never had a professional coach so they are quite good at it they're also very tight knit they all know each other and it's a very social thing where you're not just playing chess it's the experience of getting to know this person who's a very much a personality and they talk to you they could either give you tips or they could be really chatty and talk to you during so it's a chess experience rather than just playing a game do you tell them like what your rating is or do you just let people just like both ways do you discover how good the actual the person actually is initially i loved going and not telling people my rating and just surprising them and and winning games but now we've gone so many times that they just know us so we can't get away with it anymore so one time actually i don't know if i should share this but one time we dressed up as grandmothers and we had prosthetics on our face yeah and i think they still recognized us yeah it's probably the there's other components like probably the trash talk and all that good stuff actually no it was funny we were talking like grandmothers but it was the way i helped it was the way i grandmother talk like you don't wanna back in my day drink ask no no ask we're not bringing wants a bong bun we're not bringing the bong bun okay what were your names what were the code names oh my god i think it was edna edna four seven i had a really i can't remember the other one but it was embarrassing because we were walking so slowly and andrea dropped her cane or something at one point then people in the park they were to help her we felt so embarrassed thought bombs but but yeah it was funny because they didn't know it was us until he saw the way i reached for my pawn and he said the way you held your pawn i knew it was you it was like such a sneeze thing that was what blew the grandma cover yeah do you have a style of how you play physically is that is that under the best until grandma went to play chess but yeah i've never thought about that yeah i think our style is just trash talking now style is very if you're talking about style on in youtube and twitch we definitely have a distinctive style what's that what's your distinctive i'm just talking shit but but not going too far no no definitely that's definitely going to if it's us two against each other oh we we trash talk each each other so hard so brutal love looking at andrea and watching her little nose crunch up as she's annoyed and the satisfaction i get when that happens how many times do you play against each other on online publicly i think i've seen a couple of games we've played a lot of times we try not to do it too often because it's repetitive but every now and then when we haven't done it for a while we'll go at it again what do you mean repetitive is like is that implied trash talk right there no it just we we play similar openings so we just start seeing the same position too often each other every time and andrea is really good at openings so i just start playing bad openings to get her out of her preparation because i don't like opening theory very much i just like playing the game and getting into middle games and end games but but yeah typically the only time we're playing each other is when we're setting up in the park and we don't have opponents yet and we need content so we just play each other till people show up but we always put stakes on the line which makes it very interesting because otherwise it wouldn't be fun to play each other if there's no stakes where's where's the most fun place you've you've played is it new york i think so and it was actually when we set up in times square one night we just brought a table with us and chess and it's not even where people usually play chess but it was so lively there were all of the lights out and so many people just kept stopping by to play chess and it was really one of my favorite streams just the opposite of like the classical chess world it's super loud there's music there's cars there's street dancers even some naked people walking around who we had to be careful not to get banned yeah but i honestly really like the chaotic environments for chess games because i think it's a good way to break more into the mainstream culture and make it entertaining and appealing to anyone who doesn't know anything about chess so that's why we let it and also in an authentic way because it's what we really like about chess when you're just enjoying the game but also the atmosphere and the people who you're playing with and and that's one of the things that i think you see less when you're just thinking of chess as a competitive thing you've you mentioned a few other games like the bobby fischer games the candidate smash the game of the century which i feel like is a is a weird game to call the game of the century when there's still like a few decades left in the century but yeah i mean it wasn't an official thing it was just the chess journalist on a chess article but but it stuck if you look at yeah no it didn't stick stick this is all i do research wise because there's so that particular one was a thirteen year old fisher mhmm and he did a queen sacrifice i wonder is there's that movie searching for bobby fisher mhmm was that related because didn't they have a young somebody who's supposed to be kinda like bobby fischer played by josh waitz skin yeah i think he ended up being an international master it wasn't based on bobby fischer it was based on another player but i liked how they told it through the lens of being inspired by bobby fischer do you remember that game like why why do you think it was dubbed the game of the century it was just journalists being like i i think part of it was the atmosphere where you have the us junior champion who's this thirteen year old nobody and it's the first time he's playing in a very competitive landscape against some of the top american players and he goes up against an international master so somebody who's a lot stronger than he is who's played in you know olympiads for the american team he's having a bad tournament but then he has this one game where he just shows off his tactical prowess and plays incredibly well and i don't know if this is true but in the paper clippings of it they'd say things like grandmasters were by the board and they would say things like oh bobby is lost in this position what is he doing but there's this thirteen year old kid who's just playing incredibly well and then that also happened before bobby's started really rapidly improving at chess not that people knew that but he kinda seemed like a rising star so i think the game was beautiful but i also think the idea of a thirteen year old kid coming out from nowhere and beating a top american player was very fascinating and there was aggressive chess and it was and the interesting ideas yep yeah taking big risks it's cool to see a thirteen year old do that yeah what about the you you mentioned that his match against mark taimana from their seventy one candidates match was interesting in some way why is it interesting to you move forty five i'm i'm looking at some notes also this is with the bishop e three i think i know which one you're talking about it's i wouldn't say a lot of these games on these lists i think are really great combinations that that when tactics come into play which is what we're talking about but they're very good at exemplifying lessons this is why you study famous games so you can apply these lessons to your own games and i think the main takeaway for this one was they were punishing their opponent from steering away from opening principles which is something that we learned learned a little earlier where he delayed the development of his king and put his queen out a little bit too exposed so bobby fischer immediately punished that and then there was just like a beautiful combination where it was like a twelve in a row perfect moves which was a tactic just winning the game but it only came from punishing those mistakes the mistake being bringing the queen out bringing the queen out and yeah not castling your king right away okay and these were just like opening principles that now they're written in books but but for books you would study these principles by studying games and also i'm looking at some notes his dominance during the candidate's turn was unprecedented he swept two top grandmasters i mean that guy's meteoric rise is incredible it's sad that i think at whatever in his twenties he then quit chess one has to wonder what where he could have gone yeah it is sad that we lost such a brilliant mind so early on and it's also sad i think kind of what ended up happening in his life and the slowly going crazier is there some aspect of chess that opens the door to crazy like like how challenging it is on you the stress the anxiety of it the the isolation and being alone yeah because it's a very lonely sport it is even do do you guys since you both play it it's still lonely the experience of it it was when i was competing a lot i think the crazy part of it for me was how obsessed you can get about a board game right where you're optimizing your entire life to beat another person at you know pushing wooden pieces across the board and it doesn't necessarily translate to other things and the fact that so many people spend so much of their life on it but you can also spend so much of your life because it's so deep and so interesting and i i mean i've definitely experienced moments where i didn't want to do anything but chess and i had that before i went to college where i just wanted to take a gap year and focus on chess because i still i went to high school we moved a lot there was always other things going on so i felt like i could never really focus on chess and the one time i could by taking a gap year i ended up not doing because my parents really wanted me to go to university right away but i think maybe if i had taken that gap year i don't know if i would have gone back to school so maybe it wasn't a bad thing i'd also say that's pretty universal i think if you wanna be the best at anything you do or any sport you have to be that level of obsessed so i don't know if that's only chess well some things some obsessions are more transferable to a a balanced social life that is true like healthy development than others a lot less social than most other sports yeah there's something deeply isolating about this game i mean the the great chess players i've met i mean they it's like it's really competitive too mhmm and there's something that you're almost nonstop paranoid about blundering at every level and that develops a person who's really anxious about losing versus someone who like deeply enjoys perfection or winning and so on it's just this constant paranoia about losing maybe i'm like misinterpreting it but that gets that that creates huge amount of stress mhmm over like thousands of games especially in a young person and and that blundering is such a painful experience because you could be playing a game that you've played for five six hours and you have one lapse in focus and you blunder and you throw the entire game away and sometimes not just the entire game but the entire tournament now you can't place or do anything anymore so you just feel those mistakes so strongly yeah there's no one to blame but yourself are you are you as hard on yourself have you have you been about losing like before you became super famous for streaming where you could be like well fuck this at least i can i can so i was really hard on myself and i went to play a tournament in canada to try to qualify for the olympiad team and i was like well i'm an adult now i'm not gonna feel emotional if i lose and then i got there on the first day i think i was ranked like fourth in canada for for females and i'll how long ago was this this was like earlier in the year actually mhmm and i go and i lose to somebody lower rated on the first day and i think it was because i blundered and i went back to my room and i was like i am not an adult i'm not eating i'm not leaving this room i feel terrible and i know i shouldn't but it just cuts so deep and then i actually ended up qualifying for the olympiad team but i didn't wanna play because i didn't have enough time to train and the losses are so painful that i was like it's not worth it yeah it's in high school and growing up i was i just remember weekends and i i think being competitive in any sport again probably people relate to this which is like yep spending weekends crying and even like alex said like punishing yourself because you're disappointed in yourself because you fight so hard and you prepare and you study and you're like oh i yeah but that that's once again on on the bright side though when you're studying so hard and after like a four hour game and you actually are on the opposite end and you win you feel like such a huge rush of dopamine and serotonin and you're like on a high from the win so there's also plus sides or you can turn this around but yeah like alex said like losing after preparing for something and fighting on hours and hours is the worst feeling in the world did you ever get anything like that with martial arts yeah so you know wrestling i wrestled all through high school and middle school definitely so it's an individual sport i did a lot of individual sport tennis those kinds of things but i think even with wrestling and tennis you're still on a team right you can still like there's still a camaraderie there i feel like with chess especially you go on your own with the tournaments like it you really are alone but i i mean i always personally just had a like a very self critical mind in general i would not this is one of the reasons i decided not to play chess because i think when i was really young i met somebody who was able to play blindfold chess yeah they were teaching me they were laying in there on the couch trash drinking and smoking and there were sounds like a russian yeah exactly they're now a a faculty somewhere in the united states i i forget where but he making jokes talking to others and he would move the pieces like he would yell across the room mhmm and i remember thinking that if a person is able to do that then that kind of world you can live in inside your mind that's becomes the chessboard to me that meant like the chessboard is not just out here it could be in here and you could do these beaut you can create these beautiful patterns in your mind i thought like i had such a strong pull towards that or where i had to decide either i'm gonna dedicate everything to this or not you can't do half assed and then i that's when i decided to to walk away from it because i had so much other beautiful things in my life i loved mathematics i loved everything was beautiful to me i thought chess would pull me all in mhmm and there was nothing like it i think in my whole life since then i think it's such a dangerous addiction yeah it's such a beautiful addiction but it's a dangerous one depending on what your mind is like it reminds me of something i thought of before i stopped competing as much and i'd look at people and think imagine being so intelligent that you could become a grand master and yet only spending the rest of your life being a grand master because it's one of those things where it does require a lot of mental power but by doing chess you're not gonna be able to explore other subjects deeply yeah and and not in a way that is is bad necessarily more an admiration and wondering what else could have been because i've just seen people get to these levels of obsession where it's all they wanna do and they're grandmasters but they're not even top players so they're never gonna make a living out of it they'll make like maybe thirty forty k a year max they can't even focus on their competitive chest because they have to supplement it by you know teaching and doing things they don't like and it's just because of how strong of an obsession it can be because it truly is very intellectually rewarding and i think that's what people are addicted to in the self improvement but you can get that from a lot of other things as well well i think for me what i was inspired by that stuck with me is that a human being could be so good at one thing right but to to me that person on the college drinking and so on i i assumed he was the best chess player in the world like that to be able to play inside your head right it just felt like a feat that's incredible and so i fell in love with the idea that i hope to be something like that in my life at something mhmm it's it would be pretty cool to be really good at one thing and like life in some sense is a search for the things that you could be that good at i didn't even think about like how much money does it make or any of that is can i fall in love with something and make it a life pursuit where i can be damn good at it and the being damn good at it is the source of enjoyment not not like not to win because you wanna win a tournament or win because like you just wanna be better at somebody else no it's for the beauty of the game itself or the beauty of the activity itself and then you realize that that's one of the compelling things about chess it is a game with rules and you can win if you wanna be really damn good in some aspect of life like that it's it's it's harder it's it's a harder and weirder pursuit don't you feel like you kind of did that with computer science or ai related things like getting that level of damn good that's one of the cool things about ai and robotics or intellectual pursuits or scientific pursuits is you can spend until you're eighty doing it so i'm in the early days of that one of the thing reasons i came to texas one of the reasons i didn't wanna pursue an academic career at mit is i wanna build a company and so that's i'm in the early days of that ai company and so it's an open world to see if i'm actually going to be good at it but the thing that's there that i've been cognizant of my whole life is that i have a passion for it something within me draws me to that thing and you have to listen to that to that voice so with chess you're fucked unless you like early on are really training really hard mhmm i think life is more forgiving you can be you can be world class at a thing after after making a lot of mistakes and after spending the first few decades of your life doing something completely different and chess is like it's like an olympic sport like there's no perfection is a requirement is a necessity what do you think is that pursuit for you like why did you decide to stream what what drew you i like these questions now we're really getting deep yeah this is like a therapy session i mean what isn't it terrifying to be in front of a camera well it's terrifying to be in front of five cameras in the set of it corrections six six okay it's more terrifying for me to try to remember if i actually turn them all like i mentioned to you off mic i'm still suffering from a bit of ptsd after screwing up a recording of magnus i i he had to console me because that was the thing is i felt okay you wanna you wanna build robots if you can't get a camera to even run correctly how are you gonna do anything else in life oh no you can't let it spiral like that it it was spiraling hard yeah and i was just laying there and just just feeling sorry for myself but i think that feeling by the way on the small tangent is really useful like yeah i feel like a lot of growing happens when you feel shitty as long as long as you can get out of it like don't let it spiral like indefinitely but just feeling really really shitty about everything in my life like i was having existential crisis like how i how will i be able to do anything at all like this is your giant failure all those kinds of negative voices but i think i made some good decisions in the in the week after that hopefully i'll tell you couldn't have made those decisions if you were less hard on yourself me personally no i'm too lazy okay so you really need to be angry at yourself enough to go and do what you it's not even angry it's just upset of being self critical like also for me personally because i don't have proclivities for depression i have a lot more room to feel extremely shitty about myself so if you if you're somebody that can get stuck in that place like clinically depressed you have to be really really careful you have to notice the triggers you don't wanna get into that place but for me just looking empirically feeling shitty has always been productive like it makes me long term happier ultimately it makes me more grateful to be alive it helps me grow all those kinds of things so i kinda embrace it otherwise i feel like i will never do anything i have to feel shitty but that's not a thing i prescribe to others there's a there's a a famous professor at mit his name is marvin minsky and when he was giving advice about like to to students he said the secret to my success was that i always hated everything i did in the in in the past so always sort of being self critical about everything you've accomplished never really take a moment of gratitude and i think for a lot of people that hear that that's not good you should be you should like take a pause and be grateful but it really worked for him so it's you know it's a choice you have to make yeah it reminds me of the quote be happy but never satisfied mhmm where you can have a positive spin and still want to improve yourself but yeah like when did you decide to take a step in the spotlight that terrifying spotlight of the internet it was actually my senior year of college and i was really busy with work and school and chess was kind of like this lost love and the interesting thing is that the longer i don't play chess the more i kind of miss playing it casually and enjoy it more because then i start looking at it with fresh eyes but i didn't have time to play tournaments so i started streaming online because it was more social than just playing strangers on the internet without knowing anything about who they are and i started slowly growing a community and got in touch with chess dot com pretty quickly too so then it was this hobby that i would do once a week every thursday at eight pm and it was one of the things that brought me a lot of joy and actually i speaking of depression did struggle for was you know at least ten years of my life and it was one of those things where chess and streaming was such a distraction and it brought me such great joy that i just kept doing it because i really really liked it and then i was working on something that didn't pan out and decided to go and take a risk and just stream full time which you know seemed a little bit weird at the moment but was that terrifying that leap it was terrifying but i had taken so many terrifying leaps in the past and they didn't and you know the last two hadn't worked out but i was like well i'll i'll get it eventually so some somehow having failed before and going through failure and knowing that'll be okay made me more likely to just try something that was a very very weird job goodbye camera i saw it die yeah the the camera we don't need it okay but one of the cameras we have another five yeah i know like this is where this triggers the spiral alexis can i go ahead and send them it's still it's still somehow awake is there advice you can give about the dark places you've gone in your mind the depression you suffered from how to get out from your own from your own story whenever i go to those really dark places the scariest thing is that it feels like i will never get rid of this feeling and it is very overwhelming and i just have to kind of look back over time spans and remember that every single time i have got through it and remind myself that it is just temporary and that has been the most helpful thing for me because i just try to combat the scariest thing about it and then believe have faith that it's gonna like this will go away and take action obviously to make sure it goes away and i've also tried to spin it as depression is one of the hardest things i've had to deal with but also one of the biggest motivators because if i just am left with my own brain i get very depressed then i really like working or focusing on things so it actually pushed me to you know try to focus on school try to focus on chess focus on whatever i'm doing and also if i'm feeling really bad then there's probably something a little bit off and i use it as a signal and try to think of it as okay this is just a sign that there's things that could be improved for long term what about you andrea have you gone to dark places in your mind i'd say i my family like like i i see alex going through this my mom also has very serious depression luckily i got the genes where i don't go through that serious level of depression that they do i'd say mine is much more temporarily so it's more similar to what what i was feeling when i was exactly feeling shitty about periods yes exactly where like but i know that it's not something that's clinical and that's just a genetic thing or a a mental thing whereas i know it's more serious for like my family members and i did relate a lot with you where you're saying where that really pushes you and i felt that a lot through content where you're just kinda feel hopeless and kind of like an existential crisis where i don't like the content i'm doing and that's what pushes me to like okay you have no choice but to try something that now you're gonna be passionate about because otherwise you're gonna be stuck in this this never ending cycle so it does it's short term and then it helps me come up with the things that i enjoy the most content wise and it also long term taught me just how to have a more balanced life like doing small things that make me happier on a daily basis to like working out to eating healthier which i notice when i don't do for weeks i just get a lot more depressed what has playing chess taught you about life has it has it made you better at life in any kind of way or has it made you worse you know a lot of people kinda romanticize the idea that chess is kinda like life or life is kinda like chess yeah and becoming better at making decisions on the chessboard is gonna make you better at making decisions in life is there some truth to that i always shy away from these comparisons with chess and life because yeah it has both positives and negatives so one thing it really helps develop from an early age is having an analytical mind but then you could also get like paralysis of analysis where you've just thought of everything to death and you're moving too slowly when you just have to keep going forward because there's not a great path ahead so it's more like exercising your brain and staying sharp and then also applying that to other things whereas if instead of playing chess you're watching tv or something like that you'd probably end up being less sharp yeah i used to in high school i'd always preach like ah chess transfers to life skills that college of physics i i taught chess for juvenile department for special education school i had site studies in prisons where like oh playing chess helped them with x and for your kids it helps with teamwork and thinking over life choices and now that i'm older i don't believe in any of that bs but i do think that the process of working really hard at something which takes really long to see results and you have to be really dedicated and like i remember in high school and in middle school well all my friends they were having fun on the weekends and i'd have to be there studying two hours of chess a day and knowing one day it'll pay off but for like two three years nothing paid off kind of learning that type of patience with anything it's like you know like getting a real job i can't say i ever really worked a real job in my life since i went straight into streaming and i got to work for myself but i'd say it's what people go to college for like they learn how to live in the real world and i'd say that that's what chess taught me as a kid when you're streaming when you're when you're doing the the creative work do you feel lonely mhmm so a bunch of creators talk about sort of the it's it's counterintuitive because you're famous now but it's you know sort of not quite but we're very lucky to have each other so is that the source of the the comfort and like is there some sense where it's isolating to have these personalities they have to to to be always be having fun being wild and so on i or is it actually the opposite like is it a source of comfort to know that there's so many cool people out there that are giving you their love it started as a source of comfort because it started with a very small community who would be something it would be around two hundred to three hundred viewers and you know only like thirty to forty of them would actually chat actively so you felt like it was a community not an audience so you like knew them personally almost yeah exactly and it was people who were interested in chess and i would really enjoy that and then as you know we started growing bigger the audience kind of changed where they're not there for you personally they're there while you're entertaining and it changed for me and i ended up being a lot more self conscious of things online and started even thinking of myself more like a product than a human being when i'm online because i had to brand yes exactly otherwise you just start taking everything personally that people comment about you and it's based off of very small i see so it's almost a kind of a defense mechanism exactly and it took time to get a because even if you have tough skin eventually it gets to you when you're online every single day listening to you know thousands of people's feedback on you i think the loneliest part of being a creator is going through burnout which everyone is just it's bound to happen which is why i think we're very lucky that we have each other because right it's a numbers game and you're viral and trendy at one point and then you have to fall and then there's months where you're just grinding and i just come to the bathroom i'm like andrea we're relevant to kids that's that's really like the worst part of being creator and figuring out how to get over that hump but it makes me very grateful that i have my sister because i know that i'm not the only person going through it and yeah i know that most of my creator friends feel very lonely in that process because they don't have someone who's their family and their business partner and they're working by each other side by side you kinda tie in your self worth to your job and your content and maybe even more extremely than other jobs because you also are the entire company and the entire product so when things are going well or when things are not you just need to be careful to not reflect it like oh i am doing bad i am better other than the trends have now changed there's outside things we're gonna keep going and this is just the normal waves which is how we think about it now and also just about are we enjoying it this is this what we wanna make but we were stuck in the the camp for a while when we ten x'd our viewership after the pandemic because people were home and playing chess and then of course that dropped by like seventy percent and then you see that and you're trying your best and you just kind of have to deal with it and be like okay i'm just gonna keep persevering and maybe it'll get better that's so fascinating i mean this is a a struggle of sorts in the twenty first century of like how to be an artist how to be a creator how to be an interesting mind in response to this algorithm i'm telling you turning off views and likes is is really good i i don't look at twitch views for that reason and i get obsessed with the numbers too and i know andrea does but for me what i try now is to be more focused in the moment but andrea somehow can do it even with abuse so you just you get you have fun with it it it like oh number one cup too much of like a given to the temporary satisfaction like i like seeing i'd like knowing that if something happens right now viewership's gonna boost by couple hundred and seeing that i'm right of course but what about when the viewers start dropping well and i always like you just have this intuition now and but i think also the reason that it doesn't affect me so much is when we first started our content journey we were only twitch streamers and we our livelihood were based on twitch viewers but now like i've learned how to recycle that content into like youtube and shorts and other things where i know like okay if this stream does badly there's so many more things you can do that also just have a much larger output so it doesn't get to me as much as it did do you ever feel that with your podcast or do you feel like it's been authentic since the start no so there's there's there's a million things to say there so one is there's a reason i stopped taking a salary at mit and moved to texas is i wanted my bank account to go to zero because i do my best with my back against the wall so one of the comforts i have is i don't care if this podcast is popular or not i want it to not be popular so i don't want it to make money failing lex yeah i want i wanna i mean i just do best when i'm more desperate that's like one thing to say seems like a reoccurring theme with how you build up your greatest work which is honestly very respectful yeah so i think you this is like a i wouldn't recommend it right thank you for finding don't try it at all the silver lining for an unhealthy mental state but the other thing is i was very conscious just like with chess and those kinds of things that i love numbers and i i would be if i paid attention if i tried to be somebody at their best like a mister beast who really pays attention to numbers i would just not i'd be become destroyed by it the highs and lows of it and i just don't think i would be creating the best work possible but one of the i mean there one of the big benefits of a podcast is listeners and there's an intimacy with the voice and i think that is much more stable and a a deeper and a more meaningful connection than youtube youtube is a fickle mistress so it's like it's a weird drug that like it really wants to very addicting feedback loops when you have a video that's number one out of ten yeah oh my god the the adrenaline you get and then the the thing i really don't like also is the world like will introduce you as a a person that has a video on youtube with some x number of views like the world wants you to be addicted to these numbers because they associate it with having done a good job yeah because that's what people think views are even if it's not right and because and primarily because they don't have any other signal of what's a good job i think the much better signal is people that are close to you your family your colleagues that say wow that was cool i listened to that that was really i didn't know this this was really powerful this is really moving and so on but definitely i'm terrified of numbers because i i feel like just like i said i'd rather be i would i'd rather be a stanley kubrick right you you are you'd rather create great art like not to be pretentious but the best possible thing you can create whatever the beauty that's the capacity for creating beauty that's in you i would like to maximize that and i feel like for some people like mister beast i think those are perfectly aligned mhmm because he just loves the most epic thing possible but not for everybody i think there's a lot of people for whom that's not perfectly aligned and and so i'm definitely one of those and i'm still really confused by anybody who listens to this thing anyway but that's also something i guess you're trying to find yeah trying to figure out i i get very afraid of ever becoming someone who just makes junk food content where you can't stop while you're in the moment and it has all of your attention but when you're done it didn't really bring any value to your life which is something that i think the algorithm still does really reward and making sure that as we are learning how to create better content it's still something that is gonna be meaningful long term well ultimately you know you inspire a lot of young people this so the are the best when we get messages from people who are like i played you a year ago and my rating was fourteen hundred and now i'm nineteen hundred i'd like to challenge you again and it's a fourteen year old writing a former email those things are always very very fun to get and even just outside of chess it's just empowering to see and like for young women too to see that kind of thing i mean you guys are being yourself and making money for being yourself and having fun and like growing as human beings which i think is really inspiring for people to see so in that sense it's really rewarding and then like the way i think about it is there is some benefit of doing entertaining type of stuff so that you get to kinda like mister beast does with philanthropy right yeah the bigger mister beast becomes the more effective he is at actually doing positive impact on the world so right those things are tied tied together but of course with with with podcast you guys well maybe you have these kinds of tense things but what kind of ideas what kind of people do platform what kind of person what what kind of human being do you wanna be because you actually are becoming a person and a set of ideas in front of the public eye and you have to ask yourself that question really hard like really seriously because if you're doing stuff in private you have the complete luxury to try shit out right i think you have less of a luxury to try shit out because the internet can be vicious in punishing you for trying shit out and do you think that's sometimes a bad thing where you have less freedom to make mistakes yeah you have two choices so one you put up a wall and say i don't give a shit what people think i don't like doing that because i like being fragile to the world and keeping my sort of wearing my heart on my sleeve or the other one yeah you have to be you have to you have to actually think through what you're gonna say you have to think of like what do i believe you you have to be more serious about what you put out there it's it's annoying but it's also actually you should have always been doing that you should be deliberate with your actions and your words but i don't know it's a but some of it it's it's such a balance because some of my favorite people are brilliant people that allow themselves to act ridiculous and be silly elon musk who's become a good friend is the silliest human of all i mean he's incredibly brilliant and productive and so on but allows himself to be silly and that that's also inspiring to people like you don't have to be perfect you don't have to you can be a weird a giant weird mess and it's okay so it's a it's a balance i think when you start to delve into political topics into topics that really get tense for people then you have to be a little bit more careful and deliberate but it's also wise to stay stay the hell away from those topics in general like i mentioned to you offline somebody i i've been debating whether i want to talk to or not is karjakin on the chessboard because you know chess is just a game but throughout the history of the twentieth century it was played between the russians and the americans and so on where they were at war cold or hot war and those are interesting those those are interesting conversations to be had at the olympics and so on it's not just a game in some sense it's like a mini war and so i have to decide whether i wanna talk to to him or not and those kinds of things you have to make those kinds of decisions for now you guys are not playing chess with with donald trump or obama or so on we are not right now no how long is the stream like a few hours right now they're two to three hours when i was first streaming i'd stream for like six hours a day a day at least usually yeah for like seven six to seven days a week doing just like a talking one no i'd be playing chess the entire time while talking and when i started streaming that's kind of how everybody blows up on twitch you're just putting in crazy hours and you're always there it's not about making the best content it's about letting people feel like they're hanging out with you mhmm and just being on as much as you can but i ended up feeling very burnt out because it's hard to be your best self when you're in front of a camera for that long because you do get scared of going into places where you wanna learn but you might not be the best in because it's harder to learn in public than do something that like yeah we're better than ninety nine percent of our viewers at chess so that's a lot less scary than trying to play a game that you're bad at or discuss topics that you're interested in yeah be have the beginner's mind and be dumb at something right yeah which is where the fun is and you get to learn together but people punish you for it on the internet what about you andrea yeah i think like alex said at the beginning when we were grinding a lot you don't really even have time for much of a private life because you're streaming every hour of your life and people want it like the appeal of streamers it's called like being parasocial where you feel like they're your friend and they like it because they want you to share everything about your life really the main challenge for me at first when trying to prioritize quantity over quality which we're not doing anymore was realizing that i can't turn everything i'm interested in and every passion into content yeah before i'm like well i must stream more but i like music and i like playing piano and i like reading into these topics and i like fitness and then i try to livestream all of it and that's just at some point it's like just enjoy your time off for those hobbies and prioritize what you're good at because that's just gonna be better for the channel overall so that was a learning lesson for sure it it's nice because there are some intersections when i have tried new things that i really enjoy and it pays off but that's more less often so it's more like you can be yourself but only specific parts of yourself online and the rest sometimes it's nice to just keep private and feel that you could just give it your a hundred percent freedom see i i i feel like i try to be the exact same person on podcast as in private life i really don't like hiding anything but you're also a generalist right where you have people with all topics for us we built our audience off of very specific things so people sometimes feel like even at the start when we started playing less chess they're like i subbed for chess why are you not playing chess exactly people are tuning in for an interesting conversation on a bunch of topics so like the more you are yourself the better it is but it is very hard when you build your brand on like one type of gaming content build your brand but yeah the way you become a journalist is you slowly expand mhmm it's like like expand to checkers i guess that's that's like downward feature poker yeah exactly poker but also just the ideas the space of ideas and then one of the cool things about chess is when you're talking over the chessboard you're it's it's a kind of podcast you know that is actually an idea we've had with playing chess while also doing a podcast and talking with people it's kind of like an icebreaker where you're also focusing on the game at the same time but you know we are slowly evolving and we're doing more things like one thing we wanted to do is spend less time in front of the computer so now we're doing a chess travel show where we go to different countries and look at the chess culture so it actually feels like we're doing things that we would wanna do and explore anyway and maybe it's not as much in the idea space which we both enjoy and do a lot in our own free time but in the sharing cool experiences with our audience that we actually wanna do where do you look forward to going we're going to romania in on september ninth and i think this is the most exciting for me because we're going back to you know the country where our entire family is from where our grandmother taught our dad who taught us how to play chess it has a very strong chess culture so it'll be very unique to go back and see how everything is when we haven't been back for a very long time and for romanians like it's very rare when there's like a famous romanian who accomplishes something which is why like right now andrew tate's the most famous romanian but he's banned so it's fun exactly and there's like something very special about romanian pride and when we meet fellow romanians in the us like it's just an amazing connection and like i hear the way my dad talk about like for example nadia who was a famous romanian gymnast and he's like yeah like romania we sucked at everything but when she won the olympics for gymnasts every kid on the street was doing gymnastics because it's very rare that they make it to that level of success i'm not saying that we're super successful super famous but it is really cool to meet other romanians through chess because it's a very special bond you you you feel like it's a community and like you belong yeah you can't get that anywhere else let me ask your opinion since you mentioned him andrew tate you're both women successful women you're both creators so andrew tay is an example of somebody that has become exceptionally successful at galvanizing public attention but he's also from any perspective a misogynist so let me ask a personal question do you think i should talk to him on this podcast how would you feel as a fan somebody i'm talking to the great alex and andrea botez and the next episode is with andrew che i think it's a double edged sword and most of these things are not as black and white as they seem you know because on one hand i don't agree with his beliefs and i think he said a lot of things that are very hurtful and that influence people's opinions at the same time talking to someone through that and trying to get to the root of it and how much of it he used just as a social media tactic to maybe change the opinion of people who have been so influenced by him towards something that is maybe more understanding towards women or things like that could do some good but at the same time platforming someone like that and giving them more attention also signals to other people who have a platform that it's okay so it's kinda weighing the pluses and the minuses and it's a very tough decision because it's not clear and the thing about the internet when you make the wrong decision you're gonna pay for it right that's the thing like personally and it it is it is funny like i think the whole way you rose to fame is just a growth hack and i've seen other people do it where like you just say kind of i don't honestly i don't really listen to his content because i just find it so dumb but i think he knows that by saying the dumbest most controversial things that's like a quick rise to fame and i think surface level like he can really hold it up but that's why i would honestly enjoy tuning into a conversation where you're really breaking down to the core of those beliefs and i think like the young kids who look up to him and when you actually hear someone challenging it could actually be helpful for people but at the same time it's a lot of bad publicity people see your podcast they see wow like they don't if they don't know you and they don't know why you're interviewing him and they don't listen they'll see that and then hundred percent think it's for the other reason but i'm also afraid of a society where you can't have discourse with people you don't dis with people you disagree with and even though i don't like andrew tate i think the fact that he got banned from all the platforms is kind of scary because it sets a precedent and you always have to ask yourself would this be ethical if i was on the other side and even things with a president like trump even if let's say you're somebody who was on the left if that would have happened to a leftist president how would you feel would you think that's morally ethical so that is something that i think is important we try to find ways to have conversations and reach some mutual understanding and try instead of just amplifying the worst about every human being well so one of the major reasons i'm struggling with is because i really enjoy talking to brilliant women i think it's also i've a lot of women reached out to me saying like it it is what it is but they're inspired when the female guest is on yeah and to me if i talk to somebody like andrew tate even if i have a really hard hitting i think it could be a very good conversation that lessens the likelihood that a brilliant powerful female will go on the show because they will never they'll never watch it but we the thing we do in this society is we put labels on each other well lex is the person that platforms misogynist yep i did a thing where joe rogan got in in trouble over an n word controversy earlier in the year and joe is a good friend of mine and i said that i stand with joe that he's not a racist or something like that and within certain communities i'm now somebody who's an apologist for racists right or a racist myself that kind of thing and we put labels without ever listening to the content without ever sort of actually just even the very simple step or it seems to be difficult of like taking on the best possible interpretation of what a person said and giving him the benefit of the doubt and having empathy for another person so you have to play in this field where people assign labels to each other and it's difficult but ultimately i believe i hope that good conversations is a way to like a greater understanding of for people to grow together as a society and improve and learn lessons the mistakes of the past but you also have to play this game where people just like putting labels on each other and canceling each other over those or that guy said one thing nice about donald trump he must be a far right nazi or or the opposite that this person says something nice about the vaccine he must be a far left whatever because apologies for whatever for fauci well most of us i think are ultimately in the middle it's it's a weird it's a weird thing but i think and it's also painful on a personal level like people people have written to me about things like single words half sentences that i've said about either putin or zelensky where they have hate towards me because of what i said either both directions i have now accumulated very passionate people that some call me a putin apologist some call me a zelensky apologist and it hurts to given how much i have family there how much i've seen of suffering there and to carry that burden over time and not let it destroy you is tough so like do you wanna take on another thing like that when you have conversations right or can i just talk to awesome people at youtube where it's not that boring we're not controversial it's or you're interesting fascinating you're inspiring you're like fun you know not all those difficult things that come with more difficult conversations right but somebody has to be making those difficult decisions and challenging the notions that we should cancel someone just for slightly disagreeing with us and it's very hard to take that on personally and i think that's a huge part of it when you know it's something you're doing for the right reasons and you're getting a lot of people coming and misinterpreting it it's very painful but i think you have to ask yourself long term if when you made that decision you ultimately thought it would be better or worse for your listeners to know that conversation and then if you can sleep with it at night take the risk yeah when actually when i talk to people that especially like astrophysicist and you realize how tiny we are right how incredible like how huge the universe is like you don't it doesn't matter you can do anything you could like you can walk around naked talk shit to people do whatever the hell and actually in modern social media people will just like forget it's like it's ultimately liberating just try to do at least from my perspective the best possible thing for the world you can take big risks it doesn't matter and that's the other thing with being canceled nowadays because everyone's attention is much more shortsighted you can get canceled and then it'll blow over in three days and you actually see things like this on twitch very often where people just have outbursts of outrage and they come into your chat and they're all spamming and saying mean things and then three days after and of course they're not actually ever serious things they're usually like things clipped of any streamers in like their worst moments but then people forget about it pretty soon after so you're able to accept that like when when somebody's being shitty to you for a day yeah i mean i still get sometimes emotional about it especially when i'm like oh wow like these things are are being said are not true or like this is clearly taken out of context but i've just accepted that it's part of the job and if i am trying my best and i am trying things with as good intentions as possible then i just try to learn every time that happens and be like okay what could i do better what is just part of the job well let's start some controversy who's the greatest chess player of all time is it magnus carlsen is it gary kasparov is it somebody else bobby fischer do you have a favorite alex so whenever i hear this question i interpret it in a very specific way where it's not who was the most talented chess player or who had the most impact on the chess world but who is the greatest at playing chess where if you were putting all of these players at their peak who would be the best and you know we're kind of living in a world where obviously humans are becoming more like cyborgs and their tools make them a lot more powerful yes and the computer is the most powerful tool for chess that we've ever witnessed and the top players now someone like magnus carlsen or garry kasparov if they were gonna go towards people like you know even lasker or bobby fischer back in the day lasker he was world champion for twenty seven years he was the best in his field by far but would he be able to stand up to someone like magnus carlsen who has had these tools i don't think so so most chess players have said garry kasparov and i think even magnus has said that in the past but i like to think of it as magnus in his peak and garry at his peak and because magnus was able to live more in a computer era i feel like so far he's the greatest of all time and some studies say things like how there's rating inflation but i looked into some of them and they basically calculated people's play in over the years and it seems that there hasn't been inflation people are just getting better and i think it's because you have better tools at chess and also like one of one of the cases what what's your what's your i was gonna say i actually i i disagree with that good make it interesting i think i would judge the greatest like greatest player of all time in relative to the time that they lived in in magnus although he is technically the strongest chess player in history that is because he had computers to study chess with and of course if you compare him to like garry kasparov he plays most like stockfish but garry kasparov at his time he beat more players of his skill level than magnus did and magnus loses more often he also of course held the belt for twenty years more so i'd say actually because gary lacked the help of computers to study chess and overall performed better against players of his skill level i think he would be number one nice yeah but i mean the case that people make for magnus on many i mean what alex said but but also magnus plays a lot and he doesn't he plays a lot blitz bullet and mhmm like he puts he gets drunk and like he's really putting himself out there and in all kinds of conditions and he's able to dominate in a lot of them we get to see many of the like losses or blunders and all that kind of stuff because he just puts himself out there and i think kasparov was much more like yeah i just don't know and he's very focused on world championship it was very like very limited number of games and very focused on winning and so there's some aspect to the versatility the aggressive play the fun the all of that that i think you have to give credit to oh hundred percent in terms of just the hue the the the scope the scale the variety of genius exhibited by magnus and he might not even be done yet i don't know if he'll ever hit twenty nine hundred but we can't judge yet because he's not at the peak of his career potentially what do you think about him not playing world championship isn't that like isn't that wild the entirety of the history twentieth century going like meh like let's walking away from this one tournament that's this seems to be at the center of chess what do you think about that decision i mean you can't help but be disappointed as a chess fan who wants to see the best player in the world defend his title but i also understand it on a personal level and not feeling as satisfied when you're going to the world championship and have having to defend against people who are less strong than you and also imagine winning world championships and not feeling a joy out of that yeah so maybe by not doing that and focusing instead on a goal like twenty nine hundred he'll be more likely to accomplish it because he's focusing on what actually motivates him to play chess but i do think that it will hurt how we judge the next world champion i think it won't change him being the best player in the world and for someone to replace him even let's say like nepo versus sting even if one of them win and right on some stance it does lower the merit because now who has the world chess championship title isn't actually the best player in the world and that has happened before in the past but still gonna take the same effort to prove when they would pass him like ten twenty years to become stronger than magnus so i don't think it changes the skill level that it takes to become the best chess player in the world i think for chess fans it's very disappointing but i think in the overall like grand scheme of like the public view to people who don't really so like you know what breaks the popular culture and you think of what names people know who don't play chess like bobby fischer did it most people know casper over magnus it takes the same ability and talent and that doesn't change i think it does change though if you're playing a player who's not as strong but i i see your point as well and i know we differ on this like i said i heard you ask magnus but what is your take on it well listen his answer is kinda brilliant which he's not saying he's he's bored of the world championship mhmm he's bored of a process that doesn't determine the best player mhmm like and it's too anxiety inducing to him to have a small number of games he he's he's he doesn't mind losing which is really fascinating mhmm to a better player right or somebody who is his level he's more anxious about losing to a weaker player the weaker player because of the small sample size now if like poker players had that anxiety they would never play at all right that's the world series of poker you you get to lose against weaker players all the time that's the throw all the dice but that's an interesting perspective that he would love to play twenty thirty forty games mhmm in the world championship but then he would enjoy it much more and also play shorter games because they emphasize the like pure chess actually being able to like you like much more variety in the middle game just to see a bunch of chaos and see how you're able to compute calculate and intuition all that kind of stuff and yeah that's beautiful i wish the chess world would step up and meet him in a place that makes sense you know change the world championship so if he did changing it somehow that a loss for that or having other really respected tournaments that become like an annual thing that step up to that or more kind of online youtube type of competitions which i think they're trying to do more and more like the crypto cup and all those kinds of things yeah and the grand tour the grand tour does play in which takes a lot of the top players and they do it online in shorter formats but there's you know and so that's his perspective my perhaps narrow perspective is i romanticize the olympic games and those are every four years and the and the world championships because they're rare because the sample size is so small that's where the magic happens everything's on the line for you know for people that spend their whole life twenty years of dedication everything you have every minute of the day is spent for that moment you know you think about like gymnastics at the olympic games there's certain sports where a single mistake and you're fucked and that stress that pressure it can it can it can break people or it can create magic like a person that's the underdog has the best night of their life or the person that's been dominating for years all of a sudden slips up and that that drama from a human perspective is beautiful so i still like the world championships but then again looking at all the draws looking at like well the the magic isn't quite there so to me when i see faster games of chess that's much more that's much more beautiful so but then i don't understand the game of chess deeply enough to know like does it have to be so so many draws like is there a way to create a more dynamic chess i mean he talked about random chess like with with a random starting position that's really interesting but then of course that that's like then you do have to play hundreds of games and that kind of stuff right so i i but i think it's great that the world number one is struggling with these questions because he's in the position he has the leverage to actually change the game of chess as it's publicly seen as it's publicly played so it's it's interesting he's he's still young enough to to dominate for quite a long time if he wants so i don't know i you know i with kasparov the the the the fight between nations i i hope they have the world championship and i hope there's a i hope he's still a part of it somehow i hope he changes his mind and comes back comes back some kind of dramatic thing i don't know but it is it is his heart is not in it and then and then that's not beautiful to see right yeah it it is beautiful that the thing he wants is a great game of chess against an opponent that's his level or better and that's that's great that he's coming from that place but i hope he comes back tomorrow because the the world championship is is a special thing in any sport so you do wish that the person who wins the world championship is the best player in the world no i hope that the best people in the world the two best people in the world are the ones that sit down but the person that wins is the person that that that's the magic of it nobody knows who's going to win i think magnus is so he he really wants the best person to win like the the that's why he wants the large sample size but to me there's some magic to it the the stress of it the the drama of it that's all part of the game like it's not just about the purity of the game like the the calculation the pure chess of it it's also like the drama like the yeah the the pressure the drama all of it the shit talking if it gets to you the mind games you know this is a part that's fun to watch but less fun to be playing there to be but that's why it's great who can melt who can rise under that pressure and and who melts under that pressure what there's a lot of people that look up to you like they're inspired by you because you've taken a kinda nonlinear path through life is there any advice you have for people like in high school today they're trying to figure out what they wanna do do they wanna go to stanford do they wanna pursue a career in i don't know in industry or or go kind of the path you guys have taken which is have the ability to do all of that and still choose to make the thing that you're passionate about your your life i always like the calculated risks approach where when you're younger it's okay to take more risks because you have a lot more time but there has to be a reason why you're doing that particular risk is it something that you've spent a lot of time already really passionate and working on or is it just something that's trendy and you wanna do it because you don't have a better option and that's actually similar to what andrea did when she decided to go into streaming instead of school yeah it was the reason i got into streaming because i was initially going to go to college but the pandemics it was right at the beginning of the pandemic and all my classes were online and i never thought ever since i was twelve like my dream was school and i saw myself nowhere else than going to university and i just i thought of it and kinda weighed out the risk i'm like well if i take a gap year and i try streaming with my sister what do i have to lose i gained some experience working with someone who has a lot more experience than i do and then i can go back to school after and if i go to school right now i do online classes for a year and that's something that i could do at any time so that's why it made a lot of sense for me to go into this but of course this is also a very unique opportunity so i don't know how applicable but i do think overall the calculated risk is a really good so life is like chess exactly maybe sometime exactly you're also have you considered a career in professional fighting i saw you did a self defense class you did a little jiu jitsu did you see the ten year old kid who throwing her threw her yes and apparently i could have broken a leg but it's actually funny like chess boxing is a thing and i have been doing a lot of boxing like i physical activity is like honestly one of my favorite things to do and i have been testing it out on content and we have a creator friend who's hosting a chess boxing tournament but there's no woman who's could match me unfortunately because all the opponents are male yeah and i can't fight a guy how does chess boxing work so you do a round of chess and a round of boxing and we actually did a training camp for it before and of course like after you go into the ring is this real this serious yes it's amazing london chess boxing club and like after you get like videos i thought it's something you just oh it's in russia or something no it's a real sport yeah it's a real sport yeah no it's very cool but after you get really tired you're more likely to make a mistake is there just a couple of chapters or something yeah there's probably good strategies like what do you want to like because some of it is is a cardio thing do you wanna work on your chest or your butt like they do both it's very fun but yeah from a content perspective i'm sure there's a lot of people that like and it's so very entertaining would love to see yep love to see i don't wanna see andrea getting hit that would be i would love to unless she doesn't get hit but i would get i met the dummy fought in a fight and she did end up winning but seeing her get hit i thought i was gonna throw off boxing so cool she had no experience in boxing whatsoever and then coming from someone in the content world where you start like waking up six days a week at six am and he's she's training every day like you know like a real professional athlete i think like it's such a unique experience and also like a really test of how much you can really commit to this and progress and i think that's really rewarding did you ever end up doing the marathon with david goggins that you're training no i got injured but we're gonna do it soon that's on my bucket list just to see where your limits are you're ready to go do leading up to this nothing gonna go into it it's mental anyway oh you know but i do run a lot to make sure like there's no like you know you have to be have a base level of fitness to make sure your body doesn't completely freak out mhmm but other than that you know fifty plus miles is just about like taking it one step at a time and just being able to deal with the suffering and all the voices the little voices that tell you all the excuses like why are you doing this this blister is bleeding whatever whatever the the thing that makes you want to stop just just shut it off sometimes it feels like you like pain no well uh-huh no no but the pain does seem to show the way to progress so what your turn in my in my world something that's really hard and i don't want to do that's usually the right thing to do and i i'm not saying that's a that's like a universal truth it's just you know if there's a few doors to go into the one that i want to go into least that's the one that usually is the right one afterwards i will learn something from it the david goggins thing i don't know that's listen i we're we're talking offline the different the conversation with liv she's a very numeric calculated risk mhmm everything is planned i i go with the heart i just i just go whatever the hell i think two years ago i woke up it was summer i i decided to tweet i will do as many push ups i don't know why i did this but i i will do as many push ups and pull ups as the sweetest likes something like that okay yeah right and then that it got like thirty thousand yeah once you put it out on the internet you're held accountable myself i mean it in some sense and then that's when i already was connected to david at that point but that's when he called me and then they have to do it and then i did it it was one of the hardest things i've ever done you take i got it i i did it for seven days and i got injured so i did about a few thousand so this is what got you to be injured this week this challenge no it's different i keep getting injured i keep getting injured doing some stuff but this particular thing i started doing the you don't realize that you have to really ramp up so i got like overuse injury tendinitis on on the shoulder all the way down to the elbow so i took like eight or nine days off and then started again and then it took about thirty one days to do thirty thousand i i the number was like twenty six twenty seven thousand yeah because and i it took like three four hours a day oh god yeah sounds like torture and not you know and the constantly asking myself what am i doing with my life this is why you're single was the voice of my head this this is what are you doing it's like face down on the carpet i like exhaust like what what because of a tweet what is this but do you record it or you just i did i did record it for myself okay now imagine doing this every day and that's what it's like to be a twitch streamer just kidding right i'm doing stupid things for combat now really important to me actually to not make it into content you know i recorded everything so maybe one day i could publish it i recorded it mostly because it's really hard to count yeah when you get exhausted yeah like i just so you actually enter the zen place where with push ups where it's just like it's almost like like breathing you get into a rhythm and you could do quite a lot but i wanted to make sure like if i actually get this done i want there to be evidence that i got it done for myself so i can count it i had this idea that i would use machine learning to like automatically process the video to count it but then like after like ten ten days i didn't even give a shit what anyone thought it was about me versus me i didn't even care lex versus lex yeah and then yeah and david was extremely supportive but that's when i realized like i i really want to go head to head with him yeah this those kinds of people are beautiful they really challenge you to your limits whatever that is it's like the thing is physical exercise is such an easy way to push yourself to your limit there's in all other walks of life it's it's trickier to configure like how do you push yourself to your limits in chess it's hard mhmm to figure out but like in physical think it's ever dangerous yeah and that's what that's why it's beautiful the danger you he likes to pay i don't like that your eyes lit up as i said yeah like if you don't know how you're gonna get out of it you're gonna have to figure out something profound it is the yourself with you and i mean one of the reasons i went to ukraine is i really wanted to experience the hardship and the intensity of war that people are experiencing so i can understand myself better i can understand them better so the words that are leaving my mouth are grounded in a better understanding of who they are and i mean the the running a lot with david goggins is is a much simpler thing to do simpler way to understand something about yourself about like the limits of human nature i think most growth happens with voluntary suffering or struggle mhmm involuntary self that's that's where the dark trauma is created but i don't know now maybe may maybe it is maybe i'm just attracted to and what is it that your mind does when you're going through this involuntary suffering i think it there's like stages first all the excuses start coming like why are you doing this and then you start to wonder like what what kind of person do you want to be so all the dreams you had all the promise you made to yourself and to others all the ambitions you had that are haven't come yet realized somehow that all becomes really intensely like visceral as as the struggle is happening and then when all of that is allowed to pass from your mind you have this clear appreciation of what you really love in life which is just like just living just the moment the like the step at a time like it's i think what meditation does and it's most effective it's just that pain is a and is a catalyst for the the meditative process i think for me that's for me i don't know magna said there's no meaning to life do you guys agree or no why are we here i do not know why we're here but i do know that having some kind of meaning that i give my own life makes it a lot more motivating every day so i just try to focus on finding meaning within my own life even if i know it's just self imposed and then chess is a part of that chess is a part of it maybe it was more so when i was younger because it was easier to just feel like i wanna improve as a person and to use chest to kind of measure some kind of self improvement and now it's more different than that and i think i need to once again find what that you know northern star is basically i need to have a why for why i'm doing things and then you i feel like i could do very hard things what role does love play in the human condition alex and andrea i'll let andrea start this one since i took the last sure and yeah just to add my answer for the last one i i also kind of think well life is meaningless but i like the stoic idea where that's something that you live to revolt against but for the second question the revolt against the fundamental meaninglessness of life i like it exactly yeah it was what does love play what role does love play yeah in the human condition the way i see it love is a reason you want to share experiences with other people that's how i see it like the people you really love you wanna share the things you're going through with them the good and the bad yeah exactly that's my simple take on love my take on it is that part of what it is to be human is to be somebody who feels things emotionally and love is one of the most intense feelings you can have obviously there's the opposite of that and there's things like hate but i think the love you feel for people like your parents and your friends and romantic love in that moment is much more intense than in other situations and i think it's also just very unique to humans and that's what i appreciate about it maybe that's the meaning of life maybe that's what the stoics are searching for andrea alex thank you so much for this and thank you for an
