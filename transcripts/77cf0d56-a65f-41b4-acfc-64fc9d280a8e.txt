the following is a debate on the topic of israel and palestine with norman filkenstein benny morris muinne reibani and steven bunnell also known online as destiny norm and benny are historians muinne is a middle east analyst and steven is a political commentator and streamer all four have spoken and debated extensively on this topic the goal for this debate was not for anyone to win or to score points it wasn't to get views or likes i never care about those and i think there are probably much easier ways to get those things if i did care the goal was to explore together the history present and future of israel and palestine in a free flowing conversation no time limits no rules there was a lot of tension in the room from the very beginning and it only got more intense as we went along and i quickly realized that this very conversation in a very real human way was a microcosm of the tensions and distance and perspectives on the topic of israel and palestine for some debates i will step in and moderate strictly to prevent emotion from boiling for this i saw the value in not interfering with the passion of the exchanges because that emotion in itself spoke volumes we did talk about the history and the future but the anger the frustration the biting wit and at times respect and camaraderie were all there like i said we did it in an perhaps all too human way i will do more debates and conversations on these difficult topics and i will continue to search for hope in the midst of death and destruction to search for our common humanity in the midst of division and hate this thing we have going on human civilization the whole of it is beautiful and it's worth figuring out how we can help it flourish together i love you all and now a quick few second mention of each

really interesting to think about the value of privacy the value of digital privacy in our lives how much we take for granted how much we look the other way when the product or whatever we're using is good enough and we become the product our data becomes the product it's really interesting i think transparency there is required because while it is true all of us value privacy we're very hypocritical on that point in many cases we distrust certain things that don't violate privacy that much and we trust blindly other things that violate a huge number of privacy or at least have the capacity to a lot of us use a smartphone with a camera looking at us always we trust that device human psychology is fascinating it worries me how easily we could be convinced at a mass scale by

israelis nineteen forty eight is the establishment of the state of israel and the war of independence for palestinians nineteen forty eight is a nakba which means catastrophe or the displacement of seven hundred thousand palestinians from their homes as a consequence of the war what to you is important to understand about the events of nineteen forty eight and the period around there forty seven forty nine that helps us understand what's going on today and maybe helps us understand the roots of all this that started even before nineteen forty eight i was hoping that norm could speak first then benny then wayne and then steve norm after world war two the british decide that they didn't want to deal with the palestine question anymore and the ball was thrown into the court of the united nations now as i read the record the un was not attempting to arbitrate or adjudicate rights and wrongs it was confronting a very practical problem there were two national communities in palestine and there were irreconcilable differences on fundamental questions most importantly looking at the historic record on the question of immigration and associate with the question of immigration the question of land the un special committee on palestine which came into being before the un one eight one partition resolution the un special committee it recommended two states in palestine there was a minority position represented by iran india yugoslavia they supported one state but they believed that if forced to the two communities would figure out some sort of modus vivendi and live together united nations general assembly supported partition between what it called a jewish state and an arab state now in my reading of the record they understand there's new scholarship in the subject which i've not read but so far as i've read the record there's no clarity on what the united nations general assembly meant by a jewish state and an arab state except for the fact that the jewish state would be demographically the the majority would be jewish and the arab state demographically would be arab the unscathed the un special committee on palestine it was very clear and it was reiterated many times that in recommending two states each state the arab state and the jewish state would have to guarantee full equality of all citizens with regard to political civil and religious matters now that does raise the question if there is absolute full equality of all citizens both in the jewish state and the arab state with regard to political rights civil rights and religious rights apart from the demographic majority it's very unclear what it meant to call a state jewish or call a state arab in my view the partition resolution was the correct decision i do not believe that the arab and jewish communities could at that point be made to live together i disagree with the minority position of india iran and yugoslavia and that not being a practical option two states was the only other option in this regard i would want to pay tribute to what was probably the most moving speech at the un general assembly proceedings by the soviet foreign minister romico i was very tempted to quote it at length but i recognized that would be taking too much time so i asked a young friend jamie sternwinder to edit it and just get the essence of what foreign minister gromyko had to say during the last war gromyko said the jewish people underwent exceptional sorrow and suffering without any exaggeration this sorrow and suffering are indescribable hundreds of thousands of jews are wandering about in various countries of europe in search of means of existence and in search of shelter the united nations cannot and must not regard this situation with indifference past experience particularly during the second world war shows that no western european state was able to provide adequate assistance for the jewish people in defending its rights and its very existence from the violence of the hitlerites and their allies this is an unpleasant fact but unfortunately like all other facts it must be admitted gromyko went on to say in principle he supports one state or the soviet union supports one state but he said if relations between the jewish and arab populations of palestine proved to be so bad that it would be impossible to reconcile them and to ensure the peaceful coexistence of the arabs and the jews the soviet union would support two states i personally am not convinced that the two states would have been unsustainable in the long term if and this is a big if the zionist movement had been faithful to the position it proclaimed during the unscathed public hearings at the time ben gurion testified quote i want to express what we mean by a jewish state we mean by a jewish state simply a state where the majority of the people are jews not a state where a jew has in any way any privilege more than anyone else a jewish state means a state based on absolute equality of all her citizens and on democracy alas this was not to be as professor morris has written quote zionist ideology and practice were necessarily and elementally expansionist and then he wrote in another book transfer the euphemism for expulsion transfer was inevitable and inbuilt into zionism because it sought to transform a land which was arab into a jewish state and a jewish state could not have arisen without a major displacement of arab population and because this aim automatically produced resistance among the arabs which in turn persuade the yeshiv's leaders the yeshiv being the jewish community the yeshiv's leaders that a hostile arab majority or a large minority could not remain in place if a jewish state was to arise or safely endure or as professor morris retrospectively put it quote a removing of a population was needed without a population expulsion a jewish state would not have been established unquote the arab side rejected outright the partition resolution i won't play games with that i know a lot of people try to prove it's not true it clearly in my view is true the arab side rejected outright the partition resolution while israeli leaders acting under compulsions inevitable and inbuilt into zionism found the pretext in the course of the first arab israeli war to expel the indigenous population and expand its borders i therefore conclude that neither side was committed to the letter of the partition resolution and both sides aborted it thank you norm norm asked that you make a lengthy statement in the beginning benny i hope it's okay to call everybody by their first name in the name of camaraderie norm has quoted several things you said perhaps you can comment broadly on the question of nineteen forty eight and maybe respond to the things that noor said yeah unscop the united nations special committee on palestine recommended partition the majority of unscop recommended partition which was accepted by the un general assembly in november nineteen forty seven essentially looking back to the peel commission in nineteen thirty seven ten years earlier a british commission had looked at the problem of palestine the two warring national groups who refused to live together if you like or consolidate a unitary state between them and peel said there should be two states that's the principle the country must be partitioned into two states this would give a modicum of justice to both sides if not all their demands of course and the united nations followed suit the united nations unscop and then the un general assembly representing the will of the international community said two states is the just solution in this complex situation the problem was that immediately with the passage of the resolution the arabs the arab states and the arabs of palestine said no as norman finkelstein said they said no they rejected the partition idea the principle of partition not just the idea of what percentage which side should get but the principle of partition they said no to the jews should not have any part of palestine for their sovereign territory maybe jews could live as a minority in palestine that also was problematic in the eyes of the palestinian arab leadership husseini had said only jews who were there before nineteen seventeen could actually get citizenship and continue to live there but the arabs rejected partition and the arabs of palestine launched in a very disorganized fashion war against the resolution against the implementation of the resolution against the jewish community in palestine and this was their defeat in that civil war between the two communities while the british were withdrawing from palestine led to the arab invasion the invasion by the arab states in may nineteen forty eight of of the country again basically with the idea of eradicating or preventing the emergence of a jewish state in line with the united nations decision and the will of the international community norman said that the zionist enterprise and he quoted me meant from the beginning to transfer or expel the arabs of palestine or some of the arabs of palestine and i think he's sort of quoting out of context the context in which the statements were made that the jewish state could only emerge if there was a transfer of arab population was preceded in the way i wrote it and the way it actually happened by arab resistance and hostilities towards the jewish community had the arabs accepted partition there would have been a large arab minority in the jewish state which emerged in 'forty eight 'forty seven and in fact jewish economists and state builders took into account that there would be a large arab minority and its needs would be cared for etcetera but this was not to be because the arabs attacked and had they not attacked perhaps a jewish state with a large arab minority could have emerged but this didn't happen they went to war the jews resisted and in the course of that war arab populations were driven out some were expelled some left because arab leaders advised them to leave or ordered them to leave and at the end of the war israel said they can't return because they just tried to destroy the jewish state and that's the basic reality of what happened in 'forty eight the jews created a state the palestinian arabs never bothered to even try to create a state before forty eight and in the course of the nineteen forty eight war and for that reason they have no state to this day the jews do have a state because they prepared to establish a state fought for it and established it hopefully lastingly when you said hostility in case people are not familiar there was a full on war where arab states invaded and israel won that war let me just add to clarify the war had two parts to it the first part was the arab community in palestine its militiamen attacked the jews from november nineteen forty seven in other words from the day after the un partition resolution was passed arab gunmen were busy shooting up jews and that snowballed into a full scale civil war between the two communities in palestine in may nineteen forty eight a second stage began in the war in which the arab states invaded the new state attacked the new state and and they too were defeated and thus a state of israel emerged in the course of this two stage war a vast palestinian refugee problem occurred and so after that the transfer the expulsion the the thing that people call the nakba happened william could you speak to nineteen forty eight and the historical significance of it sure there's there's a lot to unpack here i'll try to limit myself to just a few points regarding zionism and transfer i think haim weizmann the head of the world zionist organization had it exactly right when he said that the objective of zionism is to make palestine as jewish as england is english or france is french in other words as as norman explained a jewish state requires jewish political demographic and territorial supremacy without those three elements the state would be jewish in name only and i think what distinguishes zionism is its insistence supremacy and exclusivity that would be my first point the second point is i think what the soviet foreign minister at the time andrei gromyko said is exactly right with one reservation grumiko was describing a european savagery unleashed against europe's jews at the time you know it wasn't palestinians or arabs the savages and the barbarians were european to the core it had nothing to do with developments in palestine or the middle east secondly at the time that gromyka was speaking those jewish survivors of the holocaust and and others who were in need of safe haven were still overwhelmingly on the european continent and not on palestine not in palestine and i think given the scale of the savagery i don't think that any one state or country should have borne responsibility for addressing this crisis i think it should have been an international responsibility soviet union could have contributed germany certainly could and should have contributed the united kingdom and the united states which slammed their doors shut to the persecuted jews of europe as the nazis were rising to power they certainly should have played a role but instead what passed for the international community at the time decided to partition palestine and here i think we need to judge the partition resolution against the realities that obtained at the time two two thirds of the population of palestine was arab the yeshuf the jewish community in palestine constituted about one third of the total population and controlled even less of of of the land within palestine as as a preeminent palestinian historian waleed al khalidi has pointed out the partition resolution in giving roughly fifty five percent of palestine to the jewish community and i think forty one forty two percent to the arab community to the palestinians did not preserve the position of each community or even favor one community at the expense of the others rather it thoroughly inverted and revolutionized the relationship between between the two communities and as many have written the nakba was the inevitable consequence of partition given the nature of zionism given the territorial disposition given the weakness of the palestinian community whose leadership had been largely decimated during a major revolt at the end of the 1930s given that the arab states were still very much under french and british influence the nakba was inevitable the inevitable product of the partition resolution and and one last point also about the the un's partition resolution is yes formally that is what the international community decided on the twenty ninth of november nineteen forty seven it's not a resolution that could ever have gotten through the un general assembly today for a very simple reason it was a very different general assembly most african most asian states were not yet independent were the resolution to be placed before the international community today and i find it telling that the minority opinion was led by india iran and yugoslavia i think they would have represented the clear majority so partition given what we know about zionism given that it was entirely predictable what would happen given the realities on the ground in palestine was deeply unjust and the idea that either the palestinians or the arab states could have accepted such a resolution is is i think an illusion that was in nineteen forty seven we saw what happened in 'forty eight and 'forty nine palestinian society was essentially destroyed over eighty percent i believe of palestinians resident in the territory that became the state of israel were either expelled or fled and ultimately were ethnically cleansed because ethnic cleansing consists of two components it's not just forcing people into refuge or expelling them it's just as importantly preventing their return and here and and and benny morris has written i think an article about yosef weitz and the transfer committees there was a very detailed initiative to prevent the return and it consisted of raising hundreds of palestinian villages to the ground which was systematically implemented and so on and so palestinians became a stateless people now what is the most important reason that no arab state was established in palestine well since the nineteen thirties the zionist leadership and the hashemite leadership of jordan as it's been thoroughly researched and written about by the israeli british historian avi islam essentially colluded to prevent the establishment of an independent arab state in palestine there's there's much more here but i think those those are the key points i i would make about nineteen forty eight we may talk about zionism britain un assemblies and all all the things you mentioned there's a lot to dig into so again if we can keep it to just one statement moving forward sure after steven if you wanna go a little longer also we should acknowledge the fact that the speaking speeds of of people here are different steven speaks about ten times faster than me steven do you wanna comment on nineteen forty eight yeah i think it's interesting where people choose to start the history i noticed a lot of people like to start at either forty seven or forty eight because it's the first time where they can clearly point to a catastrophe that occurs on the arab side that they want to ascribe one hundred percent of the blame to the newly emergent israeli state to but i feel like when you have this type of reading of history it feels like the goal is to moralize everything first and then to pick and choose facts that kind of support the statements of your initial moral statement afterwards whenever people are talking about forty eight or the establishment of the arab state i never hear about the fact that a civil war started in forty seven that was largely instigated because of the arab rejectionism of the forty seven partition plan i never hear about the fact that the majority of the land that was acquired happened by purchases from jewish organizations of palestinian arabs of the ottoman empire before the mandatory period in nineteen twenty even started funnily enough king abdullah of jordan was quoted as saying the arabs are as prodigal in selling their land as they are in weeping about it i never hear about the multiple times that arabs rejected partition partition rejected living with jews rejected any sort of state that would have even had any sort of jewish exclusivity it's funny because it was brought up before that the partition plan was unfair and that's why the arabs rejected it as though they rejected it because it was unfair because of the amount of land that jews were given and not just due to the fact that jews were given land at all as though a thirty percent partition or a twenty five percent partition would have been accepted but i don't think that was the reality of the circumstances i feel like most of the other stuff has been said but i i noticed that whenever people talk about forty eight or the years preceding forty eight i think the worst thing that happens is there's a there's a cherry picking of the facts where basically all of the blame is ascribed to this this built in idea of zionism that because of a handful of quotes or because of an ideology we can say that transfer or population expulsion or the the basically the mandate of all of these arabs being kicked off the land was always going to happen when i think there's a refusal sometimes as well to acknowledge that regardless of the ideas of some of the zionist leaders there is a political social and military reality on the ground that they're forced to contend with and unfortunately the arabs because of their inability to engage in diplomacy and only to use tools of war to try to negotiate everything going on in palestine basically always gave the jews a reason or an excuse to fight and acquire land through that way because of their refusal to negotiate on anything else whether it was the partition plan in forty seven whether it was the the hussein peace conference afterwards where israel even offered to annex gaza in in fifty one where they offered to take in a hundred thousand refugees every single deal is just projected out of hand because the arabs don't want a jewish state anywhere in this region of the world i would like to engage professor morris if you don't mind i'm not with the first name it's just not my okay way of relating you can just call me morris you don't need the professor okay there's a real problem here and it's been a problem i've had over many years of reading your work apart perhaps from a grandchild i suspect nobody knows your work better than i do i've read it many times not once not twice at least three times everything you've written and the problem is it's a kind of quicksilver it's very hard to grasp a point and hold you to it so we're gonna try here to see whether we can hold you to a point and then you argue with me the point i have no problem with that your name please stephen bunnell okay mr bunnell referred to cherry picking and handful of quotes now it's true that when you wrote your first book on the palestinian refugee question four pages day before you know i'm not gonna quarrel my memory is not clear book four pages maybe four you know i'm not gonna quarrel my memory is not clear we're talking about forty years ago i read it i read it but then i read other things by you okay and you were taken to task if my memory is correct that you haven't adequately documented the claims of transfer let me allow me to finish and i thought that was a reasonable challenge because it was an unusual claim for a mainstream israeli historian to say as you did in that first book that from the very beginning transfer figured prominently in zionist thinking that wasn't unusual if you read anita shapira you read shabti tevit that was an unusual acknowledgment by you and then i found it very impressive that in that revised version of your first book you devoted twenty five pages to copiously documenting the salience of transfer in zionist thinking and in fact you used a very provocative and resonant phrase you said that transfer was inevitable and in built into zionism we're not talking about circumstantial factors a war arab hostility you said it's inevitable and inbuilt into zionism now as i said so we won't be accused of cherry picking those were twenty five very densely argued pages and then in an interview and i could cite several quotes but i'll choose one you said removing a population was needed let's look at the words without a population expulsion a jewish state would not have been established now you were the one again i was very surprised when i read your book here i'm referring to righteous victims i was very surprised when i came to that page thirty seven where you wrote that territorial displacement and dispossession was the chi chief motor of arab resistance to zionism territorial displacement and dispossession were the chief motor of arab resistance to zionism so you then went on to say because the arab population feared territorial displacement and dispossession it of course opposed zionism that's as normal as native americans opposing the euro american manifest destiny in the history of our own country because they understood it would be at their expense it was inbuilt and inevitable and so now for you to come along and say that it all happened just because of the war that otherwise the zionist made all these plans for a happy minority to live there that simply does not gel it does not cohere it is not reconcilable with what you yourself have written it was inevitable and inbuilt now in other situations you've said that's true but i think it was a greater good to establish a jewish state at the expense of the indigenous population that's another kind of argument that was theodore roosevelt's argument in our own country he said we don't want the whole of north america to remain a squalid refuge for these wigwams and teepees we have to get rid of them and make this a great country but he didn't deny that it was inbuilt and inevitable first i'll take up something that muin said he said that the nakba was inevitable as have you and predictable no no no i've never said that it was inevitable and predictable only because the arabs assaulted the jewish community and state in nineteen forty seven forty eight had there been no assault there probably wouldn't have been a refugee problem there's no reason for a refugee problem to have occurred expulsions to have occurred a dispossession massive dispossession to occur these occurred as a result of war now norman has said that i said that transfer was inbuilt into zionism in one way or another and this is certainly true in order to buy land they had the jews bought tracts of land on which some arabs sometimes lived sometimes they bought tracts of land on which there weren't arab villages but sometimes they bought land on which there were arabs and according to ottoman law and the british at least in the initial years of the the british mandate the law said that the peep people who bought the land could do what they liked with the people who didn't own the land who were basically squatting on the land which is the arab tenant farmers which is we're talking about a very small number actually of arabs who were displaced as a result of land purchases in the ottoman period or the mandate period but there was dispossession in one way they didn't possess the land they didn't own it but they were removed from the land and this did happen in zionism and there's if you like an inevitability in zionist ideology of buying tracts of land and starting to work it yourself and and settle it with your own people and so on that made sense but what we're really talking about is what happened in forty seven forty eight and in forty seven forty eight the arabs started a war and actually people pay for their mistakes and the palestinians have never actually agreed to pay for their mistakes they make mistakes they attack they suffer as a result and we see something similar going on today in in the gaza strip they do something terrible they kill twelve hundred jews they abduct two hundred and fifty women and children and babies and old people and whatever and then they start screaming please save us from what we did because the jews are counter attacking and this is what happened then and this is what's happening now it it there's something fairly similar in the situation here expulsion and this is important norman you should pay attention to this you didn't raise that expulsion transfer whenever policy of the zionist movement before forty seven it doesn't exist in zionist platforms of the various political parties of the zionist organization of the israeli state of the jewish agency nobody would have actually made it into policy because it was always a large minority if there were people who wanted it always a large minority of jewish politicians and leaders would have said no this is immoral we cannot start a state on the basis of an expulsion so so it was never adopted and actually was never adopted as policy even in forty eight even though ben gurion wanted as few arabs in the course of the war staying in the jewish state after they attacked it he didn't want disloyal citizens staying there because they wouldn't have been loyal citizens but this made sense in the war itself but the movement itself and its political parties never accepted it it's true that in nineteen thirty seven when the british as part of the proposal by the peel commission to divide the country into two states one arab one jewish which the arabs of course rejected a pill also recommended that the arabs most of the arabs in the jewish state to be should be transferred because otherwise if they stayed and were disloyal to the emerging jewish state this would cause endless disturbances warfare killing and so on so ben gurion and weizmann latched onto this proposal by the famous democracy in the world the british democracy when they proposed the idea of transfer side by side with the idea of partition because it made sense and they said well if the british say so we should also advocate it but they never actually tried to pass it as zionist policy and they fairly quickly stopped even talking about transfer after nineteen thirty eight so just to clarify what you're saying is that forty seven was an offensive war not a defensive war by the arabs yes by the arabs yep and you're also saying that there was never a top down policy of expulsion yes just to clarify the the point if i understood you correctly you're making you're making the claim that transfer expulsion and so on was was in fact a very localized phenomenon resulting resulting from individual land purchases and that if i understand you correctly you're also also making the claim that the idea that a jewish state requires a removal or overwhelming reduction of the non jewish population was if the arabs are attacking you yes but but that let's say prior to nineteen forty seven it would be your claim that the idea that a significant reduction or wholesale removal of the arab population was not part of of zionist thinking well i i think there's two problems with that i think what you're saying about localized disputes is correct but i also think that there is a whole literature that demonstrates that transfer was envisioned by zydus leaders on a much broader scale than simply individual land purchases in other words it's it it went way beyond we need to remove these tenants so that we can form this land the idea was we can't have a state where all these arabs remain and we have to get rid of them and the second i think impediment to to that view is that long before the un general assembly convened to address the question of palestine palestinian and arab and other leaders as well had been warning ad infinitum that the purpose of the zionist movement is not just to establish a jewish state but to establish an exclusivist jewish state and that transfer force displacement was fundamental to that project and just responding to sorry was it that steven bonnell or doug bonnell yeah with a b yeah yeah you made the point that the problem here is that people don't recognize is that the first and last result for the arabs is always war i think there's a problem with that i think you might do well to recall the nineteen thirty six general strike conducted by palestinians at the beginning of the revolt which at the time was the longest recorded general strike in history you may want to consult the book published last year by lori allen a history of false hope which discusses in great detail the consistent engagement by palestinians their leaders their elites their diplomats and so on with all these international committees if we look at today the palestinians are once again going to the international court of justice they're consistently trying to persuade the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court to do his job they have launched widespread boycott campaigns so of course the palestinians have engaged in military resistance but i think the suggestion that this has always been their first and last resort and that they have somehow spurned civic action spurned diplomacy i i think really has no basis in reality i'll respond to that and then a question for norm to take into account i think when he answers bennett because i am curious obviously i have fresher eyes on this and i'm a newcomer to this arena versus the three of you guys for sure a claim that gets brought up a lot has to do with the inevitability of transfer in zionism or the idea that as soon as the jews envisioned a state in palestine they knew that it would involve some mass transfer of population perhaps a mass expulsion i'm sure we'll talk about plan ballot or plan d at some point the issue that i run into is while you can find quotes from leaders while you can find maybe desires expressed in diaries i feel like it's hard to truly ever know if there would have been mass transfer in the face of arab peace because i feel like every time there was a huge deal on the table that would have had a sizable jewish arabs would reject it out of hand so for instance when we say that transfer was inevitable when we say that zionists would have never accepted you know a sizable arab population how do you explain the acceptance of the forty seven partition plan that would have had a huge arab population living in the jewish state is your contention that after the acceptance of that after the establishment of that state that jews would have slowly started to expel all of these arab citizens from their country or how do you explain that in lusan a couple years later that israel was willing to formally annex the gaza strip and make two hundred thousand or so people those citizens but i but i'm i'm just curious how how do we get this idea of zionism always means mass transfer when there were times at least early on in the history of israel and and a little bit before it where israel would have accepted a state that would have had a massive arab population in it is your yeah is your idea that they would have just slowly expelled them afterwards or is that question to me or norm either one i'm just curious for the incorporation of the answer yeah there's some misunderstandings here so let's try to clarify that number one it was the old historians who would point to the fact in professor morris's terminology the old historians were he called not real historians he called them chroniclers not real historians it was the old israeli historians who denied the centrality of transfer in zionist thinking it was then professor morris who contrary to israel's historic historian establishment who said now you remind me it's four pages but it came at the end of the book it was no no it's at the beginning of the book book transfer yes transfer is dealt with in four pages at the beginning of my first book on the balance of a refugee problem it's a fault of my memory but the point still stands it was professor morris who introduced this idea in what you might call a big way yeah but i didn't say everything is essential to the zion okay zion's the experimental a lot you know about you're saying centrality okay i never said it was central i said it was there okay the idea it's by the way it's okay to respond back and forth this is great and also just a quick question if if i may mhmm you're using quotes from from benny from professor morris it's also okay to say those quotes do not reflect the full context of the no way so like if we go back if you know to quotes we've said in the past and you both here have written the three you have written on this topic a lot is we should be careful and just admit like well yeah well that's not real quick just to be clear though the contention is that norm is quoting a part and saying that this was the entire reason for this whereas benny is saying it's a part of the i'm not quoting a part i'm quoting twenty five pages where professor morris was at great pains to document the claim that appeared in those early four pages of his book now you say it never became part of the official zionist platform it never became part of policy fine yeah yeah no i'm afraid yeah okay but but but we're also asked well this is true why did that happen why did that happen it's because it's a very simple fact which everybody understands ideology doesn't operate in a vacuum there are real world practical problems you can't just take an ideology and superimpose it on a political reality and turn it into a fact it was the british mandate there was significant arab resistance to zionism and that resistance was based on the fact as you said the fear of territorial displacement and this possession so you couldn't very well expect the zionist movement to come out in neon lights and announce hey we're going to be expelling you the first chance we get k k k that's not realistic no let let me respond look you say you've said it a number of times mhmm that the arabs from fairly early on in the in the conflict from the eighteen nineties or the early nineteen hundreds said the jews intend to expel us this doesn't mean that it's true it means that some arabs said this maybe believing it was true maybe using it as a political instrument to gain support to mobilize arabs against the zionist experiment but the fact is transfer did not occur before nineteen forty seven and arabs later said and then and since then have said that the jews want to build a third temple on the temple mount as if that's what really the the mainstream of zionism has always wanted and always strived for but this is nonsense it's something that husseini used to use as a way to mobilize masses for the cause using religion as as the way to get them to to join join him the fact that arabs said that their the the zionist want to dis dispossess us doesn't mean it's true it just means that there's some arabs thought that maybe and maybe said it sincerely and maybe insincerely professor morris later it became a self fulfilling prophecy this is true professor morris arabs attacked the jews professor morris i read through your stuff even yesterday i was looking through righteous victim you should read other things you're wasting your time no no actually no i do read other things but i don't consider it a waste of time to read you not at all you say that this wasn't inherent in zionism now would you agree that ben gurr david ben gurion was a zionist a zine an major zionist leader right would you agree chaim weizmann was a zionist yeah okay i believe they were i believe they took their ideology seriously it was the first generation just like with the bolsheviks the first generation was committed to an idea by the nineteen thirties it was just pure realpolitik the ideology went out the window the first generation i have no doubt about their convictions okay they were zionists transfer was inevitable and inbuilt in zionism he keeps repeating the tapes because i have as i said denny mister morris i have a problem reconciling here i read it's deeply entrenched two very resonant words inevitable and inbuilt deeply entrenched i never wrote well sure it's something you've just invented okay but but inevitable and inbuilt the idea okay let me concede fine let me concede something no the idea of transfer was there israel zangville a british zionist talked about it early on in the century even herzl in some way talked about transferring twenty five relation twenty your twenty five pages everybody talked about it we keep bringing up this line from the twenty five page and the four pages you know we're lucky to have benny in front of us right now we don't need to go to the quotes like we can legitimately ask how central is expulsion to zionism in its early version of zionism and what whatever zionism is today and how much power influence does zionism and ideology have in israel and the like influence the the philosophy the ideology of zionism have on israel today the zionist movement up to nineteen forty eight zionist ideology was central to the the whole zionist experience the whole enterprise up to nineteen forty eight and i think zionist ideology was also important in the first decades of israel's existence slowly the the the hold of zionism like if you like like like bolshevism held the soviet union gradually faded and a lot of israelis today think in terms of individual success and then the capitalism and all all sorts of things which have nothing to do with zionism but zionism was very important but what i'm saying is that the idea of transfer wasn't the core of zionism the idea of zionism was to save the jews who had been vastly persecuted in eastern europe and incidentally in the arab world the muslim world for centuries and eventually ending up with the holocaust the idea of zionism was to save the jewish people by establishing a state or reestablishing a jewish state on the ancient jewish homeland which is something the arabs today even deny that there were jews in palestine or the land of israel two thousand years ago arafat famously said what temple was there on temple mount maybe it was in nablus which of course is nonsense but but they had a connect strong connection for thousands of years to the land to which they wanted to return and return there they found that on the land lived hundreds of thousands of arabs and the question was how to accommodate the vision of a jewish state in palestine alongside the existence of these arab masses living on were indigenous in fact to the land by that stage and the idea of partition because they couldn't live together because the arabs didn't want to live together with the jews and i think the jews also didn't want to live together in one state with arabs in general the idea of partition was the thing which the zionists accepted okay we can we can only get a small part of palestine the arabs will get in thirty seven most of palestine in nineteen forty seven the the ratios were changed but we can we can live side by side with each other in a partition palestine and this was the essence of it the idea of transfer was there but it was never adopted by as policy but in nineteen forty seven forty eight the arabs attacked trying to destroy essentially the jewish the zionist enterprise and the emerging jewish state and the reaction was transfer in some way not as policy but this is what happened on the battlefield and this is also what ben gurion at some point began to want as well right well you know one of the first books on this issue i read when i was still in high school because my my late father had it was the diaries of theodor herzl and i think you know theodor herzl of course was was the founder of of the contemporary zionist movement and i think if you you read that it's very clear for herzl the model upon which the zionist movement would would proceed his model was cecil rhodes his i think you know rhodes from what i recall correct me if i'm wrong has quite a prominent place in herzl's diaries i think herzl was also corresponding with him and seeking his support cecil rhodes of course was was the british colonialist after whom the former white minority regime in in rhodesia was named and herzl also says explicitly in his diaries that it is essential to remove the existing population from palestine can i respond to this quite quickly in a moment please he says we shall have to spirit the penniless population across the borders and procure employment for them elsewhere a a people a a land without a people i'll continue but i'll but please go ahead just to this there is one small diary entry in herzl's vast five volumes yeah five volumes there's one paragraph which actually mentions the idea of transfer there are people who i think that herzl was actually pointing to south america when he was talking about that the jews were going to move to argentina and then they would try and buy out or buy off or spirit the penniless natives to make way for jewish settlement maybe he wasn't even talking about the arabs in that particular passage that's the argument of some people maybe he was but the point is it it has only a one hundredth of a one percent of the diary which is devoted to the subject it's not a central idea in in herzl in herzl's thinking what herzl wanted and this is what's important not rhodes i don't think he was the model herzl wanted to create a liberal democratic western state in palestine for the jews that's that was the idea not some imperial enterprise serving some imperial master which is what rhodes was about but to have a jewish state which was modeled on the western democracies in in palestine and this incidentally was more or less what weizmann and ben gurion ben gurion wanted they ben gurion was more of a socialist weizmann was more of a liberal westerner but they wanted to establish a social democratic or liberal state in palestine and they both envisioned through most of the years of their act activity that there would be an arab minority in that jewish state it's true that ben gurion strived to have as small as possible an arab minority in the jewish state because he knew that if you want a jewish majority state that that would be necessary but it's not something which they were willing to translate into actual policy just a quick pause to to mention that for people who are not familiar either herzl we're talking about over a century ago and everything we've been talking about has been mostly nineteen forty eight and before yes just one clarification on herzl's diaries i mean the other thing that i recall from those diaries is he was he was very preoccupied with in fact getting great power patronage seeing palestine the jewish state in palestine i think his words an outpost of civilization against barbarism yes in other words very much seeing his project as a proxy as a proxy for western imperialism in the middle east the right word not proxy he wanted to establish a jewish state which would be independent to get that he hoped that he would be be able to garner support from major imperial powers including the including the ottoman sultan yes who he tried to cultivate i just want to respond to a point you made earlier which was that people expressed their rejection of the partition resolution on the grounds that it gave the majority of the of palestine to the jewish community which formed only a third whereas in fact if i understood you correctly you're saying the palestinians and the arabs would have rejected any partition resolution yeah i i think a couple of things the one they would have rejected any two a lot of that land given was in the negev it was pretty terrible land at the time and then three the land that would have been partitioned to jews i think would have been i think i saw it was like five hundred thousand it would have been five hundred thousand jews four hundred thousand arabs and i think like eighty thousand bedouin would have been there so the the state would have been divided by fifty five i think you raise a valid point because i think the palestinians did reject the partition of their homeland in principle and i think the fact that the united nations general assembly then awarded the majority of their homeland to the zionist movement only added insult to injury i mean one doesn't have to sympathize with the palestinians to recognize that they have now been a stateless people for seventy five years can you name any country yours for example or yours that would be prepared to give fifty five percent twenty five percent ten percent of your country to the palestinians of course not and so the issue was not the existence of jews in palestine they had been there for centuries and of course they had ties to palestine and particularly to jerusalem and and other places going back centuries if not millennia but the idea of establishing an exclusively jewish state at the expense of those who are already living there i think it was right to reject that and i don't think we can look back now seventy five years later and say well you should have accepted losing fifty five percent of your home land because you ended up losing seventy eight percent of it in the addition and the remaining twenty two percent was occupied in nineteen sixty seven that's that's not how things work yeah and i can i can imagine i can imagine an american rejecting giving ten percent of the united states to the palestinians and if that rejection leads to war and you lose half your country i doubt that fifty years from now you're going to say well maybe i should have accepted that sure so i like this answer more than what i usually feel like i'm hearing when it comes to the palestinian rejection of the forty separate petition plan because sometimes i feel like a weird switch happens to where the arabs in the area are actually presented as entirely pragmatic people who are simply doing a calculation and saying like well we're losing fifty five percent of our land jews are only maybe one third of the people here and we've got forty five and no the math doesn't work basically but it wasn't a math problem i think like you said it was a matter of principle it was an ideology problem no it was a matter of principle yeah ideologically driven that that they as a as a people have a right to or are entitled to this land that they've never actually had an independent state on that they've never had even a guarantee of an independent state on that they've never actually ruled a government on last point is actually not correct because for all its injustice the mandate system recognized palestine as a class a mandate which provisionally recognized the independence of of that territory of what would emerge from that territory but not the palestinian it was provisionally recognized but not but the the territory itself was but not of the palestinian people to have a right or a guarantee to a government that would have reversed it the british mandate of palestine not the british mandate of israel the word exclusive which you keep using yes is nonsense the state which ben gurion envisioned would be a jewish majority state as they accepted the nineteen forty seven partition resolution as stephen said that included four hundred thousand plus arabs in a state which would have five hundred thousand jews so the idea of exclusivity wasn't anywhere in the air at all among the zionist leaders i think it was true in forty seven forty eight they wanted a jewish majority state but were willing to accept a state which had forty percent arabs that's one point the second thing is the palestinians may have regarded the land of palestine as their homeland but so did the jews it was the homeland of the jews as well the problem was the arabs were unable and remain to this day unable to recognize that for the jews that is their homeland as well and the problem then is how do you share this homeland either with one binational state or separate partitioned into two states the problem is that the arabs have always rejected both of these ideas that homeland belongs to the jews as jews feel as much as it does i think i would say for the zionist than for the arabs jews i would say for the jews it's the jewish people i would also homeland real quick i just want for both of you guys because i haven't heard these questions answered i really want these questions to be i'm just so curious how to make sense of them it was correctly brought up that i believe that ben gurion had i think shlomo ben amin describes it as an obsession with getting validation or support from western states great britain and then a couple decades later that explains us who has war yeah this crisis exactly correct that was one of the major motivators the idea to work with britain and france on a military operation the suez stage but then the question again i go back to if that is true if ben gurion if the early israel saw themselves as a western fashion nation how could we possibly that destroyed their legitimacy in the eyes of the entire western world would there not have been how not well first of all i think that that zionist leadership's acceptance of the partition resolution and and i think you may have written about this that they accepted it because it provided international endorsements of the the legitimacy of the principle of jewish statehood and they didn't accept the borders and in fact later expanded the borders second of all the the borders the borders were expanded at war they accepted the un partition resolution borders and all they they accepted they accepted the you can say that some of the zionists deep in their hearts had the the idea that maybe at some point including their most able to get more including their most senior leaders who said so i think you've quoted them say grudgingly accepted what the united nations the world community had said this is what you're going to get and and second of all i mean removing dark people darker people it's it's it's intrinsic it's intrinsic it's intrinsic to western history so the idea that americans or brits or the french would have an issue with i mean the french had been doing it in algeria for decades the americans have been doing it in north america for centuries so how would israel forcibly displacing palestinians somehow besmirch israel in the eyes of the west in the nineteen forty four resolution of the labour party and and at the time even bertrand russell was a member of the labour party it endorsed transfer of arabs out of palestine as muwins pointed out that was a deeply entrenched idea in western thinking that there was nothing it doesn't in any way contradict or violate or breach any moral values to displace the palestinian population now i do believe there's a legitimate question had it been the case as you said professor morris that the zionist wanted to create a happy state with a jewish majority but a large jewish minority and if by virtue of immigration like in our own country in our own country given the current trajectories nonwhites will become the majority population in our the united states quite soon and according to democratic principles we have to accept that so if that were the case i would say maybe there's an argument that had there been mass jewish immigration change the demographic balance in palestine and therefore jews became the majority you can make an argument in the abstract that the indigenous arab population should have been accepting of that just as whites in the united states quote unquote whites have to be accepting of the fact that the demographic majority is shifting to non whites in our own country but that's not what zionism was about i did write my doctoral dissertation on zionism and i don't wanna get now bogged down in abstract ideas but as i suspect you know most theorists of nationalism say there are two kinds of nationalism one is a nationalism a and then there's another kind of nationalism and that says the state should not belong to its citizens it should belong to an ethnic group each ethnic group should have its own state it's usually called the german romantic idea of nationalism zionism is squarely in the jewish german romantic idea that was the whole point of zionism we don't wanna be bundists and be one more ethnic minority in russia we don't wanna become citizens and just become a jewish people in england or france we want our own state like like the arab twenty first states no wait let's before we get to the arabs let's get let's stick to the jews for a moment or the zionist we want our own state and in that concept of wanting your own state the minority at best lives on sufferance and at worst gets expelled that's the logic of the german romantic zionist idea of a state that's why they're zionists now i personally have shied away from using the word zionism ever since i finished my doctoral dissertation because that's painful because as i said i don't believe it's the operative ideology today it's like talking about bolshevism and referring to khrushchev i doubt khrushchev could have spelled bolshevik but for the period we're talking about they were zionists they were committed to their exclusive state with with a minority living on sufferance or at worst expelled that was their ideology and i really feel there's a problem with your happy vision of these western democrats like weizmann and they wanted to live peacefully with the arabs weizmann described the explosion in nineteen forty eight as quote the miraculous clearing of the land that doesn't sound like somebody shedding too many tears at the loss of the indigenous population let me you you the word of the word of the letter the the unsufferance i don't agree with i think that's wrong mhmm the jewish state came into being in nineteen forty eight it had a population which was twenty percent arab when it came into being after arab refugees many of them had become refugees but twenty percent remained in the country twenty percent of israel's population i was talking about what remained in palestine israel received citizenship and all the rights of israelis except of course the right to serve in the army which they didn't want to and they have supreme court justices they have knesset members they enjoyed basically laws till nineteen sixty six for for a period sure they lived under emergency so they didn't beat the no no no no no no no wait this is fantasy at the beginning it's not fantasy beginning it's not fantasy at the beginning they received citizenship could vote in elections for their own people and they were put into parliament but in the first years the israeli the the jewish majority suspected that maybe the arabs would be disloyal because they had just tried to destroy the jewish state then they dropped the military government and they became fully equal citizens so if the whole idea was they must have a state without arabs this didn't happen in forty nine then why and it didn't happen in the in some sense some sense they did say professor morris yes then why did you say without a population expulsion a jewish state would not have been established because the the you're missing the first section of that paragraph which was they were being assaulted by the arabs and as a result a jewish state could not have come into being unless there had also been an expulsion of the population which was trying to kill them norm i'm officially forbidding you referencing that again we were supposed to hold on a second wayne we responded to it so the the main point you're making we have to take vanietta's word is like there was a war and that's the reason why he made that statement i think that just one last point on this i i remember reading your book when it first came out and reading you know one incident after the other and one example after the other and then getting to the conclusion where you said the nakba was a product of war not design i think we're your exa and i remember reacting almost in in in shock to that that i felt you had mobilized overwhelming evidence that it was a product of design not war and i think our discussion today very much reflects let's say dissonance between the evidence and the conclusion you don't feel that that the the research that you have conducted and published demonstrates that it was in fact inherent and inbuilt and inevitable and i think the point that norm and i are making is is that your own historical research together with that of others indisputably demonstrates that it does i think that's a fundamental disagreement we're having here can i wait yeah can i actually respond to that because this is actually i think this is emblematic of the entire conversation i watched a lot of norm's interviews and conversations in preparation for this and i hear normals say this all over and over and over again i only deal in facts i don't deal in hypotheticals i only deal in facts i only deal in facts and that seems to be the case except for when the facts are completely and totally contrary to the particular point you're trying to push the idea that jews would have out of hand rejected any state that had arabs on it or always had a plan of expulsion is just betrayed by the acceptance of the forty seven partition plan think you understand politics did i just say that there is a chasm that separates your ideology from the limits and constraints imposed by politics and reality now professor morris i suspect would agree that the zionist movement from fairly early on was committed to the idea of a jewish state i am aware of only one major study probably written forty years ago the i the binational mandatory palestine by a woman i forgot her name now you remember her i'm trying to yeah okay would you know the book i think so yeah she is the only one who tried to persuasively argue that the zionist movement was actually not formally actually committed to the binational idea but most historians of the subject agree the zionist movement was committed to the idea of a jewish state having written my the was very committed to the idea that binationalism was the dominant trend in zionism i could not agree with i couldn't go with him there but professor morris you are aware that until the biltmore resolution in nineteen forty two the zionist movement never declared it was for a jewish state why because it was politically impossible at the moment until nineteen forty two there is your ideology there are your convictions there are your operative plans and there's also separately what you say in public the zionist movement couldn't say in public we're expelling all of the arabs they can't say that and they couldn't even say we support a jewish state until nineteen forty two you're conflating two things the the the zionists wanted a jewish state correct that didn't that didn't mean that the arabs it's not the same thing they wanted a jewish state with a jewish majority but they were willing as it turned out both in thirty seven and in forty forty seven and subsequently to have an arab minority was a transfer a large arab minority seven there was a transfer to have a large arab minority in the country and they ended up with a large arab minority in the country twenty percent of the population in forty nine was arab and it still is they ended up for about five minutes before they were expelled they agreed to win until forty seven and then they were gone by march nineteen forty nine what happened in between the rejection of the partition plan and the expulsion of the arabs the arabs launched the war well yeah well i mean like it's not it wasn't random like there's a potential that agree it wasn't random was i totally agree with that yeah it was by design you can say that you can say that but in this case the facts betray you there was no arab acceptance of anything that would have allowed for a jewish state to exist of course number one and number two i think that it's entirely possible given how things happen after war that this exact same conflict could have played out and an expulsion would have happened without any ideology at play that there was a people that disagreed on who had territorial rights to a land there was a massive war afterwards and then a bunch of their friends invaded after to reinforce the idea that the jewish people in this case couldn't have a state there could have been a transfer regardless anything could have been but that's not what history is about history is about palestinian rejection it's up to any peace deal as i said over and over and and over again it when the wall was thrown into the court of the united nations they were faced with a practical problem and i for one am not going to try to adjudicate the rights and wrongs from the beginning i do not believe that if territorial displacement and dispossession was inherent in the zionist project i do not believe it can be a legitimate political enterprise now you might say that's speaking from twenty twenty two or twenty twenty where are we four now four now okay but we have to recognize that from nearly the beginning for perfectly obvious reasons having nothing to do with antisemitism anti westernism anti europeanism but because no people that i am aware of would voluntarily cede its country like you can perfectly understand native american resistance to euro colonialism you can perfectly well understand it without any anti europeanism anti whitism anti christianism they didn't wanna cede their country to invaders i think you're that's completely understandable you're minimizing the anti semitic element you minimized in arab nationalism books you minimized no no no the husseini was an anti semite the leader of the palestinian national movement in the thirties and forties was an anti semite this was one of the things which drove him and also drove him in the end to work in berlin for hitler for four years with nazi giving nazi propaganda to the arab world calling on the arabs to murder the jews that's what he did in world war two that's the leader of the palestinian arab national movement it and he wasn't alone he wasn't alone he wasn't what is it if you read your book righteous victims you can read it and read it and read it and read it as i have you will find barely a word about the arabs being motivated by antisemitism it exists though even i didn't say it doesn't exist you agree that it exists hey i don't know a single non jew who doesn't harbor antisemitic we're talking about arabs now yeah but i don't know anybody that's just part of the human condition antisemitism al qaeda was a and among the arabs so professor morris here's my problem i didn't say that in your righteous victims even when you talked about the first intifada and you talked about the second intifada and you talked about how there was a lot of influence by hamas the islamic movement you even stated that there is a lot of antisemitism in those movements but then you went on to say but of course at bottom it was about the occupation it wasn't about and i've read it yeah yeah but you're moving from different no i'm not moving ages across the ages about your whole book the the occupation began in sixty seven the one you're talking about i looked and looked and looked for evidence of this antisemitism as being a chief motor of arab resistance to pow zionism i didn't see it you like it did he make that claim i don't remember the word chief yeah it's it's a one of the elements i'm a very binary chief i'm sorry the elements yes binary please don't give me this postmodernism binary you're the one thinking in terms of black and white said the no steamboat do you have your book here talk about black it's one thirty seven in black and white thirty seven you're you're talking in black and white concepts when history is much grayer lots of things happen because of lots of reasons not one or the other and and you don't you don't seem to see that can i ask you quite because it's for them to talk to you just a very quick question what was what do you think the ideal solution was on the arab side from forty seven what would they have preferred and what would have happened if and and then then the second one what would have happened if jews would have lost the war in forty eight what do you think would have happened to the israeli population or jewish population i think the the palestinians and the arabs were explicit that they wanted a unitary i think federal state and and they made their submissions to unscop they made their appeals at the un general assembly what do you mean by unitary and federal i don't get that they wanted an arab state they wanted palestine to be an arab state yes yes simply put up for the thing the word unitary federal they wanted palestine yes but i think arab and exclusively arab state no wasn't an no wasn't an exclusively arab state i think we have to distinguish between palestinian and arab opposition to a jewish state in palestine on the one hand and palestinian and arab attitudes to jewish existence in palestine there's a fundamental difference well husseini the leader of the movement said that all the jews who had come since nineteen seventeen and that's the majority of the jews in palestine in nineteen forty seven yeah shouldn't be there well he did say shouldn't be citizens and he shouldn't be there he did he did say that sixty four i'm not gonna deny it it's it's true i can understand the sentiment but i think it's wrong but also you guys you guys are the ones we agree on the the i i wonder to tell you guys earlier because you used the words earlier that it was supremacy and exclusivity that the zionists were going to vote question as you husseini did say that and i'm sure there was a very substantial body of palestinian arab public opinion that endorsed that but by the same token i think a unitary arab state as you call it or a palestinian state could have been established with arrangements with guarantees to ensure the security and rights of of both communities how that would work in detail had had been discussed and proposed but never resolved and again i think you know jewish fears about what would have happened holocaust that's what well no i i think that was the jewish fear a second holocaust that that may well have been the jewish fear it was an unfounded jewish fear it was unfounded of course it was unfounded what about like in forty eight and fifty six you really think you really think that the palestinians had they won the war were going to import ovens and crematoria from germany that but there were programs across in almost every single arab state where there were jews living after after forty eight after fifty six after sixty seven there were always pogroms there were always flights from jews from those countries to israel afterward i don't think it would be i wouldn't i wouldn't say there were always pogroms in every arab state i think there was flight of of arab jews for multiple reasons in some cases for precisely the reasons you say if you look at the jewish community in algeria for example their flight had virtually nothing to do with the arab israeli conflict the issue of of algerian jews was that the french gave them citizenship during their colonial rule of algeria and they increasingly became identified with french rule and when algeria became independent and all the french ended up leaving out of fear or out of disappointment or out of whatever the jews were identified as french rather than algerian this is a bit of a red herring there were pogroms in the arab countries in bahrain even where there's almost no jews there was a pogrom in nineteen forty seven there was a pogrom in aleppo in nineteen forty seven i'm not i'm not denying any of that history killings of jews in iraq and egypt i'm not denying in nineteen forty eight forty nine i'm not denying it so so but the arabs the jews basically fled the arab states not for multiple reasons they fled because they felt that the governments there and the societies amid amid which they had lived for hundreds of years no longer wanted them look without without getting into the details i think we can both agree that ultimately a clear majority of arab jews who believe that after having lived in these countries for wait a minute wait for the arabs wait for the arabs for centuries for centuries for centuries for centuries for for centuries if not millennia came to the unfortunate conclusion that their situation had become untenable yes i also think that we can both agree that this had never been an issue prior to zionism and the emergence of the state of israel prior to zionism i'm i'm not didn't begin with zionism in the arab world the issue is is is is the point i raised which is whether these communities had ever come to a collective conclusion that their position had become untenable in this part of the world no they were arab jews well because untenable meant there was no alternative but with the creation of israel there was an alternative right a place where they could go and not be discriminated against or live as second class citizens or be subject to arab majority states i i also think it's interesting that like when you analyze the the flight of jewish people and and i've seen this that there it's not it wasn't just i agree with you it wasn't just a mass expulsion from all the arab states there were definitely push factors there were also pull factors now i don't know how you guys feel about the nakba but when the analysis of the nakba comes in again it's back to that well that was actually just a top down expulsion you know the retreat of wealthy arab people in the thirties didn't matter any of the messaging from the surrounding arab states didn't matter it was just an expulsion from jewish people or people running from their lives from jewish massacres again it's like that i feel like it's that selective it's a selective critical analysis of them the term jewish here because it wasn't the you know the jews of england or the soviet jews that's why i say jewish because prior to forty eight it was saying israeli the issue i guess is over it i think we should i think it's useful to to say refer to zionists before nineteen forty eight and israelis after forty eight we don't need to implicate well sure but the but the jewish people that were being attacked in arab states weren't zionists they were just jews living there right just comment on that i was rereading shlomo ben ami's last book and he does at the end discuss at some length the whole issue of the refugee question bearing on the so called peace process and on the question of forty eight and the arab emigration if you allow me let me just quote him israel is particularly fond of the awkwardly false symmetry she makes between the palestinian refugee crisis and the forced immigration of six hundred thousand jews from arab countries following the creation of the state of israel as if it were quote an unplanned exchange of unpop populations unquote and then mister ben ami for those of you who are listening he was israel's former foreign minister and he's an influential historian in his own right he says in fact envoys from the mossad and the jewish agency worked underground in arab countries and iran to encourage jews to go to israel more importantly for many jews in arab states the very possibility of immigrating to israel was the culmination of millennial aspirations it represented the consummation of a dream to take part in israel's resurgence as a nation so this idea that they were all expelled after nineteen forty eight it's that's one area professor moritz i defer to expertise that's one of my credos in life i don't know the israeli literature but as it's been translated in english there is very little solid scholarship on what happened in nineteen forty eight in the arab countries and which caused the jews to leave arab jews arab jews right but shlomo ben ami knows the literature he knows the the scholarship he knows the history from vanjieres yeah he's from morocco right so he knows from iraq is written on this issue and they wrote that the jews in the arab lands were not pro zionist they weren't zionist at all so certainly avi shlaim's family was anti zionist and avi shlaim when he was interviewed by maren rapoport on this question he said you simply cannot say that the iraqi jews were expelled it's just not true and he was speaking as an iraqi jew who left with his father father family in nineteen forty eight they were pushed out they weren't exposed that that's probably the right phrase i i think it's i think it's more complex than than that i think it was sorry i interrupted you you're not interrupting me because i don't i i only know what's been translated into english and the english literature on the subject is very small and not scholarly now there may be an hebrew literature i don't know but i was surprised that even shlomo ben ami a stalwart of his state fair enough on this particular point he called it false symmetry no no stephen is right there was a pull and push mechanism in the departure of the jews from the arab lands post forty eight but there was also a lot of push a lot of push that's that's indisputable there was push and on the point of agreement let it on this one brief light of agreement let us wrap up with this topic of history and move on to modern day but before that i'm wondering if we can just say a couple of last words on this topic steven yeah i think that when you look at the behaviors of both parties in in the time period around forty eight or especially forty eight and earlier there's this assumption that there was this huge built in mechanism of zionism and that it was going to be inevitable from the inception of the first zionist thought i i guess that appeared in herzl's mind that there would be a mass violent population transfer of arab palestinians out of what would become the israeli state i understand that there are some quotes that we can find that maybe seem to possibly support an idea that looks close to that but i think when you actually consult the record of what happened when you look at the populations the massive populations that israel was willing to accept within what would become their state borders their nation borders i just don't think that the historical record agrees with the idea that zionists would have just never been okay living alongside arab palestinians but when you look at the other side arabs would out of hand reject literally any deal that apportioned any amount of that land for any state relating to jewish people or the israeli people i think it was said even on the other end of the table that arab palestinians would have never accepted the arabs would have never accepted any jewish state whatsoever so it's interesting that on the ideology part where it's claimed that zionists are people of exclusion and supremacy and expulsion we can find that in diary entries but we can find that expressed in very real terms on the arab side i think in all of their behavior around forty eight and earlier where the goal was the destruction of the israeli state it would have been the dispossession of many jewish people it probably would have been the expulsion of a lot of them back to europe and i think that very clearly plays out in the difference between the actions of the arabs versus some diary entries of some jewish leaders benny well one thing which stood stood out and i think moeen made this point is that the arabs had nothing to do with the holocaust but then the world community forced the arabs to pay the price for the holocaust that's the traditional arab argument this is slightly distorting the reality the arabs in the 1930s did their utmost to prevent jewish emigration from europe and reaching palestine which was the only safe haven available because america britain france nobody wanted jews anywhere and they were being persecuted in central europe and eventually would be massacred in large numbers so the arab efforts to pressure the british to prevent jews reaching palestine's safe shores contributed indirectly to the slaughter of many jews in europe because they couldn't get to anywhere and they couldn't get to palestine because the arabs were busy attacking jews in palestine and attacking the british to make sure they didn't allow jews to reach this safe haven that's important the second thing is of course there's no point in belittling the fact that the arab palestinian arab national movement's leader husseini worked for the nazis in the nineteen forties he got a salary from the german foreign ministry he raised troops among muslims in bosnia for the ss and he broadcast to the arab world calling for the murder of the jews in the middle east this is what he did and the arabs since then have been trying to whitewash husseini's role i'm not saying he was the the instigator of the holocaust but he did say he helped helped the arab the germans along in in doing what they were doing and and supported them in doing that so the this can't be removed from the fact that the arabs as you say paid a price for the holocaust but they also participated in various ways in helping it happen right i'll make two points the first is you mentioned haj amin al husseini and his collaboration with the nazis entirely legitimate point to raise but i think one can also say definitively had hajj i mean that hosseini never existed the holocaust would have played out precisely certainly as it did certainly as far as palestinian opposition to jewish immigration to palestine during the 1930s is concerned it was of a different character than for example british and american rejection of jewish immigration they just didn't want jews on their soil objectively it helped the germans kill the jews in the palestinian case their opposition to jewish immigration was to prevent the transformation of their homeland into a jewish state that would dispossess them and i think that's an important distinction to make the other point i wanted to make is we've we've spent the past several hours talking about zionism transfer and so on but i think there's a more fundamental aspect to this which is that zionism i think would have emerged and disappeared as yet one more utopian political project had it not been for the british what the preeminent palestinian historian waleed khalidi has termed the british shield because i think without the british sponsorship we wouldn't be having this discussion today the british sponsored zionism for a very simple reason which is that during world war one the ottoman armies attempted to march on the suez canal suez canal was the jugular vein of the british empire you know between europe and india and the british came to the conclusion that they needed to secure the suez canal from any threat and as the british have done so often in so many places how do you deal with this well you know you you bring in a foreign minority implant them amongst a hostile population and establish a protectorate over them i don't think a jewish state in palestine had been part of british intentions and the balfour declaration very specifically speaks about a jewish national home in palestine in other words a british protectorate things ended up taking a different course and i think the the the most important development was world war two and i think this had maybe less to do with the holocaust and more to do with the effective bankruptcy of the united kingdom during that war and its inability to sustain its global empire it ended up giving up india ended up giving up palestine and it's in that context i think that we need to see the emergence of a of a jewish state in palestine and again a jewish state means a state in which the jewish community enjoys not only a demographic majority but an uncontestable demographic majority an uncontestable territorial hegemony and an uncontestable political supremacy and that is also why after nineteen forty eight the nascent israeli state confiscated i believe up to ninety percent of lands that had been previously owned by palestinians who became citizens of israel it is why the new israeli state imposed a military government on its population of palestinian citizens between nineteen forty eight and nineteen sixty six it is why the israeli state effectively reduced the palestinians living within the israeli state as citizens of the israeli state to second class citizens on the one hand promoting jewish nationalism and jewish nationalist parties on the other hand doing everything within its power to suppress and eliminate palestinian or arab nationalist movements and that's why today there's a consensus among all major human rights organizations that israel is an apartheid state with the israeli human rights organization b'tselem describes a regime of jewish supremacy between the river yes and the sea you're you're really tempting a response from the other side on on the last few sentences and we'll talk this yeah okay we'll talk about the claims of of apartheid and so on it's a fascinating discussion we need to have it norm on the question of the responsibility of the palestinian arabs for the nazi holocaust direct or indirect i consider that an absurd claim as gromyko said and i quoted him the entire western world turned its back on the jews to somehow focus on the palestinian strikes me as completely ridiculous number two as muin said there's a perfectly understandable reason why palestinian arabs wouldn't want jews because in their minds and not irrationally these jews intended to create a jewish state which would quite likely have resulted in their expulsion i'm a very generous person i've actually taken in a homeless person for two and a half years but if i knew in advance that that homeless person was going to try to turn me out of my apartment i would think ten thousand times before i took him in okay as far as the actual complicity of the palestinian arabs if you look at raoul hilberg's three volume classic work the destruction of the european jury he has in those thousand plus pages one sentence one sentence on the role of the mufti of jerusalem and that i think is probably an overstatement but we'll leave it aside the only two points i would make aside from the holocaust point is number one i do think the transfer discussion is useful because it indicates that there was a rational reason behind the arab resistance to jewish or zionist immigration to palestine the fear of territorial displacement and dispossession and number two there are two issues one is the history and the second is being responsible for your words now some people accuse me of speaking very slowly and they're advised on youtube to turn up the speed twice to three times whenever i'm on one of the reasons i speak slowly is because i attach value to every word i say and it is discomforting disorienting where you have a person who's produced a voluminous corpus rich in insights and rich in archival sources who seems to disown each and every word that you pluck from that corpus by claiming that it's either out of context or it's cherry picking words count and i agree with lex everybody has the right to rescind what they've said in the past but what you cannot claim is that you didn't say what you said i'll stick to the history not the current propaganda nineteen seventeen the british the zionist movement began way before the british supported the zionist movement for decades in nineteen seventeen the british jumped in and issued the balfour declaration supporting the emergence of a jewish national home in palestine which most people understood to mean eventual jewish statehood in palestine most people understood that in britain and in among the zionists and among the arabs but the british declared the balfour declaration or issued the balfour declaration not only because of imperial self interest and this is what you're basically saying they had imperial interests a buffer state which would protect the suez canal from the east the british also were motivated by idealism and this incidentally is how balfour described the reasoning behind issuing the declaration and he said the western world western christendom owes the jews a great debt both for giving the world and the west if you like values social values as as embodied in the the bible social justice and all sorts of other things and the christian world owes the jews because it persecuted them for two thousand years this debt we're now beginning to repay with the nineteen seventeen declaration favoring zionism but it's also worth remembering that the jews weren't proxies or attached to the british imperial endeavor they were happy to receive british support in nineteen seventeen and then subsequently when the british ruled palestine for twenty thirty years but they weren't part of the british imperial design or mission they wanted a state for themselves the jews happy to have the british support them happy today to have the americans support israel but it's not because we're stooges or extensions of american imperial interests the british incidentally always described in arab narratives or propaganda as consistent supporters of zionism they weren't the first british rulers in palestine nineteen seventeen nineteen twenty herbert samuel no before herbert samuel samuel came in nineteen twenty the british ruled there for three years previously and most of the leaders the british generals and so on who were in palestine were anti zionist and subsequently in the twenties and thirties the british occasionally curbed zionist immigration to palestine and in nineteen thirty nine switched horses and supported the arab national movement and not zionism they turned anti zionist and basically said you arabs will rule palestine within the next ten years this is what we're giving you by limiting jewish immigration to palestine but the arabs didn't actually understand what they were being given on a silver platter husseini again and he said no no we can't accept the british white paper of may nineteen thirty nine which had given the arabs everything they wanted basically self determination in an arab majority state so what i'm saying is the british at some point did support the zionist enterprise but at other points were less consistent than the support and in nineteen thirty nine until nineteen forty eight when they didn't vote even for partition for jewish statehood in palestine in the un resolution they didn't support zionism during the last decade of the mandate it's worth remembering that i i'd like to respond to that i mean speaking of propaganda i find it simply impossible to accept that balfour who as british prime minister in nineteen o five was a chief sponsor of the aliens act which was specifically he changed his mind which was specifically designed to keep persecuted eastern european jews out of the streets of the uk and who was denounced as an antisemite by the entire british jewish establishment a decade later all of a sudden changed his mind this people change their minds but when the when when when the changing of the mind just coincidentally happens to coincide with the british imperial interest i think perhaps the transformation is is is a little more superficial than he's being given credit for it it was clearly a british imperial venture and if there had been no threat to the suez canal during world war one regardless of what balfour would have thought about the jews and their contribution to history and their and their persecution and so on there would have been no balfour there real quick as a question on that why did the british ever cap immigration then from jews to that area at all well we're talking now about twenty nine thirty i'm sure but i'm saying that if it was if the whole goal was just to be an imperialist project like there were terrorist attacks from jewish from but you're you're talking i'll answer you in the forties yeah and we're talking now about nineteen seventeen and and as i mentioned earlier i don't think the british had a jewish state in mind that's why they use the term jewish national home i think what they wanted was a british protectorate loyal to and dependent upon the british i think an outstanding review of british policy towards these issues during the mandate has been done by martin bunton of the university of victoria and and he basically makes the argument that once the british realized the mess they were in certainly by the late twenties early thirties they they recognized these the mess they were in the irreconcilable differences and basically pursued a policy of just muddling on and and and muddling on in the context of british rule in palestine whose overall purpose was to serve for the development of zionist institutions yeshiva's economy and so on meant even if the british were not self consciously doing this preparing the groundwork for the eventual establishment of a jewish state i don't know if that answers your question except they did turn anti zionist to nineteen thirty nine yes of course and to maintain they were being shot off by and maintained that zionist no no before they were being shot off but maintained that anti zionist posture until nineteen forty eight okay and and if i may just also one point you mentioned haj amin al husseini during a world entirely legitimate but what i but what i would also point point out is that you had a zionist organization the lehi three hundred people three hundred people one of whom happened to become an israeli prime minister an israeli foreign minister speaker of israeli parliament maybe you should give his name yitzhak shamir proposing an alliance with nazi germany in nineteen forty one shamir proposed the well no the leahy proposed some people in the leahy proposed of which shamir was a prominent leader herring also no no okay well if he's a red herring hajduk then he's a red whale i'm sorry the lekki was an unimportant organization in the yeshuv three hundred people versus thirty thousand belong to the haganah so it was not a very important organization it's true before the holocaust actually began they wanted allies against the british where they could find it's gonna be nineteen forty one here not nineteen thirty one forty one forty one from what i recall nineteen forty they were they approached the the the the german emissary in istanbul or something yes istanbul and and and if i may proposed an alliance with nazi germany on what the leahy described as on the basis of shared ideological shared ideological principles well they said they did no they did they did revile why are you doing these things of course they said you know the state but you know that reviled you know what the statement said on the basis of a shared ideology why do you say no do you think that the next wait the last people were nazis is that what you're saying they said that said no you're saying that forget statements you like to quote things but were they were they nazis facts where the where the nazi nazis that's what i'm asking what did he say some of them said stalin the basis of the pact was there agreement on ideology there wasn't any pact they suggested i said it was an agreement right and what did the agreement say they wanted arms against the british that's what they wanted agree well that's what hoseidy wanted also also that's what no no but they they didn't work india letting people didn't work in berlin helping the nazi regime i mean it's what the ira wanted also but this is what khatramina i mean husseini did you know that he was an anti semite you've probably read some of his works yeah he wasn't just anti british and and he was also anti semitic and and the they had a common ground with hitler i i think i think we can agree every anti semite is a hitlerite i think we could that part he literally worked with the nazis to recruit people he wasn't just a guy posting absolutely revolting disgusting human being there's something happening here no but the problem is you're when you're saying i was saying you was his influence you're saying the move came with i i don't even understand of all the crimes you want to ascribe to the palestinian people trying to blame them directly indirectly indirectly or indirectly three times removed for the nazi holocaust is completely lunatic hold on the wait there's not a he's not blaming them for the holocaust he's saying that from the perspective wait wait wait no he's saying that from the perspective of jews in the region palestinians would have been part of the region that is exactly what he said i've read him you have read him understand him he's just right here believe me i'm a lot more literate than you mister baran believe the guy that wrote the stuff the wikipedia said that's great i read even be hebrew you call yourself a an israeli i i different ground look i just want if i can just respond to no no no i'm just saying that the there there were two there were two tricks absolutely there were that's fine there were two tricks tricks that are being played here that i think is interesting one is you guys claim that the leahy was trying to forge an alliance with nazi germany because of a shared ideology that's what they said yeah but hold on no no no no no no no no it's about what you said you brought that up to imply that zionism must be inextricably linked to no i'm sorry wait what no you're putting words in my mouth okay wait well then what was the purpose of of saying that the lehi claimed that they the lehi who were the reason i talked about people that were reviled by many in israel in not many by everybody practically well they were called terrorists so reviled communist movement called them terrorists yes yes and and how should the and how should the and how should the the chairman of shamir called himself a terrorist they were so irrelevant that their leader ended up being kicked upstairs to the leader of the israeli parliament that's israeli parliament to the israel years in to israeli foreign minister and begum is also a par yes you wanna you wanna characterize him as irrelevant as well go ahead no characterizing as relevant or irrelevant based on what happens decades later the timeline matters well the question is what is the point of saying that the lahey tried to forge an alliance why why is why is why is relevant is bringing up the mufti of jerusalem and trying to blame the holocaust no the leader of the palestine arab national movement was three hundred people as much to do with the nazi holocaust as i did no he recruited people for the ss how can you get away from them no he recruited soldiers people for the ss he recruited soldiers in the balkans mostly kosovars which was disgusting i have no doubt about that but he had one he got foreign ministers one said don't let the jews out i informative i do not have a problem receive letters from husseini during during the holocaust once during the holocaust don't let the jews out don't let the jews out i'm not saying he was a major architect of the holocaust minor but if we're agreed statements if we're agreed yes that haj amin al husseini the mufti of jerusalem collaborated with the nazis during world war two and actively sought their sponsorship why is it irrelevant and probably wanted the destruction of european jewry he probably wanted a lot of things okay okay if that's relevant why is it irrelevant that a prime minister of israel not prime minister nineteen forty forty one he wasn't prime minister of israel he was a leader of a very small terrorist suit so do you consider terrorist by the mainstream of zionism do you consider it irrelevant that many years ago mahmoud abbas wrote a doctoral thesis which is basically tantamount about mahmoud abbas okay but but i don't but didn't bring it up you're the one who's bringing it up i'm bring but you consider that one belittling the holocaust that's what you're saying the president president of the palestinian national authority belittled the holocaust saying it didn't happen or only a few jews died that's a fair characterization of i didn't bring it up i brought it up yeah okay because my question is then why is shamir's antecedency relevant he he was a terrorist leader of a very small marginal group but because said he was the head of the movement at the time also the the point of bringing up husseini harris i think there's no point the point of bringing up husseini's stuff wasn't to say that he was a great further of the holocaust it's that he might have been a great further in the prevention of jews fleeing to go to palestine to escape the holocaust that was the that was the point that and i explained why i think that's that's not an entirely accurate characterization but and then i wanted to make another point if it's legitimate to bring up his role during world war two why is it illegitimate to bring up a man who would become israel's speaker of parliament foreign minister yes for instance why is it and and also he was young was also responsible for the murder of of the united nations' first international envoy bernadotte focci bernadotte why is all that irrelevant i don't think anybody understood i don't understand i think that the the reason why he was brought up was because jewish people at the in this time period would have viewed it as there was a prevention of jews leaving europe because of the palestinians pressuring the british to put a curb that seventy five thousand yeah immigration limit yes but it's not about like it's not about them furthering the holocaust or being an architect major minor play in the holocaust well i absolutely we use a major play in that region so i'm wondering if like morris was specific made the specific claim that the palestinians played an indirect role in the holocaust the indirect role would have been the prevention of people escaping from yes your active and my response to that is first of all i i disagree with that characterization but second of all how can you disagree with that they prevented they forced the british to prevent emigration of jerusalem europe and reaching safe shores in palestine that's what they did again and they knew that the jews were being persecuted in europe was palestine the only spot of land on earth yes basically that was the problem the jews couldn't elevate europe what about your great friends in britain the architects of of the balfour declaration by the late nineteen thirties were born happy to take in jews and and americans weren't happy to take jews and why are palestinians who were not europeans who had zero role in the rise of nazism who had no relation to any of this why are they somehow uniquely responsible for what happened in europe and uniquely called the only safe haven for jews that's right the united states wasn't a say a potential state safe haven the only one was palestine at the time the united states had no room no it had room to pacific for jews it did have room but it didn't so that wasn't the only one safe haven this is something you'll be focusing your anger on race should be blamed for not letting jews in during the thirties they are blamed but nobody blames them for the holocaust well indirectly indirectly i've never heard it said that franklin delano roosevelt was indirectly responsible for the holocaust i never heard that now maybe it's in israeli literature because the israelis have gone mad your yes your prime minister said the whole idea of the gas chambers came from the mufti of jerusalem that's nonsense yeah we all know that nonsense we also know that netanyahu said netanyahu says netanyahu says so many things which are and he happens to be the pro i i i i be responsible for israel no i can't be responsible for not responsible for them but it is relevant that he's the longest serving prime minister of israel unfortunately he says to the israeli public right and he gets and he gets selected not despite saying such things but because he says such stuff his voters don't care about kaderm el husseini or hitler they know nothing about his voters they will be right his base know nothing about know nothing about anything and he can say what he likes and they'll say yes or they don't care if he says these things you may well be right but but but anyway not to beat a dead horse but i don't i i still don't understand dead horse you're right i i'll just conclude by saying i don't understand why the mufti of jerusalem is relevant he is relevant he is relevant but the head of the national shamir is not palestinian that's right shamir wasn't the head of the national movement he represented a hundred or two hundred or three hundred gunmen who are considered terrorists by the zionist movement at the time the fact that thirty years later he becomes prime minister that's the quirks of of history and his and his history but hatem el al hussein he was the head of the palestine arab national movement at the time anyway i what can you do i think we're speaking past each other but we're not we're not talking facts let's move to the modern day and we'll return to history maybe sixty seven and other important moments but let's look to today in the recent months october seventh let me ask sort of a pointed question was october seventh attacks by hamas on israel genocidal was it was it an act of ethnic cleansing just so we lay out the moral calculus that we are engaged in i don't maybe it was the the problem the problem with october seventh is this the hamas fighters who invaded southern israel were sent ordered to murder rape and do all the nasty things that they did and they killed some twelve hundred israelis that day and abducted them as we know something like two hundred and fifty civilian mostly civilians also some soldiers took them back to gaza dungeons in gaza but they were motivated not just by the words of their current leader in the gaza strip but by their ideology which is embedded in their charter from eight nineteen eighty eight if i remember correctly and that charter is genocidal it says that the jews must be eradicated basically from the land of israel from palestine the jews are described there as sons of apes and pigs the jews are a base people killers of prophets and they should not exist in palestine it doesn't say that they necessarily should be murdered all around the world the hamas charter but certainly the jews should be eliminated from palestine and this is the driving ideology behind the massacre of the jews on october seventh which brought down on the gaza strip and i think with the intention by the hamas of the israeli counteroffensive because they knew that that counteroffensive would result in many palestinian dead because the hamas fighters and their weaponry and so on were embedded in the population in gaza and they hoped to benefit from this in the eyes of world public opinion as israel chased these hamas people and their ammunition dumps and so on and killed lots of palestinian civilians in the process all of this was understood by sinwar by the head of the hamas and he strived for that but initially he wanted to kill as many jews as he could in the border areas around the gaza strip i'll respond directly to the points you made and then i'll leave it to norm to bring in the historical context that hamas charter is from the nineties i think nineteen eighty eight nineteen eighty eight so it's from the eighties i think your characterization of that charter as anti semitic is indisputable okay i think your characterization of that charter as genocidal is off the mark it's implicit and more importantly that charter has been superseded by a new charter in fact has been well there is there is a there is no new charter there is a new charter explanation a statement twenty eighteen before the course of two thousand and something eighteen two thousand eighteen supposedly clarifying things which are in the charter and but it doesn't actually step back from what the charter says eliminate israel eliminate the jews from the land of israel and and twenty eighteen the hamas charter if we look at the current version of the charter it's not the qualitor whether whether you're calling it a charter it wasn't it meant the only thing called the charter is what was issued in nineteen eighty eight by yassir himself anyway it make it makes a clear distinction between jews and zionists in twenty eighteen now you can choose to dismiss it believe it it's sincere it's insincere whatever i insincere is probably the right word secondly i'm really unfamiliar with fighters who consult these kinds of documents before before they go on system in the kindergarten they're told kill the jews they they practice with make believe guns and uniforms when they're five years old in the kindergartens of the hamas at the instruction of the commissioner general of unrwa right i didn't say that i said the hamas has kindergartens and summer camps in which they train to kill jews children second five and six secondly you keep you keep saying jews to which i would respond they use the word jews to which i would respond that hamas does not have a record of deliberately targeting jews who are not israelis and in fact it also doesn't have a record of deliberately targeting either jews or israelis outside israel and palestine so you know all this talk of unlike the hezbollah which has targeted well we're talking about jews outside of palestine we're talking about october seventh and hamas if you'd also like to speak about hezbollah let's get to that separately if you don't mind so again genocidal well again genocidal well if if that term is going to be discussed my first response would be let's talk about potentially genocidal actions against israelis rather than against jews for the reasons that i just mentioned and again i find this constant conflation of jews israel zionism to be a bit disturbing secondly i think there are quite a few indications in the factual record that raise serious questions about the accusations of the genocidal intent and and genocidal practice of what happened happened on october seventh and my final point would be i don't i don't think i should take your your word for it i don't think you should take my word for it i think what we need here is a proper independent international investigation and the reason we need that of genocide during this conflict whether by palestinians on october seventh or israel thereafter and the reason that we need such an investigation is because hamas is there won't be any hearings on what hamas did on october seventh at the international court of justice because the international convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide deals only with with states and not with movements i think the international criminal court and specifically its current prosecutor karim khan lacks any and all credibility he's been an absolute failure at his job he's just been sitting on his backside for years on this file and i think i would point out that hamas has called for independent investigations of all these allegations israel has categorically rejected any international investigation of course fully supported by the united states and i and i think what is required is to have credible investigations of these things because i don't think you're going to convince me i don't think i'm going to convince you and this is two people sitting across the table from each other there's certain things you don't even have to investigate you know how many citizens civilians died in the october seventh fall but that's not you know that there are lots of allegations of rape i don't know how persuaded you are of those they did find bodies without heads which is there were no beheadings of infants there were there were some beheadings apparently the israelis didn't even claim that in the document they submitted before the icj go read what your government submitted it never mentioned beheadings well as far as i know i've read people who were beheaded but they we could bring it up right now also deny that there were rapes there i didn't deny i said i've not seen convincing evidence that confirms it i've said that from day one and i'll say today four and a half months later do you know that they killed eight or nine hundred civilians in their source absolutely that seems to me indisputable oh okay well i'm glad that you're confusing the thing i've said that from day one well to be clear you haven't you did a debate i don't remember the talk show but you seem to imply that there was a lot of cross killed a lot of i said that there is no question because the names were published in haritz there's no question that roughly of the twelve hundred people killed eight hundred of them were civilians i see eight fifty eight fifty fine so i never said that but then i said no we don't know exactly how they were killed but eight hundred civilians killed no eight hundred fifty no question there and i also said on repeat occasions there cannot be any doubt in my opinion as of now with the available evidence that hamas was responsible for significant atrocities and i made sure to include the plural there's a lot of tricky language being employed here do you think of the eight hundred fifty it's called attaching value to words and not talking like a motor mouth okay i am very careful about qualifying because that's what wedding would be about that's great then let me just ask a clarifying question do you firmly believe that the majority of the eight hundred and fifty civilians were killed by hamas my view is even if it were half four hundred is a huge number by any reckoning know i agree with muinne rabani i'm not sure if he concedes the four hundred i'll say why four hundred because i have thought of the four hundred right i said hundred of the eight hundred and fifty well because by hamas it's my idea couple of individuals were killed in this video i don't i don't know you're saying from day one you believe this particular thing and you clearly don't you clearly don't believe this thing you know one i said you said people died that's not controversial wait hold on hold on if i may that's not controversial mister bunnell mister bunnell i attach value to words yes you've said that when i when i talk mister bonnell please slow down the speech and attempt to listen when i was explicitly asked by piers morgan i said there can be no question that hamas committed atrocities i've heard this yes on october seventh if you want me to pin down a number i can't do that and ask you a pin down number you can listen to what i'm asking no my question is okay i'll ask you i'll ask you very precise sorry you'll be confusing it's it's a very easy question my question is do you think the majority of the people that were killed on october seventh the civilians were killed by hamas yes or are we subscribing to the idea that the idf killed hundred no four or five hundred no the crossfire let me explain why that's a difficult question to answer the total number of civilians killed was eight hundred eight hundred fifty mhmm we know that hamas is responsible probably for the majority of those killings we also know that there were killings by islamic jihad we also know we're we're bunching together the islamic jihad and the hamas so that's splitting hairs now specific no but he means he means the raiders i mean the raiders i'm speaking i'm speaking in opposition to the conspiracy theory that people like do you prefer norm or professor franklestein or what do you i don't know what you're how do you prefer this not a conspiracy theory because well the the conspiracy theory is the idea that the idf killed the majority of them it's not a conspiracy theory and then there's also there's also a theory that as norm pointed out on the show that he was on that he thought that it was very strange that given how reputable israeli services are when it comes to sending ambulances retrieving bodies he thought it was very strange that that number was continually being adjusted and do you know why say that in combination with well i'm not sure how many were killed out of the city do you know why the number went down the number went down because the israeli authorities were in were in possession of two hundred corpses that were burnt to a crisp that they assumed were israeli israelis who had been killed on october seventh they later determined that these were in fact palestinian fighters now how does a palestinian fighter get burnt to a crisp no you're mixing two things that's yeah that's some of the bodies they didn't weren't able to identify and eventually they just ruled that some of them were actually arab marauders rather than israeli victims some a few of them also of the jews were burnt to a crisp and it took them time to work themselves and they came out initially with a slightly higher figure fourteen hundred dead and eventually reduced it to twelve hundred dead israelis and the reason is that a proportion of israeli civilians killed on october seventh i don't believe it was a majority we don't know how many some were killed in crossfire some were killed by israeli shellfire helicopter fire and so on and the majority were killed by palestinians and of that majority we don't know i mean again i i understood your question as referring specifically to hamas which is why i tried to answer it that way but if you meant generically palestinians yes if you mean specifically hamas we don't have a clear breakdown of how we're specifically hamas but i just think when you use the word some that's doing a lot of heavy lifting use some that's fine but some can mean anywhere from one percent to forty nine percent but we don't know some so the numbers here and the details are interesting and important almost from a legal perspective but if we zoom out the moral perspective are palestinians from gaza justified in violent resistance well palestinians have the right to resistance palestinian that right includes the right to armed resistance at the same time armed resistance is subject to the laws of war and there are very clear regulations that separate legitimate acts of armed resistance from acts of armed resistance that are not legitimate and i the attacks of october seventh where do they land for you there's been almost exclusive focus on the attacks on civilian population centers and and the killings of civilians on october seventh what is much much less discussed to the point of amnesia is that there were very extensive attacks on israeli military and intelligence facilities on october seventh i would make a very clear distinction between those two and secondly i'm not sure that i would characterize the efforts by palestinians on october seventh to seize israeli territory and israeli population centers as in and of themselves illegitimate you mean attacking israeli civilians is legitimate no no that's not what i said understand what you said i think what you had on october seventh was an effort by hamas to seize israeli territory and population systems civilians that's not what i said what i said is i think i i'm i'm i would not describe the effort to seize israeli territory as in and of itself illegitimate as a separate issue from the killing of israeli civilians where in those cases where they had been deliberately targeted that's very clearly legitimate families were slaughtered in kibbutz but i'm making but many of them many of them left wingers incidentally who helped palestinians go to hospitals in israel and so on again even drove palestinian cancer patients to hospitals that really i'm making a distinction here to be very condemnatory of what hamas did i i don't do selective condemnation i'm not talking about selective i don't do selective outrage condemnation of this specific well you know what you know what is you know i i would i would for example condemn israeli assaults on civilians deliberate assaults on civilians i would condemn them but you're not doing that with the hamas you know what the issue is i've been speaking in public now i would say since the late nineteen eighties and interviewed and so on i have never on one occasion ever been asked to condemn any israeli act when i've been in group discussions those supporting the israeli action or perspective i have never encountered an example where these individuals are asked to condemn what israel is doing the the the demand and obligation of condemnation is exclusively applied and my personal experience over decades is exclusively applied to palestinians no this is and those as well is condemned day and night on every television channel no no on every and has been for the last decade personal experience lasting decades you said quote uh-oh oh no i'm trying to quote what you just said i shouldn't have said anything at any time you should say professor morris yes you just said i would condemn anytime israel deliberately attacks civilians yes okay the problem professor morris is over and over again you claim in the face of overwhelming evidence that they didn't attack civilians that's not true i've said israel has attacked civilians professor kim israel attacks terrorism right professor kim extensively about it i know that in kafro kasim the and now let's let's so you're you're you're just eliminating you're selecting okay as as as stephen says you cherry pick if i were you you cherry pick let's fast forward when you were an adult what did you say about the nineteen eighty two lebanon war what did i say you don't remember okay allow me uh-oh okay so it happens that i was not at all by any i had no interest in the israel palestine conflict as a young man until the nineteen true until the nineteen eighty two lebanon war yeah lost the passage i'll find it okay real quick while he's searching for that yeah allow me something that's really important that a lot of people don't draw a distinction between and that there is just causes for war and there is just ways to act within a war and these two things principally do have a distinction from one another correct however while i appreciate the recognition of the distinction the idea that the the cause for war that hamas was engaged in i don't believe if we look at their actions in war or the statements that they've made it doesn't seem like it had to do with territorial acquisition no no no no i the the point making land back the point i was making was what was hamas trying to achieve militarily on october seventh and i was pointing out that the focus has been very much on hamas attacks on civilians and atrocities and so on and i'm not saying those things should be ignored what i'm saying is that what's getting lost in the shuffle is that there were extensive attacks on military and intelligence facilities mhmm and as far as the let's say the other aspects are concerned because i think either you or lex asked me about the legitimacy of these attacks i said i'm i'm unclear whether efforts by hamas to seize israeli population centers in and of themselves are illegitimate as opposed to actions that either deliberately targeted israeli civilians or actions that should reasonably have been expected to result in the killings of israeli civilians those strike me as by definition illegitimate and i wanna be very clear about that i have where i illegitimate means you condemn them illegitimate means they are not legitimate i i have a problem condemning your side yes sir no not condemning my side i have a problem with selective outrage and i have a problem with selective condemnation and as i i explained to you a few minutes ago in my decades of appearing in public and being interviewed i have never seen i've never been asked to condemn an israeli action i've never been asked for a moral judgment on an israeli action exclusive request for condemnation has to do with what palestinians do and just as importantly i'm sure if you watch bbc or cnn when is the last time an israeli spokesperson has been asked to condemn an israeli act i've i've never seen it i don't think we condemn the arab side either though right i don't think there was any condemnation that we're watching that we're talking about israeli victims all of a sudden morality is is well i i think the reason why it comes up is because there's no shortage of international condemnation for israel as norm will point out a million times that there are fifty billion un resolutions you've got amnesty international you've got multiple bodies of the un you've got now this case for the icj so there's no question of if there's condemnation but but sorry if i can interrupt you in nineteen forty eight the entire world stood behind the establishment of a jewish state in the entire world except the arab states and the muslim states well not the entire world okay but i think you know what i mean by that the western democracies that's what you're saying well then also my quick question supported the establishment of israel my quick question was you said that you believe that this is a very short one you don't have to it's just you think that you think that there's an argument to be made that the people in gaza hamas and islamic jihad whoever participated had a just cause for war maybe they didn't do it in the correct way but they maybe had a just cause for war i would think there's a maybe there the palestinian absolutely had a just cause for it do you think that israel has a just cause for operation swords of iron no of course not okay alright you can say your quote okay first of all on this issue of double standards which is the one that irks or irritates wayne you said that you are not a person of double standards unlike people like muinne you hold high a single standard and you condemn deliberate israeli attacks on civilians when they infringe yeah and i would say that's true for the period up till nineteen sixty seven and i think it's accurate you your account of the first intifada there it seems to me you were in conformity with most mainstream accounts and the case of the first intifada you also used surprisingly you used arab human rights sources like al haq which i think muin worked for yes during the first intifada that's true but then something very strange happens so let's illustrate it wait there's something strange which happened is the arabs rejecting the peace offers okay wait that could happen well by accepting the oslo agreements yeah i reject each time i can't pay a man if we have time i know the record very well i'd be very happy to go through it with you but let's get to those double standards so this is what you have to say about israel's invasion of lebanon in nineteen eighty two you said israel was reluctant to harm civilians sought to avoid casualties on both sides and took care not to harm lebanese and palestinian civilians you then went on to acknowledge the massive use of idf firepower against civilians during the siege of beirut which traumatized israeli society marx morris quickly enters the caveat that israel quote tried to pinpoint military targets but inevitably many civilians were hit that's your description of the lebanon war as i say that's when i first got involved in the conflict i am a voracious reader i read everything on the lebanon war i would say there's not a single account of the lebanon war in which the estimates are between fifteen and twenty thousand palestinian lebanese were killed overwhelmingly civilians the biggest bloodletting until the current gaza genocide biggest bloodletting i would say i can't think of a single mainstream account that remotely approximates what you just said so leaving aside i can name the books voluminous huge volumes i'll just take one example now you will remember because i think you served in lebanon in eighty two am i correct on that yeah yep yeah so you remember that dov yarmia kept the war diary so with your permission allow me to describe what he wrote during his diary so he writes the war machine of the idf is galloping and trampling over the conquer conquered territory demonstrating a total insensitivity insensitivity to the fate of the arabs who are found in its path a plo run hospital suffered a direct hit thousands of refugees are returning to the city when they arrive at their homes many of which have been destroyed or damaged you hear their cries of pain and their howls over the deaths of their loved ones the air is lebanon war forget my descriptions forget it the point you're making are in print we can't see it let me let me just finish my sentence the point you're making mhmm which you somehow forget is that there are israelis who strongly criticize their own side and describe how israelis are doing things which they regard as immoral you don't find that on the arab side i'm talking about you don't find that mister morris i'm not talking about death don't be a is the lebanese talking about you the historian how did you depict the lebanon war me i believe that the israeli military tried to avoid committing a civilian capital so dev as accounts by robert fisk and pity the nation yeah i know all all the journalists i know journalist i know has always been right so that's why that's why you can say with such confidence that you don't commit you don't condemn deliberate israeli attacks and stuff i do because there weren't any no i didn't say there weren't any yeah you didn't you agreed that i have condemned israeli yes there are syrians i never quarrel with facts your your description of the nineteen eighties two war is so shocking it makes my inners writhe and then your description of the second intifada your description of defensive shield when they when the arab they are worse is that when arab suicide bombers apologize when arab suicide bombers with destroying the force of the jews in masses in buses and in restaurants no that's the second intifada do you remember that you can try suicide bombers in jerusalem's buses restaurants i am completely aware of that i will but if you forgot the numbers no i don't forget the numbers was three to one the number killed mostly armed no palestinian government that's what you say in your book that's what i but that's not what amnesty international said that's not what human rights was i don't remember what they said i do no no that's not what that said is right i listen listen listen in the second he rather some four thousand palestinian people most of them armed people and the israelis that's a israelis were killed almost all of them gave civilians professor morris fantasy but i'm not gonna argue with here here's a simple challenge you said not to look at the camera sometimes scares the people i'll make the open challenge you are going to scare them no professor morris open challenge words are in print i wrote fifty pages analyzing all of your work i quote some will say cherry pick but i think accurately quote you here's a simple challenge answer me in print answer what i wrote and show where i'm making things up answer me a print i'm not familiar i'm i'm sorry i'm not familiar with your that's no problem you're a busy man you're an important historian you don't have to know everything that's in print especially by modest publishers but now you know and so here's the public challenge you answer and show where i cherry picked where i misrepresented send me the alphabetical solutions and then we can have a civil scholarly discussion i'm not sure we will agree even if we don't have to agree understand the argument it's for the reader to decide looking at both sides okay where this truth stands no ma'am and if i may ask yeah it's good to discuss ideas that are in the air now as opposed to citing literature that was written in the past as much as possible mhmm because listeners were not familiar with the literature so like whatever was written just express it condense the the key idea and then we can debate the ideas of this question two aspects there's a public debate but there's also written words yes i'm just telling you that you as a as a academic historian put a lot of value in the written word and i think it is valuable but in this he's incidentally not the only historian who puts value to words yes i also do actually activity yeah just in the so we the one and just one or two sentences at a time in but this this in this context just for the educational purpose of teaching people purpose is why would people commit what i have to acknowledge because i am faithful to the facts massive atrocities on october seventh why did that happen and i think that's the problem the past is erased and we suddenly went from nineteen forty eight to october seventh twenty twenty three and there is a problem there so first of all you have complete freedom to backtrack and we'll go there with you obviously we can't cover every single year every single event but there's probably critical moments in time can i respond to something relating to that the lebanon war i looked at the book that he got this from where the quote was from it sounds cold to say it but war is tragic and civilians die there is no war that this has not happened in in the history of all of humankind the statement that israel might take care not to target civilians is not incompatible with a diary entry from someone who said they saw civilians getting killed i think that sometimes we do a lot of weird games when we talk about international humanitarian law or laws that govern conflict where we say things like civilians dying is a war crime or civilian homes or hospitals getting destroyed isn't necessarily a war crime or is necessarily somebody intentionally targeting civilians without making distinctions between military targets or civilian ones i think that when we analyze different attacks or when we talk about the conduct of a military i think it's important to understand like prospectively from the unit of analysis of the actual military committing the acts what's happening and what are the decisions being made rather than just saying retrospectively oh well a lot of civilians died not very many you know military people died comparatively speaking so it must have been war crimes especially when you've got another side i'll fast forward to hamas that intentionally attempts to induce those same civilian numbers because hamas is guilty of any war crime that you would potentially accuse and this is according to amnesty international people that norm loves to cite hamas is guilty of all of these same war crimes of them failing to take care of the civilian population of them essentially utilizing human shields to try to fire rockets free from attacks essentially essentially yes if i let me as in i'm just saying that essentially as in terms of how international law defines and not how amnesty international defines it but amnesty international describes times of human shielding but they don't actually apply the correct international legal standard what's the code i know absolutely you absolutely i absolutely don't think you can but but i'm just saying i'm just saying believe it or not norm the entire geneva convention is all on wikipedia it's a wonderful one but i'm just saying i'm just saying that on the hamas side if there's an attempt to induce this type of military activity attempt to induce civilian harm that is not just enough to say like well here's a diary entry where a guy talks about how traffic impacts that i think the problem i think the problem with with with your statement is that if you go back and listen to it the first part of it is war as hell civilians die it's it's a fact of life and and and you state that in a very factual matter then when you start talking about hamas all of a sudden you've discovered morality and you've discovered condemnation and you've discovered intent and and and you are unfortunately far from alone in this i'll give you i'll give you you know who for me is a perfect example hold on we're just in response we don't need examples no i i we the the the false equivalency of the two sides is astounding when hamas kills civilians in a surprise attack on october seventh this isn't because they are attempting to target military targets and they happen to stumble into into a giant festival of people that well they did happen to stumble into it they did but they're but they did but they did but when they stumbled into it that wasn't an issue of trying to figure out a military target or not they weren't failing a distinction there wasn't a proportionality assessment done it was just to kill civilians even the amnesty international in two thousand eight and in twenty fourteen and even today will continue to say that anyone who will deny that hamas has targeted civilians sure you gave the example but there's a difference because of suicide bombings during the second intifada i mean facts are facts sure but i'm saying that the hamas targeting against civilians is different than the incidental loss of life that occurs when israel does how you know genocide is the intentional mass murder genocide is a entirely separate claim yeah but the idea that israel is not in the business of intentionally targeting civilians i know that's what we're supposed to believe but but the historical record stands no no that's not clearly i don't believe it's not you've written about well when you say historical do you mean like in the forties to the sixties or do you mean like over the past cycles from the thirties of the last century to the twenties of this century i i just like to make you know you the way the way you characterized it i think the best example of that i've come across during this specific conflict is is john kirby the white house spokesman i've i've named him tirz tostaron for a very good reason when he's talking about palestinian civilian deaths war is hell you know it's a fact of life get used to it when he was confronted with israeli civilian that's on october seventh he literally broke down in tears about that one is deliberate and one isn't he understood that no that's what he tried to make us understand no he he he was speaking facts that hamas guys who attacked the kibbutzim they apart from the attacks on the military sites when they attacked the kibbutzim were out to kill civilians and they killed family after family house after house the israeli attacks on hamas installation and fighting they don't know better no you don't know israeli pilots that's the problem thank god you know you no you don't know israeli pilots they believe that they are killing hamas snakes they're given instructions i'm sure they believe it they believe it and if the hamas is hiding behind civilians die believe time they target simple as that every time they target a kid i'm sure they believe it's hamas when they kid yeah when they yeah when they killed the four kids in the in the they believed yeah they believed i know they believed even though they were you the negative side you know even though they were yeah that's right see the side no they saw it don't see the side let's see the side oh i know what he's quoting correct you've lied about this particular instance in the past those kids weren't just on the beaches as opposition articles those kids were literally coming out of a previously identified hamas compound that they have operated from they literally said you could do good mister gulrelli with all due respect with all due respect you're such a fantastic moron it's terrifying that that wharf was filled with journalists there were tens scores of journalists that was an old fisherman's shack what are you talking about it's so painful neighbors it's so painful to listen to this idiocy and to be clear on the other side you're implying that strike was okayed on the israeli side where they said we're just gonna sell four palestinians today for no reason hey do you believe that do you believe that do you believe that journalist do you think that they will be in a hotel quarantine motel children here we go they will never answer that i will answer the question pilots will outsource i will even answer the question animals because i was a strike i was a drone strike that was a proof all we have to say that we're gonna kill children and i'm gonna kill palestinian people me to answer or do you want your motor mouth to go okay answer in twenty eighteen there was the great march of return in gaza by all reckonings of human rights organizations and journalists who were there it was overwhelmingly nonviolent it was done by the hamas whoever organized it was organized by satan let's start with that by hamas no it's satan i agree let's let's go for the big one the big megillah it's satan okay overwhelmingly organized overwhelmingly nonviolent resemble at the beginning the first bombs you and them the first intifada they call you yeah okay not bombs but they call they call rules in this text okay obviously let's continue yeah so but i'm not sure israel behaved morally in that thing okay okay no no i i i wait wait wait wait willing to grant you please please i'm willing to grant you allow me allow me to you don't have to proceed with this i'm willing to grant you this i don't know anything about this i'd like to hear you so as you know along the gaza perimeter there was israel's best trained snipers correct i don't know best trained there were snipers fine sniper okay alright they're just hey laugh it's hilarious the story is so funny you're lying about it's very much referred to as aspects of violence to it before even the un says it themselves okay okay but you only collect what the un says that you like the problem mister morelli is you don't know the ling english language you don't know i can read it from the un website itself in regards to the great march of twenty eighteen they said while the vast majority of protesters have acted in a peaceful manner during most protests dozens have approached the fence tempting to damages burning fires throwing stones and molotov cocktails towards israeli forces flying incendiary kites and balloons into israeli territory the latter results in of an extensive damage to agricultural land and nature reserves inside israel and risk the lives of israeli civilians some in this of shooting and throwing them explosives yeah talk fast talk fast so people think that you're coherent i'm just reading from the un yeah but you see i know you like the meantime i believe they agree with you there you got the months wrong you got the months wrong we're talking about the beginning in march thirtieth twenty ten describe that march as mostly people allow me to finish so there were the snipers okay now you find it so far fetched israelis purposely deliberately targeting civilians that's such a far fetched idea an overwhelmingly nonviolent march what did the international what was the march it was a campaign yeah whichever you wanna call it for months whatever you wanna call it months yeah what did the un investigation find well he just read it i read the report i don't read things off of those machines i read the report what did it find brace yourself you thought it was so funny the idea of idf targeting civilians it found go look this up on your machine i already know what you're gonna say you're gonna say it found that only one or two of them were were justified by civilians targeted journalists targeted medics and here's the funniest one of all it's so hilarious they targeted disabled people who were three hundred meters away from the fence and just standing by trees true if if it's true mhmm but you have to just quick pause mhmm i think everything was fascinating to listen to except the mention of hilarious nobody finds any of this hilarious and if any of us are laughing not there it's not at the suffering of civilians or suffering of anyone it's at the the obvious joyful camaraderie in the room so i'm i'm enjoying it and also the joy of learning so thank you can we talk about the targeting civilian thing a little bit i think there's like an important underlying issue yeah not necessarily that i just i think it's important to understand yeah i think it's important to understand there's like three different things here that we need to think about so one is a policy of killing civilians do we so i would ask the other side i'll i'm gonna ask all three because i know there won't be a short answer do you think there is a policy top down from the idf to target civilians that's one thing yeah a second thing is he said yes when i entered yeah sure no yeah that's my what he meant to say but then then the second thing is or there's there's two distincts i wanna draw between i think benny would say this i would say this i'm sure undoubtedly there have been cases where idf soldiers for no good reason have targeted and killed palestinians that they should not have done that would be prosecutable as war crimes as defined by the rumination act some have been prosecuted yeah and i'm and i'm absolutely sure all the way up practically not i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure you and your fellow i'm sure i'm sure that we would all agree for soldiers that that happens but i think that it's important i think that it's important that when we talk about military strikes when we talk about things especially involving bombings or drone attacks these are things that are signed off by multiple different layers of command by multiple people involved in an operation including intelligence gathering including weaponeering and there also have typically lawyers involved when you make the claim that an idf soldier shot a palestinian those three people the three hostages that came up with white flags and something horrible happened i think that's a fair statement to make and i think a lot of criticism is deserved but when you make the statement that four children were killed by a strike the claim that you're making yeah come separately yeah the claim that you're making the claim that you're making is that multiple levels of the idea have signed off i never on just killing i have no idea what that's great if you don't understand the process then let me educate you i can tell you i do understand the process i'm telling you i'm trying to explain right now ideas i'm no i it's basically not asking anybody to stop from wikipedia can you tell me how many people you can talk to people who work in the military what's your knowledge of the idea audience can look this up do you think that do you think that do you think that bombing and strikes are decided by one person in the field do you think one person is going to your plane or drone strikes the pilot doesn't do it though yes strike can i respond to minor apparatuses that are designed to figure out how to strike and who to strike so when you say that four children are targeted you're saying that a whole apparatus is threatened to murder for palestinian children argument better than me it because oh really that it's impossible at the command level it's impossible at the command level but you said that they couldn't have done it at the bottom if it weren't also so you see tom you don't understand the strength of the claim that you're making you're saying that from a top down level that lawyers multiple commanders all of the organizers are looking to find off not tell me what i don't understand for palestinians it's true it's true i don't spend my nights on wikipedia i read books i admit that as a a signal waste of i know books are a waste of time with all due regard there you arthur i'm letting you take from them are two or three quotes that you use i completely respect i completely respect the fact and i'll say it on the air as much as i find totally disgusting what's come of your politics a lot of the books are excellent and i'll even tell you because i'm not afraid of saying it whenever i have to check on a basic fact the equivalent of going to the britannica i go to your books i know you got a lot of the facts right benny morris that's so personal i would never say books are a waste of time and it's regrettable to you that you got strapped with a partner who thinks that all the wisdom time all the wisdom he didn't say they're a waste of time i i'd like to respond yes please to what you were saying the the i think the question that that we're trying to answer i think you don't understand israel you know i neither let me let me finish this understands israel i think we're all how it works i think we're all agreed yeah that palestinians have deliberately targeted civilians whether we're talking about hamas and islamic jihad today or previously i prefer the word murdered and raped rather than targeted target is too soft for what the hamas did i'm okay with that i'm not i'm not talking about i'm talking about this now yeah but i'm i'm trying to answer his question yeah yeah historically there is substantial evidence that palestinians have targeted civilians whether whether it's been incidental or systematic is a different discussion i don't wanna get into that now for some reason there seems to be a huge debate about whether any israeli has ever sunk so low as as to target a civilian i don't know we've agreed both we've agreed on that i've just said that this has happened here okay and i think we've agreed on that i think what we're saying is it's not policy which is what you guys are implying that they kill civilians deliberately if i understand you correctly you're basically making the claim that none of these attacks could have happened without going through an entire chain of command strike cells that are involved in like drone attacks or plane attacks or yes my understanding of the israeli military and you could perhaps you've served in it you would know better it's actually a fairly chaotic organization no no that's not true especially not the air force extremely extremely organized the air force works in a very organized fashion as he says with lawyers chain of command and ultimately the pilot drops the bomb where he's told to drop it in protective edge was that two hundred two hundred strikes in like sixty seconds i think i think of the opening of protective edge like the yeah the coordination between the two thousand day for i think yeah the address is twenty fourteen but i'm just saying that the coordination in the military is is pretty quiet my my understanding of the israeli military it's very orderly is is that it's quite chaotic and there's also a lot of testimonies from israel but be that as it may okay i'm i'm prepared to accept both of your contentions that it's a a highly organized and disciplined force air force under any scenario is going to be more organized than the other branches and and you're saying such a strike would have been inconceivable well i'm not necessarily saying angazu i'm just saying that like that would have required okay your your basic rigorous intent for so many people yes you're i don't think good evidence is represented to say that that's your your basic claim is that we we we it would be fair to assume that such a strike could have only been carried out with multiple levels of authorization and and and signing off mhmm okay let's accept that for the sake of argument we have now seen incident after incident after incident after incident where entire families are vaporized in in single strikes who is in the families who lives in the house families no four next to the house families families families we have seen incident do you know that hamasniks weren't in that house do you know that their ammunition dumps were why do i have to prove a negative you're saying that they deliberately targeted well families if israel wanted to kill civilians in in in gaza they could have killed five hundred thousand by now with a number of strikes they've done the fact that they've only killed a certain small number thirty thousand is a small number small number in proportion thirty thousand small number in proportion over four months twelve thousand probably is an indication twelve thousand children is only twelve thousand children is only and if that's the case why is it i use the yeah you said only only no professor morris here's a question for you if we take every combat zone in the world for the past three years every combat zone in the world in vietnam americans killed a million people well you could have killed forty million i wasn't yeah i was again in the anti war movement so don't strap it million people of vietnam fine fine and and thirty million russians were killed so and during world war two so everything else is irrelevant okay not at all here's a question yeah stick to the point of morality professor morris here's a question it's very perplexing if you take every combat zone in the world for the past three years and you multiply the number of children killed by four every combat zone in the world you get gaza okay so when you said first supposed to prove i'm gonna you're a liar i'm a liar numbers in office to send everybody else i'm not lying in the numbers numbers though what is that those are mass numbers okay okay which may not be true fine they could invent any lying anything because you don't that they are a mendacious order in my day i know mendacious believe me you like what mendacious as in the israeli ministry of foreign affairs okay so here's the thing you say they could have killed five hundred thousand but they only killed only that's your words i'm not asking you killed thirty found it you believe that they deliberately targeted civilians they could have would have killed many many more the fact is that the delta mars professor mars for his and you don't understand for her story i don't want to understand israeli society don't want to i don't want to get inside their heads that's the problem here ninety percent of that a good a good a good a good historian a good historian tries to get into the heads of the very there's a limit the very the agony there's a limit when ninety percent when ninety percent of israelis think that israel is using enough or too little force in gaza i don't wanna get inside that head forty percent think that israel is using insufficient force in gaza i don't wanna get inside that head i don't wanna get inside the head of people who think they're using insufficient force story of pakistan population no against the population half of which is children i don't wanna get inside that head but here is the point because your partner wants to know the point you don't understand political constraints one of your ministers said let's drop an atomic bomb on you thought he really meant that he said it through you no no no no it was it was said in a sort of a professor lawrence questionable way he didn't say they should should drop himself today i'm not supporting he's an idiot boris this minister none other than israel's chief historian the famed justifiably famed benny morris thinks we should be dropping nuclear weapons on iran iran has for years its leaders for years have said we should destroy israel mhmm you agree with that they've said we should destroy israel israel must be destroyed you have you is that correct this is what the iranian leaders have been saying since khomeini i would say iranian leaders have sent mixed messages okay okay but some of them have said including super relevant khamenei if you don't know the evidence if you don't know the stop the genocide in gaza they have no genis so they have the right to access guardianship i support i know i selectively support international law when it agrees with you okay and then when it doesn't you decide to throw international law to the bin candidate if you like norm norm let me read what you said norm norm stop please norm just for me please mhmm just give me a sec you said that there's no genocide going on in gaza let me ask that clear question yeah the same question i asked on the hamas attacks is there from a legal philosophical moral perspective is there genocide going on in gaza today is there a genocide going on in gaza well in several years we will have a definitive response but at the moment question what has happened thus far is that on the twenty ninth of december the republic of south africa instituted proceedings against israel pursuant to the nineteen forty eight convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide south africa basically accused israel of perpetrating genocide in the gaza strip on the twenty sixth of january the the court issued its initial ruling the court at this stage is not making a determination on whether israel has or has not committed genocide so just as it has not found israel guilty it certainly also hasn't found israel innocent what the court had to do at this stage was take one of two decisions either south africa's case was the the equivalent of a frivolous lawsuit and dismiss it and close the proceedings or it had to determine that south africa presented a plausible case that israel was violating its obligations under the genocide convention and that it would on that basis hold a full hearing now a lot of people have looked at the court's ruling of the twenty sixth of january and focused on the fact that the court did not order a ceasefire i actually wasn't expecting it to order a ceasefire and i wasn't surprised that it didn't because in the other cases that that the court has considered most prominently bosnia and myanmar it also didn't order a ceasefire and south africa in requesting a ceasefire also didn't ask the court to render an opinion on the legitimacy or lack thereof of israel's of israel's military operation from my perspective the key issue on the twenty sixth of january was whether the court would simply dismiss the case or decide to proceed with it and it decided to proceed we don't know what to do and i think that's enormously i think that's enormously said they committed genocide you already said they committed genocide i also like it i committing genocide but if i hope that works allow allow me allow me that's correct now i i don't run away so norman you did say israel committing genocide finish well the end of the story is you specifically asked whether i think israel is committing genocide i explained formally there is no finding and as you said we won't know for a number of years and i think there's legitimate questions to be raised i mean in the bosnia case which i think all four of us would agree was clearly a case of genocide the court determined mean by the service yes in in the bosnia case the court determined that of all the evidence placed before them only srebrenica qualified as genocide and all the other atrocities committed did not qualify as genocide you know international law is a developing organism i don't know how the court is going to respond in this case so i wouldn't take it as a foregone conclusion how the court is going to respond but my has determined already i have too because you're asking my personal opinion personal opinion is also true so as a matter of law i want to state very clearly it has not been determined and won't be determined for several years based on my observations and and the evidence before me i would say it's indisputable that israel is engaged in a genocidal assault against the palestinian people in regards to the strip plo line yeah with the program the plo is long past what what okay the palestine i as as as you were saying genocide is is is not a body count genocide consists of two elements the destruction of a people in whole or in part so in other words you can commit genocide by killing thirty thousand people it doesn't have well five probably is below the threshold numbers yes but i think thirty thousand crosses the threshold and not reaching five hundred thousand is probably relevant and the second element is there has to be an intent in other words and you believe there's an intent yes i think if there is any other plausible reason for why all these people are being murdered it's not genocide and as far as intent is concerned hiding behind a human shield you don't think that's the reason for them being killed well let's get the intent part out of the way first south africa's forget south africa they don't have the party well i'd i'd like to finish i'm like i'm a and a government that's that's got nothing to do with any i think they're pro satan as well last time no they're pro hamas you know for some reason you don't have a problem with people being pro israeli at the time of of this but if they support palestinians' right to life or self determination they get demonized and delegitimized as pro hamas supported an organization which murdered twelve hundred people deliberately that's my problem but but supporting a state that has murdered thirty thousand but they haven't because these are thirty thousand okay are basically used by the hamas in which the hamas want this wanted killed okay they wanted them killed alright if i could hamas wanted these people killed if i could just get you don't think they wanted them killed they provide them with shelters they build tunnels for their fighters but not one shelter for their own civilians you asked me about intent what does they want them killed okay you asked me about intent and the reason that i bought in the south african application is because it is actually exceptionally detailed on intent by quoting numerous sorts of idiotic ministers in israel well yeah including the prime minister the defense minister the chief of staff no he said i'm out according to asa kacher use the word a lot according to asa kacher if i this according to asa kacher the philosopher of the idea yeah he said that netanyahu was was a vowing genocide so he's an idiot so the he didn't say he's an idiot but he's yeah passed it so the the the reason i raised the south african application is twofold hamas or no hamas it's exceptionally detailed on the question of on the question of intent and secondly when when the international court of justice issues a ruling individual justices have have the right can give their own opinion yeah yeah and i found the german one to be the most interesting on on this specific question because he was basically saying that he didn't think south africa presented a persuasive case but he said their their section on intent was so overpowering that he felt he was left with no choice but to vote with with the majority so i think that answers the intent part of your question so for the icj case that south africa's brought i think there's a couple of things that need to be mentioned one is and i saw you two talk at length about this the plausibility standard is incredibly low the only thing we're looking for is a basic presentation of facts that make it conceivable possible that plausible plausible which legally this is obviously below criminal conviction below yes of course yeah below think of it as an indictment sure possibly maybe even a a lower level than even an indictment so plausibility is an incredibly low standard number one number two if you actually go through and you read the complaint that south africa filed i would say that if you go through the quotes and you even follow through to the source of the quotes the misrepresentation that south africa does and their case about all of these horrendous quotes in my opinion borders on criminal well sixteen icj judges disagree that's fine if sixteen icj judges disagree he must be incompetent you know they could be but she must be oh even the american judge she must have been awful incompetent if she was unable to see the misrepresentations that mister bunnell based on his wikipedia entry was able to find so this is based on the official icj report that was released i'm not sure if you've read the entire script or not i read every tweet ask did you go through and actually identify any of the sources for the underlying question actually brace yourself for this and moeen could confirm it mhmm yaniv kogan an israeli and jamie stern reiner half israeli they checked every single quote in the hebrew original and yaniv kogan love the guy he has terrifying powers of concentration he checked every single quote is that correct muinne and jamie checked every single quote in the english in the context and where there were any contextual questions they told us i think they found one yeah i think they found one so i do not believe that those sixteen fifteen judges was fifteen to two sixteen to two i think there are fifteen on the court plus two so it's seventeen so it's fifteen to two i don't think those fifteen judges were incompetent and i certainly don't believe the president of the court an american would allow herself to be duped okay well let's let's let's let me read you i did not read you one let me read one mister let me read it let me read you the copywriting alright i think i wanna read one let them read sure so this was taken from the from the south african complaint there's tons of these mhmm but so here's one in the in the complaint for the icj they said that on the twelfth of october twenty twenty three president isaac herzog made clear that israel was not distinguishing between militants and civilians in gaza correct stating in a press conference to foreign media in relation to palestinians in gaza over one million of whom are children quote quote it's an entire nation out there that is responsible yeah it is not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware not involved i saw that it's absolutely not true and we will fight until we break their backbone end quote if you actually go to the news article that they even state they even link it in their complaint the full context for the quote was quote it is an entire nation out there that is responsible it's not true this rhetoric about civilians not being aware not involved it's absolutely not true they could have risen up they could have fought against that evil regime which took over gaza in a coup d'etat but we are at war we are defending our homes we are protecting our homes that's the truth and when a nation protects its home it fights and we will fight until we break their backbone he acknowledged that many gazans had nothing to do with hamas but was adamant that others did quote i agree there are many innocent palestinians who don't agree with this but if you have a missile in your goddamn kitchen and you wanna shoot it at me am i allowed to defend myself we have to defend ourselves we have the right to do so this is not the same as saying there's no distinction between militants and civilians in gaza his statement here is actually fully compliant with international law to the letter because if you are storing milli military supplies in civilian areas these things become military targets and you're allowed to do proportionality assessments afterwards so this is supposed to be one of many quotes that they've shown that is supposed to demonstrate genocidal intent but it is very easily explained by military intent or by a conflict between two parties i saw that press conference wait let let me just say something all of this talk is a bit irrelevant because it sounds it may sound to the listeners that the the court in the hag has ruled that israel is committing genocide no i think it hasn't no it's just is going in the next few years to look at the whole stuff okay there has no idea about that no determination at all fine and as as stephen says some of the quotes are not exactly accurate quotes or taken out of all of us characterizations yes okay it is correct as muinne put it that at least seven several years before the court makes a determination and my guess is that it will determine there was no genocide we can all that's my guess that's not i'm just giving you my guess i can't predict i got it all wrong actually as muinne will attest i got it all wrong the first time i never thought the american judge would vote again would vote in favor of plausibility so you admit that you were wrong yeah of course i think i tell muin twice a day i was wrong about this and i was wrong about that i'm not wrong about the facts i try not to be but my speculations they can be wrong okay leaving that aside first of all as muin pointed out there's a difference between the legal decision by the ruling and an independent judgment now south africa was not filing a frivolous case that was eighty four pages it was sing even eighty four pages it was single spaced it takes an hour and a half to read it was not a massive case it was single spaced and had literally hundreds of footnotes it can still be frivolous with it's possible of course but this book wasn't yeah i read the report to tell you the truth i followed very closely everything that's been happening to october seventh i was mesmerized i couldn't believe the comprehensiveness of that particular report number two there are two quite respected judges excuse me there were two quite respected experts of international law sitting on the south african panel john dugard and von low vaughn low as you might know he argued the wall case in two thousand four before the international court of justice now they were not they were alleging genocide which in their view means the evidence in their minds we're not yet at the court the evidence in their minds compels the conclusion that genocide is being committed i am willing because i happen to know mister dugard personally and i've corresponded with von low i've heard their claim i've read the report i would say they make a very strong case but let's agree plausible now here's a question if somebody qualifies for an olympic team let's say a regional person qualifies for olympic team it doesn't mean they're gonna be on the olympic team it doesn't mean they're gonna win a gold medal a a silver medal or a brown bronze medal can swim that's what you're saying no i would say that's a very high bar you're saying they can swim to even qualify to swim well enough to have a realistic prospect winning a medal so to even make it to plausible that is not true that is not what plausible means it is absolutely not you're dead wrong mister barelli please don't teach me about the english language so the declaration judge appoint said said said not asked in the present phase disqualifying the fine the court is not asked at this present phase of the proceedings to determine whether south africa's allegations of genocide are well founded they're not well founded they're not even well founded the point is that you said that plausible was a high standard it is absolutely not it is a misrepresentation of the strength of the case against israel just like the majority of the quotes they have in this case are and also you said it was an extremely well founded case they spend like one fourth of all of the quotations some even pulled from the goldstone report that try to that actually deal with the intent part mhmm which is by the way i think you guys i don't know if you use the phrase the that the intentional part of genocide i don't know that term the the i think it's i think it's called it is the most important part of genocide which is proving the special it is a highly special intent to commit genocide it's possible that in israel that's mens rea no the mens rea they yes i understand the state of mind but the the and for genocide there is it's called dolo esmeciales it's a highly special intent did you read the case yeah it is a highly special intent to be the case of genocide yes please stop displaying your imbecility okay i'm sorry you think the declaration of the judges imbecility put on public display that you're a moron at least have the self possession to shut up did i read the case my display on i read the case around four times i read all of the the the the majority opinion the declarations i read aram barak's declaration then why are you lying and saying plausible is a high standard because i said even reaching the benchmark of plausibility is a very high standard in the world it's the equivalent of a regional player qualifying for an olympics it's still two steps removed you may not be on the team and you may not get a medal but to get qualified which in this context is the equivalent of plausible you must be doing something pretty horrible but the court as it happens course as it happens professor lawrence there wasn't a benefit that's what the court will rule remember what i just told you the court will rule the court even around when the court reaches its final decision why why they'll take a long long time two years three no i don't think they'll take two or three years i mean the bosnia which was admittedly a special type of case because they were accusing serbia of sponsoring the bosnian serbs that took i think seventeen years from ninety i assume they'll take two or three years but the point you're making so this is illegal this yeah yeah horrible must be happening to even achieve it's horrible it's a war yeah i know it's true horrible but i think they weren't they weren't rendering a ruling on a war they were rendering a ruling on the genocide and i think i think the suggestion and they said it was plausible they also said it's plausible that israel is committing a military operation as well yeah but i think the problem with with your characterization is you're saying in so many words the south africans basically only have to show up in court with a coherent statement that is correct into today's atmosphere that's probably correct they they needed to do a lot more not more they need they needed to they needed to persuade today's atmosphere the american judge they need to persuade judges go according to what the majority want want to hear yeah but they need president they needed to persuade the court that it was worth investing several years of their time in hearing this case to us they're they're well paid whether they take this case or not i mean you know they have a they have a full docket whether they accept or reject this case and i i think i don't think we should remember what i just said they won't rule there was genocide remember what i said also i recommend people actually read the case and follow through a lot of the quotes that they just don't show genocide on the right the head the israeli minister of finance on the eighth of october twenty twenty three this is taken from the icj this is from south africa's submission besalel smotrich i can't read this stated that is smotrich there you go okay at a meeting of the israeli cabinet that quote we need to deal a blow that hasn't been seen in fifty years and take down gaza end quote but again if you click through and you read the source their own linked source it says as per this own source quote the powerful finance minister settler leader besalom smotrik i can't pronounce this demanded at the cabinet meeting late saturday that the army quote hit hamas brutally and not take the matter of the captives into significant consideration end quote quote in war as in war you have to be brutal end quote he was quoted as saying quote we need to deal a blow that hasn't been seen in fifty years and take down gaza end quote you can't strip the quotation of hamas a entity that you're out there with and then you and then there's genocidal intent that's not how i was that's not genocidal attack hey so when the ukrainians say when the ukrainians say we need to defeat russia take the donald no when ukraine says we need to defeat russia is that genocidal they mean killing all russian citizens professor morris here's another one it's ridiculous when the defense yeah ridiculous yes ridiculous the american judge he also doesn't determine policy that's the american judge at the end of the the american judge read you are holding the american judge to you know well she was the president yes he'll look she was the authority when it agreed to him and we won't deal with the actual facts of the matter ever the american judge read several of the quotes look at the american okay supreme court today they may support okay look shows you how we're getting the judges professor morris without going too far afield if you heard a statement by the defense minister the defense minister said we are going to prevent any food water fuel or electricity from entering gaza that he he wanted to make did israel do that okay no i'm i'm i'm wondering what he said i i'm asking you isn't israeli government policy but we're talking about statements now intent how would you interpret that after twelve hundred of your citizens are murdered the way they were i would expect extreme statements by lots of politicians but but but you're by lots of politicians but you don't accept extreme palestinian statements but you don't accept what he said is an israeli policy but you don't they let in water they let in gas i'm sure that don't accept but you don't accept extreme palestinian statements after they lost their entire country not just twelve hundred people that's a good point no no it's a good point and on that on on that moment brief moment of agreement let's just take a quick pause we need a smoke break you know water break you know bathroom break gaza it's not a genocide statement russia is a genocide statement down gaza war with iraq and we wanted to destroy iraq that was a genocide statement there's a reason why genocide is so is such an importantly guarded concept and it's not to to condemn every nation that goes to war i but you do know i don't know how to spell my name are you not judging intentionally yes i made you into an italian law i'm not sure by your solicitude for international law you should try learning it sometime it would help you sort out a lot of the civilian deaths unfortunately fifteen judges disagree you could keep citing the judges you you should actually try reading the actual statements this is tiring how you you've invited us to a tiring session yeah there you go how are you guys doing okay okay there's a there are major things to discuss here not just one what some court is doing and they're right judge in two years' time yes okay so what you just said is my whole one of the reasons why i feel so strongly about this particular conflict is because there are really important things to discuss but they will never be discussed they're not being discussed we're not gonna talk about like like area a b and c or what a transference of territory instead we're gonna talk about apartheid we're not gonna talk about you know the differences in how do you conduct war in an urban environment where people we're just gonna talk about genocide we're not gonna talk about no no no what's a good solution for the palestinians we're just gonna say ethnic cleansing possible to talk be productive over the next two hours and talk about solutions about solutions i have no idea what to say i mean there there i don't see any solutions on you know if you wanted a positive end to this discussion which is what you said at the beginning i can't contribute to this because i i'm pessimistic i don't see anywhere any way forward here but the lack of the solution is is easy the reason why the solution is hard is because the histories and the myths are completely there's a different factual record right one of the things would be good to talk about solutions where the future is going back in all the times it has failed so every time but even at that we're probably not gonna agree he's gonna say you could write that i can can predict the whole line he's gonna say from ninety three to ninety nine he's gonna say israel didn't adhere to the oslo courts ever settlement expansion continued raids happened into the west bank that there was never a legitimate that netanyahu came in and violated the the y memorandum the transference the he's gonna say all of this and he's not gonna bring up anything in the palestinian side and then for camp david he's gonna say that yeah that arafat was trying that the maps and the territorial exchange wasn't good enough that they were asking palestinians to make all the concessions that israel would have that gets yeah well but lay it all off lay it up you do so quickly you know yeah i know yeah anyhow my future book should interest you guys oh what are you working on it no not working on it's actually going to come out ah it deals with israeli and arab atrocities war crimes i call them in the forty eight war that's the book yeah just deals with that subject is this because i know you've also talked about the closure of the archives and stuff well it's it's marginal they do it deals with that as well but yeah they have tried to seal off documents which had already used and seen now they don't let people see them that's happened but it's marginal in terms of its effect on on on were the british archives useful for you for this new book well for this list it's mostly israeli archives the british and the americans and un did deal with these subjects but not not as well as israeli documents what's your casualty count for deir yassin it's about a hundred i think there's agreement on that by israelis and arabs hundred hundred and five because before they were they used to say two forty five and two fifty four those were the figures the british and the arabs and the haganah agreed on at the at the beginning because the red cross i think was the one that first put out that number i don't remember maybe it was what's his name jacques de rainier or maybe yeah yeah maybe he he came up with that number but it was just they didn't count they didn't count bodies they just threw the number out and everybody was happy to blame the irgun and the lehi for you know killing more arabs than actually well and they and they put it to good use as well well they said that it helped to precipitate more evacuations so they were not big in it as yeah yeah yeah they also use that in there yeah yep yeah so first of all thank you for that heated discussion about the present i would love to go back into history in a way that informs what we can look for in a as a by way of hope for the future so when has in israel and palestine have we been closest to something like a peace settlement to something that like where both sides would be happy and enable the flourishing of both peoples well my my from my knowledge of the hundred and twenty years or so of conflict the closest i think the two sides have been to reaching some sort of settlement appears to have been in the year two thousand when barack and then subsequently clinton offered a two state settlement to plo palestinian authority chairman yasser arafat and arafat seemed to waver he didn't immediately reject what was being offered but ultimately came down at the end of camp david in july two thousand he came down against the proposals and the clinton who said he wouldn't blame him later blamed arafat for bringing down the summit and not reaching a solution there but i i think they're on the table certainly in the clinton parameters of december two thousand which followed the proposals by barack in july the palestinians were offered the best deal they're ever going to get from israel unless israel is destroyed and then there'll just be a palestinian arab state but the best deal that israel could ever offer them they were offered which essentially was ninety five percent of the west bank east jerusalem half of the old city of jerusalem some sort of joint control of the temple mount and the gaza strip of course in full and the palestinians said no to this deal and nobody really knows why arafat said no that is some people think he was trying to hold out for slightly better terms but my my reading is that he was constitutionally psychologically incapable of signing off on a two state deal meaning acceptance of the existence of a jewish state this was really the problem of israel or of a jewish state of a jewish state the jewish state of israel he wasn't willing to share palestine with the jews and put his name to that i i think he just couldn't do it and that that's my reading but some people say it was because the terms were insufficient and he was willing but was waiting for slightly better terms i don't i don't i don't buy that i don't think so but other people disagree with me on this what what do you think well just briefly in response arafat formally recognized israel in in nineteen ninety three yeah totally i don't i don't think actually that in two thousand two thousand one a genuine resolution was on offer because i think the maximum israel was prepared to offer admittedly more than it had been prepared to offer in the past fell short of the minimum that the palestinians considered to be a reasonable two state settlement bearing in mind that as of nineteen forty nine israel controlled seventy eight percent of the british mandate of palestine the palestinians were seeking a stay on the remaining twenty two percent and this was apparently too much for israel my my response to your question would be wait wait they were being offered something like twenty two or twenty one percent they they were being offered i think less than a withdrawal to the nineteen sixty seven borders with mutual and minor and reciprocal land swaps and the just resolution of the refugee problem was one of the questions yes you know i i worked for a number of years with international crisis group and my boss at the time was rob malley who was one of the american officials present at yesterday thrown out of the state department or whatever the point i'm the point i wanna make about rob was he wrote i think a very perceptive article in two thousand one in the new york review of books i know that you and ehud barak have had a debate with them but i think he gives a very compelling reason of why and how camp david failed but rather than going into that i'll you wrote that together with the hussein arao hussein arao yes who was not at camp david yes but in response to your question i think there could have been a real possibility of israeli palestinian and arab israeli peace in the mid nineteen seventies in the wake of the nineteen seventy three october war i'll recall that in nineteen seventy one moshe dayan israel's defense minister at the time full of triumphalism about israel's victory in nineteen sixty seven speaking to a group of israeli military veterans stated you know if i had to choose between sharm el sheikh without peace or peace without sharmesheikh this is referring to the resort in in in egyptian sinai which was an under israeli occupation dayan said i will choose for sharm el sheikh without peace then the nineteen seventy three war came along and i think israeli calculations began to change very significantly and i think it was in that context that had there been a joint us soviet push for an arab israeli and israeli palestinian resolution that incorporated both an israeli withdrawal to the nineteen sixty seven lines and the establishment of a palestinian state in in the occupied territories i think it there was a very reasonable prospect for that being achieved it ended up being aborted i think for several reasons and ultimately the egyptian president anwar sadat decided for reasons we can discuss later to launch a separate unilateral initiative for israeli egyptian rather than arab israeli peace and i think once that set in motion the prospects disappeared because israel essentially saw its most powerful adversary removed from the equation and felt that this would give it a free hand in the occupied territories also in lebanon to get rid of the plo and so on so you know and you ask when were we closest and i can't give you an answer of when we were closest i can only tell you when i think we we could have been close and that was a that was a lost opportunity if we look at the situation today you know there's been a lot of discussion about a two state settlement my own view and i've i've written about this i don't i don't buy the arguments of the naysayers that we have passed the so called point of no return with respect to a two state settlement certainly if you look at the israeli position in the occupied territories i would argue it's more tenuous than was the french position in algeria in nineteen fifty four than was a british position in ireland in nineteen sixteen than was a ethiopian position in eritrea in nineteen ninety and so as a matter of practicality as a matter of principle i do think the establishment of a palestinian state in in the occupied territories remains realistic i think the question that we now need to ask ourselves it's one i'm certainly asking myself since october seventh and looking at israel's genocidal campaign but also looking at larger questions is it desirable can you have peace with what increasingly appears to be an irrational genocidal state that seeks to confront and resolve each and every political challenge with violence and that reacts to its failure to achieve solutions to political challenges with violence by applying even more violence that has an insatiable lust for palestinian territory that you know a a genocidal apartheid state that seems increasingly incapable of even conceiving of peaceful coexistence with with the other people on that land so i'm very pessimistic that a solution is possible i look at i grew up in western europe in the long shadow of the second world war i think we can all agree that there could have been no peace in europe had certain regimes on that continent not been removed from power i look at southeast asia in the late 1970s and i think we're all agreed that there could not have been peace in that region had the khmer rouge not been ousted i look at southern africa during the nineteen nineties and i think we can all be agreed that had the white minority regimes of that ruled zimbabwe and south africa not been dismantled there could not have been peace in that region and although i think it's worth having a discussion i do think it's now a legitimate question to ask can there be peace without dismantling the zionist regime and i make a very clear distinction between the israeli state and its institutions on the one hand and the israeli people who i think regardless of our discussion about the history i think you can now talk about an israeli people and a people that have developed rights over time and a formula for peaceful coexistence with them will need to be found which is a separate matter from dismantling the israeli state and its institutions and again i haven't reached clear conclusions about this except to say as a practical matter i think a two state settlement remains feasible but i think there are very legitimate questions about its desirability and about whether peace can be achieved in the middle east with the persistence of an irrational genocidal apartheid regime particularly because israeli society is beginning to develop many extremely extremely distasteful supremacist dehumanizing aspects that i think also stand in the way of coexistence that are being fed by this regime so if you look back into history when were we closest to peace and do you draw any hope from any of them i feel like in two thousand i feel like the deal that was present at least at the end of the tabas summit i think in terms of what israel i think had the appetite to give and what the palestinians would have gotten would have definitely been the most agreeable between the two parties i don't know if in seventy three i'm not sure if the appetite would have ever been there for the arab states to negotiate alongside the palestinians i know that in jordan there was no love for the palestinians after you know nineteen seventy after black september i know that sadat had no love for the palestinians due to their associate with association with the muslim brotherhood's attempted assassinations in egypt sorry what plo and the muslim brotherhood sadat was upset because there were attempted assassinations by people and oh no an assassination it was a personal friend of his yusuf al sabai i can't pronounce that he was assassinated by a palestinian killed by the abunidal organization sure yeah admittedly yeah he says as much belongs to the sonder group not gilo directly but i think that there was a history of the palestinians sometimes fighting with their neighboring states that were hosting them if they weren't getting the political concessions they wanted the assassination of the jordanian king in 'fifty one might be another example of that in jordan it feels like over a long period of time it feels like the palestinians have been kind of told from the neighboring arab states that if they just continue to enact violence whether in israel or abroad that eventually a state will materialize somehow i don't think it's gotten them any closer to a state if anything i think it's taken them farther and farther and farther away from one and i think as long as the hyperbolic language is continually employed internationally the idea that israel is committing a genocide the idea that there is an apartheid the idea that they live in a concentration camp all of these words i think further the narrative for the palestinians that israel is an evil state that needs to be dismantled you said as much about the institution at least of the zionist government israel's government is probably not going anywhere all of the other surrounding arab states have accepted that or at least most of them down in the gulf egypt and jordan have accepted that the palestinians need to accept it too the the israeli state where the state apparatus is not going anywhere and at some point they need to realize like hey we need a leader that's gonna come out and represent us represent all of us is willing to take political risks is willing to negotiate some lasting peace for us and it's not gonna be the international community or some invocation of international law or some invocation of morality or justice that's going to extricate us from this conflict it's gonna take some actual difficult political maneuvering on the ground of accepting israel of accepting israel yeah which they formally did in nineteen ninety three which they formally did in nineteen ninety three yeah but then no no lasting peace came after that in two thousand no because nineteen ninety three was not a peace agreement sure the oslo accords were were an interim final solution were an interim yeah an interim agreement and palestinians actually began clamoring for commencing the the permanent status resolutions on schedule and the israelis kept delaying them in fact they only began i believe in ninety nine under american pressure on on the israelis and i think you're being a bit one-sided both sides didn't fulfill the promise of oslo and the steps needed for oslo there was palestinian terrorism which accompanied israel's expansion of settlements and other things the two things fed each other and led to what happened in two thousand which was a breakdown of the talks altogether when the palestinians said no but i i think there's a i i don't i don't agree incidentally with this definition of israel or the israeli state as a apartheid it's not there is some sort of apartheid going on in the west bank the israeli regime itself is not an apartheid regime this is nonsense by any definition of apartheid which well by by the formal definition i think it qualifies no it doesn't qualify apartheid is a race based distinction between different segments of the population correct and some of them don't have any representation at all like the blacks in south africa that's not it that's not it that's not it in israel in israel itself the the minority the arabs do have representation do have rights and so on i don't think israel is also genocidal i don't think it's been genocidal it wasn't so in forty eight it wasn't so in sixty seven and it hasn't been recently in my view and talk about dismantling israel and that's what you're talking about is i think steven said it correctly is counterproductive it just pushes israelis further away from willing to give palestinians anything please norm tell me you have something optimistic to say optimistic to say i even though i agree i've thought about it a lot and i agree with muin's analysis i'm not really in the business of punditry i rather look at the historical record where i feel more comfortable and i feel on terra firma so i'd like to just go through that i don't quite i agree and i disagree with muin on the seventy three issue after the nineteen seventy three war it was clear that israel was surprised by what happened during the war and it took a big hit the estimates are i don't know what numbers you use but i hear between two and three thousand israeli soldiers were killed during the nineteenth it was twenty five hundred yeah twenty seven hundred okay so i got it right yeah i read different numbers that's you know it's a very large number of israelis who were killed there were moments at the beginning of the war where there was a fear that this might be it no no there wasn't there wasn't there wasn't there's a everybody forgets israel's atomic weaponry i know but so how could they have been defeated didn't diana talk about the collapse of the threat temple but then but there was hysterical weapons they wanted a story i don't know but we're talking about perception yeah i'm not i'm not i can't tell you if he was hysterical or not no he wasn't but dave was room with him where dave was but i'm just saying let's not bogged down on that the war is over and when president carter comes into power carter was an extremely smart guy jimmy carter extremely smart guy and he was very fixed on details extreme he was probably the most impressive of modern american presidents in my opinion by a wide margin and he was determined to resolve the conflict on a on a big scale on the arab israeli scale on the palestinian scale issue he wouldn't go past what he called the palestinian homeland he went palestinian national home and the palestinian national home he wouldn't go as far as the palestinian state i'm not going to go into the details of that i i don't think realistically given the political balance of forces that was going to happen but that's a separate issue let's get to the issue at hand namely what is the obstacle or what has been the obstacle since the early 1970s since roughly nineteen seventy four the palestinians have accepted the two state settlement in the june nineteen sixty seven border now as it got as more pressure was exerted on israel because the palestinians seemed reasonable the israelis to quote the israeli political scientist avner yaniv he's since passed from the scene he said yaniv in his book dilemmas of security he said that the big palestinian big israeli fear was what he called the palestinian peace offensive that was their worry that the palestinians were becoming too moderate and unless you understand that you can't understand the june nineteen eighty two lebanon war the purpose of the june nineteen eighty two lebanon war was to liquidate the plo in southern lebanon because they were too moderate the palestinian peace offensive i'm going to have to fast forward there are many events there is the first intifada then there's the oslo accord and let's now go to the the the heart of the issue namely the the two thousand two thousand one negotiations well the negotiations are divided into three parts for the sake of listeners there's camp david in july two thousand there are the clinton parameters in december two thousand and then there are negotiations in taaba in egypt taaba in egypt in two thousand one those are the three phases now i have studied the record probably to the point of insanity because there are so many details you have to master i'll vouch for that i love the insanity part yeah i actually i will vouch for it i will personally vouch for it there is one extensive record from that whole period from two thousand to you could say two thousand seven and that is what came to be called the palestine papers which are about fifteen thousand pages of all the records of the negotiations i have read through all of them every single page and this is what i find if you look at shlomo ben ami's book which i have with me prophets without honor it's his last book he says going into camp david that means july going into camp david july two thousand he said the israelis were willing to return about not return but will withdraw from ninety relinquish ninety two percent of the west bank ben ami was at camp david yeah ben i he was at tabah oh yeah he was also at camp david they wanted israel wanted to keep all the major settlement blocks it wanted to keep roughly eight percent of the west bank they were allowing for you put it at eighty four to ninety percent in your books they put it at roughly ninety two percent israel was fully picked up how you calculate yeah that often depends what stage camp david because there were two weeks i'm yeah the the i'll get to that proposals change during that two israel wants to keep all the major settlement blocks means the border area of the west bank well not the border we have ariel we have male adumim we have is i said it's condoleezza rice called ariel she said it was a dagger into the heart of the west bank so they want to keep eight percent of the land they want to keep the settlement blocks they want to keep eighty percent of the settlers they will not budge an inch on the question of refugees to quote ehud barak in the article he coauthored with you in the new york review of books we will accept and i think the quote's accurate no moral legal or historical responsibility for what happened to the refugees so forget about even allowing refugees to return we accept no moral legal or historical responsibility for the refugees and on jerusalem they wanted to keep large parts of jerusalem now how do we judge who is reasonable and who is not then ami says i think the israeli offer was reasonable that's how he sees it but what is the standard of reasonable my standard is what does international law say international law says the settlements are illegal israel wants to keep all the settlement blocks fifteen judges all fifteen in the wall decision in two thousand four in july two thousand four all fifteen judges including the american judge bergenthal ruled the settlements are illegal under international law they want to keep eighty percent of the settlers under international law all the settlers are illegal in the west bank they want to keep large parts of east jerusalem but under international law east jerusalem is occupied palestinian territory that's what the international not palestinian because there was no palestine okay under been a palestinian state how could we be palestinian i listened patiently to you sorry under international law if you read the decision all territory they're not two thousand four wall decision all territory beyond the green line which includes east jerusalem is occupied palestinian territory except in the golan heights the designated unit according to the international court of justice the designated unit for palestinian self determination and they they deny any right whatsoever on the right of return the maximum i don't wanna go into the details now the maximum formal offer was by ehud omar in two thousand eight he offered five thousand refugees could return under what was called family reunification five thousand in the course of five years and no recognition of any israeli responsibility so if you use as the baseline what the un general assembly has said and what the international court of justice has said if you use that baseline international law by that baseline all the concessions came from the palestinian side every single concession came from the palestinian site none came from the israeli site they may have accepted less than the with the than what they wanted but it was still beyond what international law allocated to them now you say to the palestinians allocated to palestinians yes thank you for the clarification now about arafat like the mufti never liked the guy i i think that was one of the only disagreements muin and i had when arafat passed you were a little sentimental i was not never liked the guy but politics you don't have to like the guy there was no question nobody argues it that whenever the negotiations started up the palestinians just kept saying the same things no and no they kept saying no no professor morris with due respect incorrect they kept saying international legitimacy international law un resolutions they said we already gave you what you what the law required we gave that in nineteen eighty eight november nineteen eighty eight and then ratified again at oslo in nineteen ninety three and they said now we want what was promised us under international law and that was the one point where everybody in the other side agreed clinton don't talk to me about international law livni during the omar administration she said i studied international law i don't believe in international law every single member on the other side they didn't want to hear from international law and to my thinking that that is the only reasonable baseline for trying to resolve the conflict and israel has along with the us when has international law been relevant to any conflict facing the world that's why over the last hundred years that's why the palestinians had to recognize israel because that's international law yeah but international law is meaningless that was un resolution two four two by international law or in accordance with international law professor morris for argument's sake let's agree on that strictly for argument's sake what's the alternative dennis ross said we're going to decide who gets what on the basis of needs so he says israel needs this israel needs that israel needs that dennis ross decided to be the philosopher king he's going to decide on the basis of needs well if you asked me since gaza is one of the densest places on earth it needs a it needs it needs part of cyanide it needs a nice big chunk of cyanide not cyanide that's what it actually needs okay i i don't even wanna go there it needs a nice big chunk but i have to accept international law says no okay international law is irrelevant now begumis says i think the israeli offer was reasonable okay that's and he's a reasonable guy that's your he seems to even though okay i know him to go there i've debated him and partly agree with you but who decides what's reasonable i think the international community in its political incarnation the general assembly the security council all those un security council resolutions saying the settlements are illegal annexation of east jerusalem international court of justice that to me is a reasonable standard and by that standard the palestinians were asked to make concessions which i consider unreasonable or the international community considers it unreasonable i think that the issue is when you apply international law or international standards i i wouldn't say what benny moore says that they're irrelevant but i think that these have to be seen as informing the conversation i don't think these are the final shape of the conversation i don't think historically israel has ever negotiated within the strict bounds whether we're talking resolution two four two whether we're talking about any general assembly resolutions that's just not how these negotiations tend to go you might consider international opinion on things but at the end of the day it's the bilateral negotiations oftentimes historically started in secret independent of the international community that end up shaping what the final agreements look like i think the issue with this broad appeal to international law is again going back to my earlier point about all of the euphemistic words all it simply does is drive palestinian expectations up to a level that is never going to be satisfied for instance you can throw that icj opinion all you want it was an advisory opinion that came in two thousand four how palestinians gained more or less land since that two thousand four advisory opinion was issued so how would your standard be then both sides have to have a delegation that confronts each other and they assess the realistic conditions on the ground and and they try to figure out within the confines of international law and then what both sides are reasonable for but like for instance this statement of like full with retreat from the west bank what is it four hundred thousand settlers how many settlers live in the west bank now probably half a million yeah you're gonna be thinking that include the jerusalem suburbs yeah four or five hundred thousand people are never thousand with the jerusalem suburbs perhaps sure yeah there is no cost half a million people are jerusalem not settlements i know that but that's not what the law the law calls it null and void yeah let let me we can say we can say whatever we want until we're blue in the face but like there's half a million israeli people are not being expelled from waste it's not gonna happen you're basically saying if i understand correctly there's only one way to resolve this and that is through direct bilateral negotiation probably yeah okay so or ideally but i've taken over your house okay you're not gonna go to the police because you know the law is of only of limited value so you come over and sit in what is now my living room that used to be your living room and we negotiate the problem there is that you're not gonna get anything unless i agree to it and standards and and norms and and law and all the rest of it be damned so you need to take into account that when you're advocating bilateral negotiations that effectively that gives each of the parties veto power and in the current circumstances the palestinians have already recognized israel they have they have wait what you keep bringing that up like significant concession and i don't and even if even it's not even true it doesn't but it doesn't the recognition from palestine isn't doing anything for you're you're you're hamas totally rejected i'm not talking about hamas hamas is the majority in the among the palestinian people they won the elections in two thousand and six actually they they won a majority of the seats yes exactly they didn't win a majority of votes opinion poll today says the majority of palestinians that sounds right support the hamas that sounds right the hamas absolutely rejects israel but but so if if arafat in two thousand and three nineteen ninety three or whatever issued a sort of recognition and what's the sort of recognition okay a recognition of israel it does it's meaningless it's meaningless it's meaningless any anyhow i don't believe that arafat was sincere about it does it matter what you or i think of what you do and that does matter okay so matter but hamas says no and hamas is the majority today years so so for years the israeli and us demand was that the palestinians recognize two four two and three three eight they did but you're saying okay we demanded that they do this but it was meaningless when they did it because it was then the then the demand was that tactical thing yes then the demand was is the plo recognizes real tactical okay we demanded that they did this and they did it but it's meaningless and they never changed their chart of the plo you may remember that in fact in nineteen supposedly abrogated the old charter but never came up with a new one no but there's no new charter in nineteen ninety six and faruk kadhoomi said of course the old charter is still in yes in force yes yes but the point is you know the palestinians' demands are constantly made of them and when they israel and when they exceed to those demands they're then told actually what you did is meaningless so here's a new set of demands i mean you know it's like a hamster set of demands it's like a hamster let me let me let me tell you what the whole line told if you run fast enough you'll get out of cage no no the bottom line is that israel would like a palestinian sadat it wants the palestinians i i would listen listen just let me just really a worst case scenario okay let me just yeah because they shot sadat but anyway the the the the israelis want for good reason want the palestinians israelis want the palestinians to actually accept the legitimacy of the state of israel and the zionist project and then live side by side with them in two states that's what the israelis i don't even know if it's true today and what is the formal position of of of this israeli government no no i'm saying i don't know if it exists today it's pre its predecessor and its predecessor and its predecessor come on that's what israelis want they want this change of psyche of psyche among the palestinians has an interesting if that doesn't happen there won't be a palestinian mean but president muin has an interesting point because he has international because i've i've found i've found i know you wanna i know you wanna forget it just like you wanna forget the genocide charge i know you wanna forget that well the palestinians wanna forget it too and it doesn't suit them as well right but here's the problem and it's exactly the problem that mouin just brought up now i read carefully your book one state two states with all due respect absolutely a disgrace coming coming from you coming from you most reviews didn't agree with you yeah coming from you was like you wrote it in your sleep it's nothing compared to what you wrote before i don't know why you did it in my opinion you ruined your reputation not totally but you undermined it with that book but let's get to the issue that muin wrote here's what you said you said formally you said yes it's true the palestinians recognize israel but then you said viscerally in their hearts they don't they didn't really recognize israel so i thought to myself how does professor morrison no no what's in the hearts of palestinians i don't know i was i was explained i was i was surprised as a historian you would be talking about what's lurking in the hearts of palestinians but then you said something which was really interesting you said even if in their hearts they accepted israel you said quote rationally they could never accept israel because they got nothing they had this beautiful palestine and now they're reduced to just a few pieces a few parcels of land so they will never accept it so yes so you said there's no way they can accept it no i i would say that as well yeah the two states have been so as proposed everything that's making sense exactly as moline said you keep moving the goalpost no no no no until we reach the point where we realize according to benny morris there can be a solution so why don't you just say that outright why don't you say it outright according to you the palestinians can never be reasonable because according to you they want all of palestine you're according to you they couldn't possibly they couldn't possibly agree to a two state summon because it's such a lousy settlement that's what you said palestine because you but you said rationally they couldn't accept it not their feelings it's both you said rational you went from formally viscerally rationally so now we're reaching the point where according to benny morris the palestinians can't be reasonable because reasonably they have to reject two states they won't call of palestine is absolutely correct there's no way to resolve the problem according to your logic he said that himself he said they should dismantle israel i'm totally not i'm what i what i said convince dismantle israel what i said and and i've and i've written i'm glad you didn't deny it i've i've i've written extensively on this issue on on why a two state settlement is still feasible and i came out in support of that proposition perhaps in my heart you know you can see that i was just bullshitting but that's what i actually wrote that was a number of years ago and and just as a matter of historical record beginning in the early nineteen seventies there was fierce debate within the palestinian national movement about whether to accept or reject and and there were three schools of thought there was one that would accept nothing less than the total liberation of of palestine there was a second that accepted what was called the establishment of a fighting national authority on palestinian soil which they saw as the begin as a springboard for the total liberation of palestine and there was a third school that believed that under current dynamics and so on that that they should go for a two state settlement and and our friend and correspondent kauter loerse has written a very perceptive article on when the plo already in nineteen seventy six came out in open support of a two state resolution at the security council plo accepted it israel of course rejected it but the resolution didn't pass because the us and the uk vetoed it it was both of them i think it was nine to five okay yeah but but fact of the matter is that the plo came to accept a two state settlement why they did it i think is irrelevant and subsequently the plo acted on the basis of seeking to achieve a two state settlement the reason i think and i think norm you've written about this the reason that arafat was so insistent on getting minimally acceptable terms for a two state settlement at camp david and afterwards was precisely because he knew that once he signed that was all the palestinians were going to get if his intention had been you know i'm not accepting israel i simply want the springboard he would have accepted a palestinian state in jericho but he didn't he insisted i've never understood he should've logically accepted the springboard and then from there launched his next state understand he should've done that international law would put a real constraint on him no but all of a sudden accepted it was over he was incapable of signing well i know all that if that's you're right that he should should have accepted it but if you're correct yeah okay that that he was really out to all of them eliminate israel then then he wouldn't have cared about the borders he wouldn't have cared about what the thing said about refugees he would have gotten a sovereign state and used that to achieve that purpose springboard but but i think it was precisely because he recognized that he was not negotiating for a springboard he was negotiating permanent status that he was such a stickler about the details the second just as a factual matter he wasn't such a stickler when they asked him how many refugees the numbers it was a principle rather than the numbers principle he said i would be pragmatic about it yes and the numbers that were used at annapolis were between one hundred and two hundred fifty thousand refugees over ten years that was the number arafat when he was asked at camp david he kept saying i care about the lebanese the palestinian refugees in lebanon which came to about three hundred thousand priority which was a large concession from the whether you accept the number or not that's he wasn't talking about six million he was talking about between a hundred and two hundred fifty thousand over ten years now the best offer that came from the palestinians excuse me the best offer that came from israel was the omar offer can we just pretend like we didn't all lay out the exceptionally pessimistic view of a two state hold on a second two state solution let's pretend that in five years in ten years a a two state peace settlement is reached and and as historians you'll still be here writing about it twenty years from now how would it have happened i think that historically i think that the big issue is i think that both sides have had their own internal motivations to fight because because they feel like they have something to gain from it but i think as time has gone on unfortunately the record proves that the palestinian side is delusional the longer that the conflict endures the worse position they'll be in but for some reason they've never had a leader that convinced them of that as much that arafat thought that if he held on there was always a better deal around the corner abbas is more concerned with trying to maintain any legitimacy amongst palestinians than actually trying to negotiate anything realistic with israel that palestinians are always incentivized to feel like as long as they keep fighting either the international community is going to save them with the five millionth un resolution condemning whatever that another icj advisory opinion is finally going to lead to the expulsion of half a million jews from the west bank or that some other international body the icj and the genocide charge is gonna come and save the palestinians as long as they in their mind feel like somebody is coming to save them then they feel like they're going to have the ability to get something better in the future but the reality is is all of the good partners for peace that the palestinians had have completely and utterly abandoned them egypt jordan the gulf states whether you're talking bilateral peace to the abraham accords most of the arab leaders in negotiating peace with israel have just not had as much of an interest in maintaining the maintaining the rights and the representations of what the palestinian people want and the only people they have today to to draw legitimacy from or to have on their side to argue with them are people that i guess write books or tweet or people in the international community that do resolutions or amnesty international reports and the reality is we can scream until we're blue in the face on these things none of it has gotten any closer to helping the palestinians in any sense of the word the condition has only gotten worse the settlements only continue to expand the military operations are only gonna get more brutal the the blockade is gonna continue to have worse effects as long as we use international law as the basis and there isn't a strong a sadat like palestinian leader that's willing to come up and confront israel with the with the brave peaceful negotiations to force them to to acquiesce nothing is gonna happen and i think that the issue you come up with is you know whether it's people like norm that talk about how brave the october seventh attacks were or how much respect they have for those fighters the the israel in a way and i think people have said as much about netanyahu the right wants violence from the palestinians because it always gives them a perpetual excuse to further the conflict well we have to go in in october seventh we've got a room of hamas well we can't trust these people in the west we have to do the night raids because you know the second intifada you know it made made us feel like the palestinian people didn't want trust with us i feel like the the the biggest thing that would force israel to change its path would be an actual a real pea not for like two weeks but an actual peaceful palestinian leader somebody committed to peace that is able to apply those standards and hold the entire region of palestine to those standards because i think over time the mounting pressure from without the the the international community and the mounting pressure from within because israel hosts a lot of its own criticism we talk about b'tselem we talk about horez like israel will host a lot of its own criticism i think that that pressure would force israel towards an actual peace agreement but it's never gonna come through violence historically it hasn't and and in the modern day violence has just hurt the palestinians more and more if you paint a picture of the future now is a good moment for both palestine and israel to get new leadership netanyahu's on the way out hamas possibly is on the way out who should rise to the top such that a peaceful settlement can be reached the now the problem is like benny said yeah it's difficult because hamas enjoys so much widespread support amongst the palestinian people i think that the well i don't know there's opinions on whether democracy or pushing them towards elections was the right or wrong idea but with like an islamic fundamentalist government for for hamas i don't know if a negotiation with israel ever happens there and then when the when the international pressure is always you know sixty seven borders infinite right of return for refugees and a total withdrawal of israel from all these lands to even start negotiations i just now see realistically that on the palestinian side no negotiations are ever going to start in a place that israel is willing to accept if you want to dismiss international law that's fine but then you have to do it consistently you can't set standards for the palestinians but reject applying those standards to israel if we're gonna have the law of the jungle then we can all be beasts and not only some of us and i think so it's either that or you have certain agreed standards that that are intended to regulate our conduct all of our conduct not just some of us well what i'm saying is i'm saying to abandon well you're saying you know international law and the millionth un resolution you're being very dismissive about all this well i'm saying and that's fine on a bank statement to be dismissive i'm saying like for instance like four four that was a chapter six resolution that's nonbinding but two four two is a second binding what is a chapter six what is what is binding do you know anything about how the un system works if you read the language of the resolution binding is typically if it commits utility a particular international law or if it establishes a power law you have free you just throw out words you hear binding does two forty two even does two forty two mention a palestinian state no of course not that's part of the problem that was the reason why the palestinians didn't wanna recognize two four two because they only referred at the very end sure but the yellow recognized one eight one and two four two when they get there they're hold on every united nations security council resolution irrespective of under which chapter it was adopted is by definition binding binding not only on the members of the security council but on every member state of the un that's read the un charter it's it's black and white sure people can look that up but the language even of two four two is kept intentionally vague such that it doesn't actually provide again the final conflict vague because the term the term land for peace originates in two four two the idea is territorial acquisition and israel's need to give it up was kept vague okay that's why in seventy that's why in seventy nine israel saw that they fulfill their obligations under two four two points of information allow me points of information yeah the first principle in un resolution two four two is that the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force which is meaningless it may be meaningless to you mister burnell to everyone who reads it miss mister burnell that principle was adopted by the friendly nations resolution the un general assembly in nineteen seventy that resolution was then reiterated in the international court of justice this ruling advisory opinion in two thousand four that was the basis of the coalition against iraq when it acquired kuwait and then declared it a province of kuwait yep which i thought supported that's what's called that's what's called under did support did did did did the shitty deal with gaza not accurate i'm not gonna go there there i'm not gonna go there it's not accurate that arafat endorsed okay i'm not gonna go there okay if all policy under international law use cogans or peremptory norms of international law the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war that is not controversial it's not vague you couldn't put it more succinctly you cannot acquire territory by force under international law on the west bank before sixty seven who owns the law district before sixty seven miss mister bunnell don't change the subject if you don't know what you're talking about change the subject at least have the view at least have the humility two you talk about traffic two four two gotten how how close has two four two gotten to the palestinian peace from tweet five you have no idea what you're talking about it's just so embarrassing at least have some humility between us who have read maybe ten thousand books on the topic and you've read two wikipedia entries and you start talking about chapter six do you know what chapter seven is answer me answer me do you know what chapter seven is answer me question how close has two four two gotten the palestinians to a state how close has the two thousand four advisory pin opinion gotten the the west bank settlement group what's your alternative the alternative is is is is not this whatever this making money off the conflict is the the actual alternative the actual alternative is should talk about yeah you're money yeah you're immediately will you go and talk to fifty million different people awesome but he has a point the the issue is you have to go through resolutions have gotten the palestinians no closer to the state they're you're earlier enforced because of the us veto they're not gonna be enforced well wait wait wait okay no worries if i may if i may you know what you know what you know what enforce the ideas you know what you know what professor morris because of your logic and i'm not disputing it that's why october seven happened oh my god because there was no options left for those people exactly what melissa said options are left after october seventh by all of that international law alrighty wait you're you're contradicting yourself on the one hand you're saying all the palestinians do is fight in violence and terrorism and all the rest of it but on the other hand you're saying they're expecting salvation from from un resolutions and international court those aren't violent they're they're part of maintaining it's the it's the continual putting off of negotiating they've solution they've negotiated as in when i think he said i'm respond when arabic's attorneys responded all over the world they're going to be different yes but it's not putting the conflict on me definitely two states in nineteen seventy five braces don't accept they do braces don't accept they do braces don't accept the two state solutions article there's you can quote arafat talking about how he's lying and he's just gonna use a ninety four and a ninety five when he's making trips on the wheelhouse he's just one of the starting grounds i i'm sorry i get so you can watch your tv and slow down to point five speed if you don't understand what i'm saying let me fit there's a very there's a very lengthy history of israeli palestinian negotiations you wanna deny that those negotiations took place where it feels like there was a a good faith effort where where there was a good faith effort where it was a good faith effort written record we have a written record we have a written record mister poppisto you can't even read the written records i don't know why you're referring to that me i just said there are fifteen thousand pages on annapolis and i'm sure you cherry quipped your favorite quote from the chairman okay that's great that's great perot at least i had a quote to check that's great all you have to do is ricky p i gave you quotes i gave you quotes get find me the information that shows the palestinian cause has been furthered by any international law you can't do it i think the problem is is is different okay you you want to say the palestinians were only fighting and then when i point out they've also gone to the court and the un say well all they do then is and you said they should be negotiating and i demonstrate that there was a lengthy record of negotiations said yeah but they didn't go in good faith again you're placing the hamster in the wheel and telling him if he runs fast enough maybe one day he'll get out of the cage what was the best negotiation on the fight over could just finish i i think the fundamental problem here is not what the palestinians have and haven't done and it's perfectly legitimate to have a discussion about whether they could have been more effective of course it could have been more effective everyone could have all always been more effective the fundamental issue here is that israel has never been prepared to concede the legitimacy of palestinian national rights in the land of the former british mandate of palestine how do you explain tabas summit how do you explain the campaign an owner to did how do you explain holberg's office in the box yeah of palestinian demands they they this is well those didn't want to give the palestinians all of palestine that's all no all of palestine all of palestine you mean all of the occupied territories no you're talking about all of palestine territories the occupied territories all of israel the occupied territories are those territories that israel occupied in june of nineteen sixty seven often use that term to define the whole of pakistan not just the west bank did you show me professor morris in all the negotiations all the negotiations and all the accounts that have been written can you show me one where the palestinians in the negotiations because that's what we were talking about wanted all of israel the maximum i can't say that because international community won't accept it so they didn't say it they didn't ask for your no no no no no no hamas did yeah hamas always said it hamas never told me hamas only negotiated with israel about prisoner exchanges yeah no i know so we're not talking about a lot of the palestinian people you will agree the only place i saw pieces of israel were the land swaps and the land swaps accounted for about two to five percent of israel nobody asked for all of israel why do you think they asked for all of israel in forty eight they asked for all of israel in sixty seven what do you think those stories were about you're not gonna respond to anything i'm saying because you have no answer respond to you that's correct okay mister bunnell we were talking about the diplomatic negotiations beginning with twenty two thousand two thousand one can't pretend that the first task for israel was in diplomacy it was through war know what you're talking about is the international law argument ever going to get the palestinians closer to state is the israeli state ever gonna be dismantled do you think that's like realistic coming up ever in the next twenty years again i'm i'm posing a question and the question is regardless of of of what's feasible or realistic today the question i'm posing is can you have peace in the middle east with this militant irrational genocidal apartheid state and power lost i don't think so no okay and the question i'm asking is can you have peace with this regime or does this regime and its institutions need to be dismantled similar to what the examples i gave of yeah of of europe and southern africa contend with the fact that most of the surrounding arab states seem to agree that you can yeah you're correct several of them most importantly egypt jordan have made their peace with israel i should add that israel's conduct since then has placed these relations under strain i i had very little i didn't take the reports of a saudi israeli rapprochement particularly seriously before october seventh the reason being that it was really a saudi israeli us deal which committed the us to make certain commitments to saudi arabia that would probably never get through congress do you not consider the egypt israeli peace deal legitimate then since the united states made a great financial contribution to egypt i i don't think the question is whether that deal is legitimate or not i think i think that deal exists but the point is whether you know the the the the core of this conflict is not between israel and egypt the core of this conflict is between israel and the palestinian people and the reason that israel agreed to relinquish the occupied egyptian sinai and the reason that egyptian israeli peace treaty was signed in nineteen seventy nine is because israel in nineteen seventy three recognized that its military superiority was ultimately nomads for egypt's determination to recover its occupied territories and that there would come a point when egypt would find a way to extract an unbearable price just the israelis wanted peace well the israelis wanted because they were afraid of what egypt might do itself talking about the average israeli citizen i i think that's a fair characterization if you're talking about the israeli leadership i think they looked at it in more strategic terms how do you remove the most powerful arab military two points simple points what was the terms of that egypt israel peace treaty international law egypt demanded every nobody's scared about international law allow me to finish every single inch of egypt nobody's gipped about international law no professor professor and sadat no professor professor professor professor i know the record they demanded as you know because you've written about it they demanded every square inch as you know they demanded the oil fields be dismantled no that's that's in the the air fields be no no dismanded they want the door open they wanted the settlements dismantled that was the settlements the oil fields and the airfield they demanded all three back you can't have what do you mean back the airfields weren't there oh where where they did ship you there that's incorrect what's what's you're incorrect they filled an airfield the israelis built an airfield in the occupied sinai yes and they wanted it back they didn't want it it back wasn't this no okay they wanted the territory in which they were built okay the oil fields the air fields the settlements have to be dismantled yes reagan said i don't wanna be the first prime minister to dismantle they did a settlement but he did why because of the law no no it was because of peace it was normalization with the law law had nothing to do with anything alright peace it was the politician with the law law had nothing to do with anything alright it was in a negotiation two states each certain not the law had nothing to do with anything repeatedly in the negotiations you're not listening i know you're missing one point spread the negotiations the law has nothing to do with any foreign relations of us volumes on it nobody cares about the law the palestinians kept saying we want exactly since they weren't there allow me to finish the palestinians kept saying we want what egypt got we want what egypt got yeah egypt got everything back to do with the law okay nothing to do with it and number two i'm not saying it's the whole picture but as foreign minister moisha diane said at the time he said if a car has four wheels and you remove one wheel the car can't move and for them removing egypt from the arab front would then remove any arab military threat to israel so mu'in mu'in was no the first part did and that's what the palestinians kept saying don't want the first part is that egypt got from yeah yeah yeah that's true but forget international law and by the way have nothing to do with one last thing one last on a personal note the quote about sharm el sheikh without peace it's yeah yeah okay that's the only thing you ever cited from a book of mine you correct cited from your book yes i was absolutely shocked at your betrayal of your people that was pure treason it was one apologize for that i apologize okay i apologize i think so alright well let me try once again for the region and for just entirety of humanity what gives you hope we just heard a lot of pessimistic cynical takes what gives you hope like war that's that's a good reason that's hope in other words the fear of war the disaster of war should give people an impetus to try and seek peace when you look at people in gaza and people in the west bank people in israel they should want fundamentally no but fundamentally they hate war yes i think so what what gives you hope there is no hope no it's an extreme no i'm hey i'm not happy to say that of course you are it's a it's a very bleak moment right now because that i agree with i agree with israel believes it has to restore what it calls its deterrence capability i think you've written about it actually i just realized israel has to restore its deterrence cap capability and after the catastrophe of october seventh restoring its deterrence capacity means this part you didn't write about the annihilation of gaza and then moving on to the hezbollah no no that's right so so the israelis are dead set on restoring that deterrence capability on the arab side and i know muin and i have disagreed on it and we're allowed to disagree i think the arab side the lesson they learned from october seventh is israelis aren't as strong as we thought they were and that will be an unfortunate unfortunate message because that's really what the outcome is clear and they think that there is a military option though and i think that that's a it's a zero sum game at this point and it's very very bleak and i'm not going to lie about that now i will admit my predictive capacities are not perfect are limited but for the moment it's a very bleak situation that i agree and i don't see right now a way out however at the very minimum permanent ceasefire and the inhuman and illegal blockade of gaza and we're really not they were shooting rockets at israel for for twenty years why is that illegal to blockade gaza he thinks the bottle rockets why why why is it illegal i'll tell you why you don't rock it to your neighbor you rock it to neighbor expect consequences tell you why expect consequences but that works both ways i know i know i know i know professor marr both ways i'll tell you why because every human rights humanitarian and un organization in the world irrelevant has said has said that the fund hey nobody cares about amnesty is a form of collective punishment nobody cares about amnesty illegal under international law illegal the word of the you think you think a blockade you don't understand the way the world works yeah and these things are irrelevant and you think confining because that's the blockade yes you don't confining confining a million children combining that's the choice combining that's hamas choice a million children in what the economist called okay a human rubbish sheep the economist supported israel in this war and continue to support israel but international committee of red cross called a sinking ship what the un high commissioner for human rights called a toxic slum you think it is a slum of course you you think that is caused by the law international law you think it's legitimate forget the law hey i know you wanna forget the law what about the law thing that every is what about every israeli fears the most what the law as as no no sippy recently said i studied international law i oppose international law of course you don't wanna hear about the law then it's got nothing to do with anything okay so here's the thing yeah then don't complain about october seventh if you don't want do you hear me complain if you wanna say forget about the law all i said was acting like burglary there is no international humanitarian law there's no distinction between civilians and combatants there should be and so so there should be this conflict now you're doing what moeen said you're becoming very selective about the law if you wanna forget about the law hamas had every right to do what he did it had every right to do what he did according to you not to me because you want to forget the law do you still support the houthis shooting random shit absolutely k that's a violation of international law so you play the same games absolutely and were there a power during world war two who had the courage of the houthis where there are power to have that kind of courage courageous to be bombing merchant ships while while tens of thousand people die of actual starvation not the starvation that exists in the gaza strip where people before october said don't die of starvation not that not the concentration deposition that got started on the movies what about starvation in yemen don't they have something better to do the houthis yes i know don't they have the houthis don't they have anything to do three years they lost a hundred eighty thousand people shouldn't they be feeding the yemeni sixty thousand yemenis die why fight starvation why fight the western powers in israel when you should be taking care of your problems at home the houthis often the only allies of the dispossessed are those who experience similar circumstances don't you think that they should take take care of the yemen yemeni problems as i said happy i'm very happy they're helping out the palestinians anyone who helps the expensive enemies anybody they pay for it anybody who comes to the aid of those suffering a genocide half of whom are genocide half of whom are children yeah according to the most current un reports as of today one quarter of the population of gaza is starving that means five hundred thousand children are starving are on the verge of famine they keep saying on the verge of on the verge of famine i have not i have not seen it was unlivable i have not seen one palestinian die of starvation in these last four months not one there have been documented cases they're on the verge there have been documented cases i haven't seen them yesterday al jazeera said six and the day before that they said two so those are their okay the two the star that number probably died in israel starvation also yes i i don't think there's famine in israel there isn't there isn't in the gaza strip either like that it's something which is produced for the western western there are infants dying due to a engineered lack of access to food and its presence engineered i think the hamas stopped shooting perhaps or unfortunately unfortunately as you said engineered i think amnesty and excuse me human rights watch called it using starvation as a weapon that's called engineering okay that's what they did but you were pushed on this by coleman hughes to bring up like an example of why is the gaza strip like what by what metric are they starving by what metric is it so behind the rest of the world you know if we're gonna bring up why wouldn't he answer that because he didn't answer it for me answer it yeah i just called you from the humanitarian organizations they said one quarter of the population of gaza is now verging on famine before october seventh before october seventh going before october seventh that as justification for hamas fighting you say the conditions were unlivable they had to fight i said to him so my question is what made it unlivable prior to october seventh what are the what are the metrics that you're using there were about five six or seven reports issued by unctad issued by the world bank issued by the international monetary fund and they all said that's why that's why why did they say why why did they say that that's why the economist not a radical periodical describe gaza as a human rubbish so tell me by what metrics if you're if you're a historian if you do all this work tell me by one of the script he's not gonna answer again i i don't think i've avoid any of your questions except except when they breached when they breached the threshold of complete imbecility tell me that what metric to gaza strip this in humanity crisis remember what i said a moment ago i said to professor morris i defer to expertise i look at what the organization say i look at what the united nations high commissioner of human rights said that you don't know you don't know or you don't care okay that's fine that's fine you know how complicated have you ever investigated how complicated is the metric for hunger starvation and famine it is such a complicated metric they figured out if you asked me to repeat it now i couldn't do it and yet we have a human development index where we rank countries yet we can still measure infant mortality life expectancy the yeah we can measure all of these things yeah moeen i'm holding out for you here you still didn't answer the hope question what gives you a source of hope about the region well first of all i would agree with benny morris and and norman finkelstein that the current situation is bleak and i think it would be unreasonable to expect it to not get even bleaker in the coming weeks and months and we now this conflict really it originated in the late nineteenth century it's been been a more or less active conflict since the nineteen twenties nineteen thirties and it has produced a tremendous amount of of of suffering and and and regional conflict and geopolitical complications and all of that but what gives me hope is that throughout their entire ordeal the palestinian people have never surrendered and i believe they never will surrender to overwhelming force and violence they have taken everything that israel has thrown at them they have taken everything that the west has thrown at them they have taken everything that those who are supposed to be their natural allies have on occasion thrown at them but this is a people that never has and i believe never will surrender and at a certain point i think israel and its leaders will have to come to the realization that by hook or by crook these people are going to achieve their inalienable and legitimate national rights and and that that is going to be a reality i i as i was what do you mean by that you mean all of palestine is that what you mean no and and from the river to the sea well ideally of course yes and and what i was inalienable rights no what i was saying earlier and then the discussion got sidetracked is that i did believe that a two state settlement a partition of palestine along the nineteen sixty seven boundaries would have been a reasonable solution because i think it also would have opened pathways to further but now you believe what further nonviolent engagement between israel and the palestinians that could create other forms of coexistence in a federal or binational or what do you think about refugees in regards to that do you think there has to be a resettlement of the five or six million whoever wants to lay claim to be the center of the i think i think there has to be an explicit acknowledgment of responsibility of of the responsibility and and the return and of their rights i think that in the framework of a two state settlement i think a formula would need to be found that does not undermine the foundations of a two state settlement and i don't think it would be that difficult because i suspect that there are probably large numbers of palestinian refugees who once their rights are acknowledged will find it exceptionally distasteful canada exceptionally distasteful to have to live among the kind of sentiments that we've heard around this table today to be quite frank i mean i heard i you know i'm i was previously unfamiliar with you and i watched one of your preparation videos very disconcerting stuff i have to say you were explaining two days ago in the discussion about apartheid and how absurd it was that in your view jim crow was not apartheid jim crow was not apartheid but arab states not giving citizenship to palestinian refugees is apartheid my issue that's what i meant with my with your comments about white supremacy so my issue that's great the white supremacy comment and if i so my well hold on let me let me respond okay my issue is that i feel like we have jumped on this euphemistic treadmill and i think that's part of the reason why this conflict will never get solved it's because on one end you've got a people who are now convinced internationally that they're victims of apartheid genocide concentration camp conditions ethnic cleansing they're forced to live in an open air prison with all of these things that are stacked against them all of these terms that are highly specific that revert to to very precise things and then when people like you said that they should less from someone who doesn't think jim crow is a part i don't know if jim who does because of fear of states the problem is you're morally loading for you apartheid is when racists do bad things no no there's there's a definition of apartheid that's great there's a very clear definition top down racial domination enacted through top down like federal federal legislative policies or whatever means that i don't know if i don't know if jim crow would have qualified for part of that that doesn't make it any less excuse me i'm talking right now excuse me excuse me i'm talking to your friend over here i don't know if it would have qualified as the crime of apartheid just like if israel were to literally nuke the gaza strip and kill two million people i don't know if that would qualify for the crime of genocide probably not i don't well yeah but because genocide requires a special intent i think the issue is and and instead of and i think this conversation is actually is emblematic of the entire conversation i don't think any let me finish answering jim morris's question supporting racism so yeah look i think did the the and you are i did do you think i support jim crow laws look when the fact that you can't even answer that honestly it doesn't matter what say that eight hundred civilians were killed by by hamas you said well maybe four hundred were killed by israel no i didn't say that said four hundred no i didn't say that you cosigned the opinion no i didn't no i didn't oh well wait how many what do you i think the word was some that's what i heard no i well you weren't listening how many people do you think approximately if you had to vault if you had to ballpark it how how many do you think were killed by hamas on october seventh i think it's pretty clear that the majority of civilians that were killed fifty one percent or ninety percent don't ask me to put a number on some of those things i'm doing very different intuition of all are you when you say hamas do you mean palestinians or do you mean hamas specific palestinian force i don't like to say palestinians because i don't think all palestinian civilians were about no facts i'll say hamas islamic jihad whatever your outcuts but that's how this discussion started you said hamas and i began to answer that and then benny morris said actually he means hamas in addition to jihad and the others so so of the invading palestinian force how many do you think killed civilians versus the idf what do you think of the ballpark the percentage well the figures we have are that about a third of the casualties on october seventh were military that's not what i have to do were what's your question how many what percentage of civilians coming were killed by the invading force i i think i think a clear majority but i can't give you a specific figure if you thought it was closer to fifty one percent or ninety nine percent were killed by why would you know that how is that it's because it's interesting to actually stake out of position yeah it's interesting if you wanna be completely totally agnostic on a test time complete ignorance because we don't know professor morris doesn't know muinne rabani doesn't know speak with absolute certainty that the idf is targeting and murdering palestinian children intentional oh absolutely double standard no i don't you see i know you don't i know i know it was a rhetorical question obviously you don't because because we're gonna get on the matter at the un report uh-huh i looked at the un don't report no the un report on the great march of return in twenty eighteen and they said that the snipers were targeting children medics journalists and disabled people just as they are now in this country exactly no more journalists have been killed in the last several months in gaza than in any other country acknowledge do you acknowledge that all of us that's hamas is not killing journalists in gaza you agree that they operate in civilian uniforms that their goal is to induce that confusion that that's the the the way that they conduct themselves militarily let me finish my point more journalists i understand have been more you children than the he doesn't wanna hear it it's so boring because it's virtue you're not having a a material consensual it is virtue signaling yeah yes like when you say children you have to talk about how many families were killed that's not virtue signaling because that's human life i don't care about her i don't care if a hundred killed her a thousand percent plan to fifty one percent the question yes that's not the number that's the responsibility norm and then moeen moeen mentions that more journalists were killed in gaza than in all of world war two that doesn't get that doesn't prove there any part of the more medics were killed no no that's so that's silly and and then he says it's virtual scenario but when israelis get killed that's serious i never said it's serious on both sides of me i'm not i'm asking a substantive question of who do you assign blame to or do you plan to norm finkelstein's conspiracies that the ambulances should have known immediately who was dead that the numbers were changed because they were fake for that maybe fifty one percent of the people were killed by by hamas and and islamic jihad but forty nine percent were killed by ibs helicopters you asked me direct question and you got a direct answer i did it i got majority which could be an absolute fifty one to ninety nine clear majority what percent is a clear majority as opposed to they live in ambiguity majority in my view is well over fifty percent please don't ask me to be more precise because i you could say eighty ninety ninety five percent if i knew that i would say it i think it's a reasonable it's a reasonable perhaps it is but i'd you're not the best person to be asking that question you know i read when you wrote up describe operation defensive shield and you said a few dozen homes were destroyed you're talking about what happened in the refugee camp and you said no the arabs said five hundred you guys said five hundred you said five hundred you said five hundred palestinians were killed in germany never said that and then the no but that that was the statement of the plo palestinian authority you said a few dozen and there were massacres there there were a few dozen yes a few dozen yeah well it turned out a a hundred forty building buildings were destroyed that's right five thousand people five thousand people were left homeless how many people killed you just five thousand how many people killed no i'm talking about homes destroyed so you're not the best person to be criticizing what moeen says when he says clear majority but he can't say more you know why he can't say more he doesn't know he doesn't know yeah yeah i understand that i hope as a question to belittle i would give you a very different answer i would just say i don't know i do know so much on if you want the right phrase there would be the overwhelming majority were killed by arab gunmen and very small number were killed by israelis by accident or whatever you're not speaking to this probably true that that may be the i i can i can state with confidence a clear majority overwhelming majority you may be correct but i can't state that with certainty i think there's a very easy way to find out is to have a independent forget independent i know exactly well of course you forget independence forget that doesn't mean anything forget the law independent is you and high commissioner forget independent independent un high commission independent un high commission not necessary just repeat the law just repeat the law just repeat the law you know a syrian was the head of the un commission for human rights but if it wasn't israeli it would have been okay he certainly would have been more honest than a syrian oh yeah for from your perspective but to disagree with steven i thought this was extremely valuable and at times really like the the the view of history the the passion i'm really grateful that you would spend your really valuable time and just one more question since we have two historians here but just briefly from a history perspective what do you hope your legacy as historians benny and norm will be of the work that you've put out there maybe norm you can go first and try to just say briefly i think there's a a value to preserving the record i'm not optimistic about where things are going to end up it was a very nice book written by a woman named helen hunt jackson at the end of the nineteenth century describing what was done to the native americans she called it a century of dishonor and she described in vivid poignant detail what was done to the native americans did it save them no did it help them probably not did it preserve their memory yes and i think there's a value to that you know there was a famous film by eisenstein sergei eisenstein it was either battleship potemkin or mother i can't remember which one the last scene was the tsar's troops mowing down all the russian people he pans the scene not all the russian people yeah but he pans the massacre he pans the massacre but he coulda killed a lot more and the last words of the movie were proletarians exclamation point remember exclamation point and i've seen it as my life's work to preserve the memory and to remember i didn't expect that anyone would read my book on gaza it's very dense it gives me even a bit of a headache to read at least one of the chapters you wrote a book on gaza and but i thought that the memory deserves to be preserved amen well i would just say very briefly unlike my colleague i think writing the truth about what happened in history in various periods of history if i've done a little bit of that i'm happy thank you norm thank you benny thank you steven thank you muin thanks for listening to
