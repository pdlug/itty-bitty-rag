the following is a conversation with walter isaacson one of the greatest biography writers ever having written incredible books on albert einstein steve jobs leonardo da vinci jennifer doudna benjamin franklin henry kissinger and now a new one on elon musk we talked for hours on and off the mic i'm sure we'll talk many more times walter is a truly special writer thinker observer and human being i highly recommend people read his new book on elon i'm sure there will be short term controversy but in the long term i think it will inspire millions of young people especially with difficult childhoods with hardship in their surroundings or in their own minds to take on the hardest problems in the world and to build solutions to those problems no matter how impossible the odds in this conversation walter and i cover all of his books and use personal stories from them to speak to the bigger principles of striving for greatness in science in tech engineering art politics and life there are many things in the new elon book that i felt are best saved for when i speak to elon directly again on this podcast which will be soon enough perhaps it's also good to mention here that my friendships like with elon nor any other influence like money access fame power will ever result in me sacrificing my integrity ever i do like to celebrate the good in people to empathize and to understand but i also like to call people out on their bullshit with respect and with compassion if i fail i fail due to a lack of skill not a lack of integrity i'll work hard to improve and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this podcast we got master class for learning netsuite for business stuff betterhelp for mental health expressvpn for security and privacy and shopify for well buying and selling whatever on the internet choose wisely my friends also if you want to work with our team our amazing team we're always hiring go to lex friedman dot com slash hiring and now onto the full ad reads as always no silly ads in the middle i try to make these interesting but if you must skip them friends please still check out our sponsors i enjoy their stuff maybe you will too this show is brought to you by a master class you can pay just a little bit of money and learn from the best people in the world at doing whatever it is they do there's many ways to learn a thing one is by doing another is by reading watching other people give tutorials on how to do the thing and the other is to observe the people that do the thing at a world class level or who are the best in the world at doing that thing i think oh well it's not the only thing you should be doing that is as good as it gets that's the advice i've always been given and i've given one of the best ways to excel in life and not in some shallow way but in a deep way is to find the people in this world who you want to become and do anything you can to work with them to be around them to learn from them and that's because they sit down and give their time to to teach but by just being in their presence and observing how they work and then giving everything you can to contribute to that effort to that mission to sort of the passion that pulls them and that drives them in some sense watching a masterclass is a way of doing that i i'm a big fan of watching not just teachers but the doers in this world i can go on the list is incredible from chris hadfield to will wright man i should really talk to will wright carlos santana and i should talk to carlos santana and not just talk talking is not enough friends play guitar anyway get unlimited access to every master class and get fifteen percent off an annual membership at class dot com slash

meetings some of them are horribly drowning bureaucracy some of them resist and fight that bureaucracy and actually get something done and that's that little struggle of humanity in these little pockets of dreams and sweat and labor and just reaching for the stars with big goals and small goals that's what this podcast is about with with elon with steve jobs and all throughout history with

with walter we talk quite a bit about demons both demons and diablo i think we'll allude to that and demons inside our own mind and those demons are not all bad they're in some sense reminders of how difficult life can be how much struggle big and small all of us can experience and that struggle can break us or it can strengthen us that's the choice all of us make through hardship and some of the greatest men and women in the world in the history of the world have been defined in their early days by the struggle and the overcoming of that struggle talking in general but therapy which is systematic rigorous exploration of the human mind through the talking method i i think should be one of the tools for that for turning the demons into productive demons versus destructive demons

podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's walter isaacson what is the role of a difficult childhood in the lives of great men and women great minds is that a requirement is it a catalyst or is it just a simple coincidence of fate well it's not a requirement some people with happy childhood do do quite well but it certainly is true that a lot of really driven people are driven because they're harnessing the demons of their childhood even barack obama's sentence in his memoirs which is i think every successful man is either trying to live up to the expectations of of his father or live down the sins of his father and for elon it's especially true because he had both a violent and difficult childhood and a very psychologically problematic father he's got those demons dancing around in his head and by harnessing them it's part of the reason that he does riskier more adventurous wilder things than maybe i would ever do you've written that elon talked about his father and that at times it felt like mental torture the the interaction with him during his childhood can you describe some of the things you've learned yeah well elon and kimball would tell me that for example when elon got bullied on the playground and one day was pushed down some concrete steps and had his face pummeled so badly that kimball said i couldn't really recognize him i mean he was in the hospital for almost a week but when he came home elon had to stand in front of his father and his father berated him for more than an hour and said he was stupid and took the side of the of the person who had beaten him that's probably one of the more traumatic events of elon's life yes and there's also veld school which is a sort of paramilitary camp that young south african boys got sent to and at one point you know he was scrawny he has very bad at picking up social cues and emotional cues he talks about being asperger's and so he gets traumatized at a camp like that but the second time he went he'd gotten bigger he had shot up to almost six feet and he learned a little bit of judo and he realized that if he was getting beaten up he might it might hurt him but it he would just punch the person in the nose as hard as possible so that sense of always punching back is also been ingrained in elon i spent a lot of time talking to errol musk his father elon don't talk to errol musk anymore his father nor does kimbal it's been years and errol doesn't even have elon's email so a lot of times errol will be sending me emails and errol had one of those jekyll and hyde personalities he was you know a great mind of engineering and especially material science knew how to build a wilderness camp in south africa using mica and how it would not conduct the heat but he also would go into these dark periods in which he would just be psychologically abusive and of course maymusk says to me the his mother who divorced daryl early on said the danger for elon is that he becomes his father and every now and then you've been with him so much lex and you know him well he'll even talk to you about the demons about diablo dancing in his head i mean he he gets it he's self aware but you've probably seen him at times where those demons take over and he goes really dark and really quiet and grimes says you know i can tell a minute or two in advance when demon mode's about to happen and he'll go a bit dark i was you know here at austin wants a dinner with a group and you could tell suddenly something had triggered him and he was gonna go dark i've watched it in meetings where somebody will say we can't make that part for less than two hundred dollars or no that's wrong and he'll berate them and then he snaps out of it as as you know that too the the huge snap out where mhmm suddenly he's showing you monty python skit on his phone and he's joking about things so i think coming out of the childhood there were just many facets maybe even many personalities the engineering mode the silly mode the charismatic mode the visionary mode but also the demon in dark mode a quote you cited about elon really stood out to me i forget who it's from but inside the man he's still there as a child the child standing in front of his dad that was tallulah his second wife and she's great she's an english actress they've been married twice actually and talula said that's just him from his childhood he's a drama addict kimball says that as well and i asked why and he said and tallulah said you know for him love and family are kind of associated with those psychological torments and in many ways he'll channel i mean tallulah would be with him in two thousand and eight when the company was going back or whatever it may have been or later and he would be so stressed he would vomit and then he would channel things that his father had said use phrases his father had said to him and so she told me deep inside the man is this man child still standing in front of his father to what degree is that true for many of us do you think i think it's true but in many different ways i'll say something personal which is i was blessed and perhaps it's a bit of a downside too with the fact that i had the greatest father you could ever imagine and mother they were the kindest people you'd ever wanna meet i grew up in a magical place in new orleans my dad was an engineer an electrical engineer and you know he was always kind perhaps i'm not quite as driven or as crazed i don't have to prove things so i get to write about elon musk i get to write about you know einstein or steve jobs or leonardo da vinci who as you know was totally torn by demons and had different difficult childhood situations not even legitimized by his father so sometimes those of us who are lucky enough to have really gentle sweet childhood we grow up with fewer demons but we grow up with fewer drives and we end up maybe being boswell and not being doctor johnson we end up being the observer not being the doer and so i always respect those who are in the arena i don't you know you don't see yourself as a man in the arena i've had a gentle sweet career and i've got to cover really interesting people but i've never shot off a rocket that might someday get to mars i've never moved us into the era of electric vehicles i've never stayed up all night on the factory floor i don't have quite those either the drives or the addiction to risk i mean elon's addicted to risk he's addicted to adventure me if i see something that's risky i spend some time calculating okay upside downside here but that's another reason that people like elon musk get stuff done and people like me write about the elon musks one other aspect of this given a difficult childhood whether it's elon or da vinci i wonder if there's some wisdom some advice almost that you can draw that you can give to people with difficult childhoods i think all of us have demons even those of us who grew up in a magical part of new orleans with sweet parents yes and we all have demons and rule one in life is harness your demons know that you're ambitious or not ambitious or you're lazy or whatever leonardo da vinci knew he was a procrastinator you know i think it's usual to know what's eaten at you know how to harness it also know what you're good at i'll take musk as another example i'm a little bit more like kimbal musk than elon i maybe got over endowed with the empathy gene and what does that mean well it means that i was okay when i ran time magazine there was a group about a hundred and fifty people on the editorial floors and i knew them all and we had a jolly time when i went to cnn i was not very good at being a manager or an executive of an organization i cared a little bit too much that people didn't get annoyed at me or mad at me and elon said that about john mcneil for example who was president of tesla it's in the book i talked to john mcneil a long time and he says you know elon just would fire people be really rough on people he didn't have the empathy for the people in front of him and elon says yeah that's right and john mcneil couldn't fire people he cared more about pleasing the people in front of him than pleasing the entire enterprise or getting things done being over endowed with a desire to please people can make you less tough of a manager and that doesn't mean there aren't great people who are over endowed ben franklin over endowed with the desire to please people the worst criticism of him from john adams and others was that he was insinuating which kind of meant he was always trying to get people to like him but that turned out to be a good thing when they can't figure out the big state little state issue at the constitutional convention when they can't figure out the treaty of powers whatever it is he brings people together and that is his superpower so to get back to the lessons you asked and you know the first was harness your demons the second is to know your strengths and your super power mhmm my super power is definitely not being a tough manager after running cnn for a while i said okay i got proven i don't really enjoy this or know how to do this well you know do i have other talents yeah i think i have the talent to observe people really closely to write about it in a straight but i hope interesting narrative style that's a power it's totally different from running an organization it took me until three years of running cnn that i realized i'm not cut to be an executive in a really high intense situations elon musk is cut to be an executive in highly intense situation so much so that when things get less intense when they actually are making enough cars and rockets are going up and landing he thinks of something else so he can surge and have more intensity he's addicted to intensity and that's his superpower which is a lot greater than the superpower of being a good observer but i think also to build on that it's not just addiction to like risk and drama there's always a big mission above it so i would say it's an empathy towards people in the big picture it's an empathy towards humanity humanity more than the empathy towards the three or four humans who might be sitting in the conference room with you and that's a big deal you see that in a lot of people you see it bill gates or larry summers elon musk they always have empathy for these great goals of humanity and at times they can be clueless about the emotions of the people in front of them or callous sometimes musk as you said is driven by mission more than any person i've ever seen and it's not only mission it's like cosmic missions meaning he's got three really big missions one is to make humans a space faring civilization make us multiplanetary or get us to mars number two is to bring us into the era of sustainable energy to bring us into the era of electric vehicles and solar roofs and battery packs and third is to make sure that artificial intelligence is safe and is aligned with human values and every now and then i'd talk to him and we'd be talking about starlink satellites or whatever or he would be pushing the people in front of him at spacex and saying if you do this we'll never get to mars in our lifetime and then he would give the lecture how important it was for human consciousness to get to mars in our lifetime and i'm thinking okay this is the pep talk of somebody trying to inspire a team or maybe it's a type of of pontification you do on a podcast but on like the twentieth time i watched him i realized okay i believe it he actually is driven by this he is frustrated and angry that because of this particular minor engineering decision the big mission is not going to be accomplished it's not a pep talk it's a literal frustration and impatience of frustration and it's also just probably the most deeply ingrained thing in him is his mission he joked at one point to me about how much he loved reading comics as a kid and he said all the people in the comic books they're trying to save the world but they're wearing their underpants on the outside and they look ridiculous and then he paused and said but they are trying to save the world and whether it's starlink in ukraine or starship going to mars or trying to get a global new tesla i think he's got this epic sense of the role he's gonna play in helping humanity on big things and like the the characters in the comic books it's sometimes ridiculous but it also is sometimes true when i was reading this part of the book i was thinking of all the young people who are struggling in this way and i think a lot of people are in different ways whether they grow up without a father whether they grow up with physical emotional mental abuse or demons of any kind as you talked about and it's really painful to read but also really damn inspiring that if you sort of walk side by side with those demons if you don't let that pain break you or somehow channel it if you can put it this way that you can achieve you can do great things in this world well that's an epic view of why we write biography which is more epic than i had even thought of so i say thank you because in some ways what you're trying to do is say okay i mean leonardo you talk about being a misfit he's born illegitimate in the village of vinci and he's gay and he's left handed and he's distracted and his father won't legitimize him and then he wanders off to the town of florence and he becomes the greatest artist and engineer of the early renaissance of that part of the renaissance i hope this book inspires jennifer doudna the gene editing pioneer who discovers helps discover crispr gene editing tool which my book the code breaker she grew up feeling like a misfit you know in hawaii in a polynesian vill village being the only white person and also trying to live up to a father who pushed her so if people can read the books and i i should've said about jennifer doudna my point was that she was told by her school guidance counselor no girls don't do science you know science is not for girls you're not gonna do math or science and so it pushes her to say alright i'm gonna do math and science just just to interrupt real quick but jennifer downer you've written an amazing book about her nobel prize winner yeah crispr developer she's incredible one of the great scientists in the twenty first century right and i'm talking about when jennifer doudna was young and she felt really really out of place like you and me and a lot of people when they feel in that way they read books they go into they curl off with the book so her father drops a book on her bed called the double helix the book by james watson on the discovery of the structure of dna by him and rosalind franklin and francis crick and she realizes oh my god girls can become scientists my school guidance counselor is wrong so i think books like she read this book and even if it's a comic books like elon musk read books can sometimes inspire you and every one of my books is about people who were totally innovative who weren't just smart because none of us are gonna be able to match einstein and mental processing power but we can be as curious as he was and creative and think out of the box the way he did or steve jobs put it think different and so i hope with my books i'm saying this isn't a how to guide but this is somebody you can walk alongside mhmm you can see einstein growing up jewish in germany you can see jennifer doudna growing up or as an outsider or leonardo da vinci or elon musk you know in really violent south africa with a psychologically difficult father and getting off the train when he goes to anti apartheid concert with his brother and there's a man with a knife sticking out of his head and they step into the pool of blood and it's sticky on their souls this causes you know scars that last the rest of your life and the question is not how do you avoid getting scarred it's you know how do you deal with it einstein too one of my and it's hard to pick my favorite of your biographies but i einstein i mean you really paint a picture of another i don't wanna call him a misfit but a person who doesn't necessarily have a a standard trajectory through life of of success so absolutely and it's that's extremely inspiring i don't know exactly what question to ask there's a million well i'll talk about the misfit for a second because you know we talked about leonardo being that way you know einstein's jewish in germany at a time when it starts getting difficult he's slow in learning how to talk and he's a visual thinker so he's always daydreaming and imagining things the first time he applies to the zurich polytech because he runs away from the german education system because it's too much learning by rote he gets rejected by the zurich polytech that's the second best school in zurich and they're rejecting einstein i tried to find but couldn't the name of the admissions counselor at the zurich college yeah like you rejected einstein and then he doesn't finish in the top half of his class and once he does and he goes to graduate school they don't accept his dissertation so he can't get a job he's not teaching it he even tries about fourteen different high schools gymnasium to get a job and they won't take him so he's a third class examiner in the swiss patent office first class because he doesn't have a doctoral degree and yet he's sitting there on the first class because he doesn't have a doctoral degree and yet he's sitting there on the stool in the patent office in nineteen o five and writes three papers that totally transform science and if you're thinking about being misunderstood or unappreciated in nineteen oh six he's still a third class patrick in nineteen oh seven he still is it takes until nineteen oh nine before people realize that this notion of the theory of relativity might be correct and it might upend all of newtonian physics how is it possible for three of the greatest papers in the history of science to be written in one year by this one person is there some insights wisdoms you draw plus he had a day job as a patent examiner right and there's really three papers but there's also an addendum because once you figure out quantum theory and then you figure out relativity and you're understanding maxwell's equations and the speed of light he does a little addendum that's the most famous equation in all of physics which is e equals mc squared so it's a pretty good year it partly starts because he's a visual thinker and i think it was helpful not and so the patent office said doing devices to synchronize clocks because the swiss have just gone on standard time zones and swiss people as you know tend to be rather you know swiss they care if it strikes the hour in basel it should do the same and burn at the exact instant so you have to send a light signal between two distant clocks and he's visualizing what's it look like to ride alongside a light beam he says well if you catch up with it if if you go almost as fast it'll look stationary but maxwell's equations don't allow for that and he said it was making my palms sweat that i was so worried and so he finally figures out because he's looking at these devices to synchronize clocks that if you're traveling really really fast what's looks synchronous to you or synchronized to you is different than for somebody traveling really fast in the other direction and he makes a mental leap that time that the speed of light's always constant but time is relative depending on your state of motion so it was that type of out of the box thinking those leaps that made nineteen o five his miracle year likewise with musk i mean after general motors and ford everybody gives up on electric vehicles to just say i know how we're going to have a path to change the entire trajectory of the world into the era of electric vehicles and then when he comes back from russia where he tried to buy a little rocket ship so he could send a experimental greenhouse to mars and they were poking fun of him and actually spit on him at one point in a drunken lunch this is very fortuitous because on the ride back home on the plane on the you know delta airlines flight he's like doing the calculations of how much materials how much metal how much fuel how much would it really cost and so he's visualizing things that other people would would just say is impossible it's what steve jobs' friends called the reality distortion field and it drove people crazy it drove them mad but it also drove them to do things they didn't think they would be able to do you said visual thinking i wonder if you've seen parallels of the different styles and kinds of thinking that that operate the minds of these people so is there parallels you see between elon steve jobs einstein da vinci specifically in how they think i think they were all visual thinkers perhaps it was coming from slight handicaps as children meaning you know leonardo was left handed and a little bit dyslexic i think and certainly einstein had a choreo he would repeat things he was slow in learning to talk so i think visualizing helps a lot and with musk i see it all the time when i'm walking the factory lines with him or in product development where he'll look at say the heat shield under the raptor engine of a starship booster and he'll say why does it have to be this way couldn't we trim it this way or make it or even get rid of this part of it and he can visualize the material sciences and small anecdotes in my book but at one point he's on the tesla line and they're trying to get five thousand cars a week in twenty eighteen mhmm it's a life or death situation and he's looking at the machines that are bolting something to the chassis and he insists that drew bagley not drew let lars moravey one of his great lieutenants come and they have to summon him and he says why are there six bolts here and lars and others explained well for the crash test or anything else the pressure would be in this way so you have to and they were blah blah blah blah blah and he said no if you visualize it you'll see if there's a crash it would the force would go this way and that way and it could be done with four bolts now that sounds risky and they go test it and they engineer it but turns out to be right i know that seems minor but i could give you five hundred of those where in any given day he's visualizing the physics of an engineering or manufacturing problem that sounds pretty mundane but for me if you say what makes him special there's a mission driven thing i give you a lot of reasons but one of the reasons is he cares not just about the design of the product but visualizing the manufacturing and of the product the machine that makes the machine and that's what we failed to do in america for the past forty years we outsource so much manufacturing i don't think you can be a good innovator if you don't know how to make the stuff you're designing and that's why musk puts his designer's desk right next to the assembly lines in the factories so that they have to visualize what they drew as it becomes the physical object so understanding everything from the physics all the way up to the to the software it's like end to end well having an end to end control is important certainly with steve jobs i'm looking at my iphone here it's a big deal that hardware only works with apple software and only works you know so he has an end to end that makes it like a zen garden in kyoto very carefully curated but a thing of beauty for musk when he first was at tesla and before he was the ceo when he was just the executive chairman and basically the finance person person funding it they were outsourcing everything they were making the batteries in japan and the battery pack would be at some barbecue shop in thailand and then sent to the lotus factory in england to be put into a lotus elise chassis and then that was a nightmare you did not have end to end control of the manufacturing process so he goes to the other extreme he gets a a factory in fremont from toyota and he wants to do everything in house the software in house the painting in house you know the the the battery he makes his own batteries and i think that end to end control is part of his personality i mean there's a but it also would allows tesla to be innovative yeah i got to see and understand in detail one example of that which is the development of the brain of the car in autopilot going from mobile eye to in house building the autopilot system to mhmm basically getting rid of all sensors that are not rich in data to make it ai friendly sort of saying that we can do it all with vision and like you said removing some of the bolts so sometimes it's small things but sometimes it's really big things like getting rid of radar well vision only getting rid of radar is huge and everybody's against it everybody and they're still fighting at a bit they're still trying to do a next generation some form of radar but it gets back to the first principles we're talking about visualizing well he starts with the first principles and the first principles of physics involve things like well humans drive with only visual input they don't have radar they don't have lidar they don't have sonar and so there is no reason in the laws of physics that make it so that vision only won't be successful in creating self driving now that becomes an article of faith to him and he gets a lot of pushback but now and he's by the way not been that successful in meeting his deadlines of getting self driving he's way too optimistic but it was that first principles of get rid of unnecessary things now you would think lidar why not use it like why not use a crust it's like yeah we can do things vision only but when i look at the stars at night i use a telescope too well you could use lidar but you can't do millions of cars that way at scale at a certain point you have to make it not only a good product but a product that goes to scale and you can't make it based on maps like google maps because it'll never be able to you know then drive from new orleans to slidell where i wanna go when it's too hot in new orleans take for example full self drive he has been obsessed with what he calls the robo taxi we're gonna build the next generation car without a steering wheel mhmm without pedals because it's gonna be full self drive you just summon it you won't need to drive it well over and over again all these people i've told you about you know lars moravey and drew baglino and others they're saying okay fine that sounds really good but you know it ain't happened yet we need to build a twenty five thousand dollar mass market global car that's just normal with a steering wheel and yeah he finally turned around a few months ago and said let's do it and then he starts focusing on how's the assembly line gonna work how are we gonna do it and make it the same platform for robo taxi so you can have the same assembly on likewise for full self drive they were doing it by coding hundreds of thousands of lines of code that would say things like if you see a red light stop if there's a blinking light if that two yellow lines do this there's a bike lane do this if there's a crosswalk do that well that's really hard to do now he's doing it through artificial intelligence and machine learning only fsd twelve will be based on the billion or so frames from tesla each week of tesla drivers and saying what happened when a human was in this situation what did the human do and let's only pick the best humans the five star drivers uber drivers as elon says and so that's him changing his mind and going to first principles but saying alright i'm even gonna change full self driving so there's not rules based it becomes ai based just like chatgpt doesn't try to answer your question who are the five best popes or something by study chachibidi does it by having ingested billions of of pieces of writing that people have done this will be ai but real world done by ingesting video sometimes it feels like he and others they're building things in this world successfully are are basically confidently exploring a dark room with a very confident ambitious vision of what that room actually looks like like like they're just walking straight into the darkness there's no painful toys or legos on the ground i'm just going to walk i know exactly how far the wall is and then very quickly willing to adjust as they run into they step on the lego and their their body is filled with a lot of pain what i mean by that is there's this kind of evolution that seems to happen where you discover really good ideas along the way that allow you to pivot like to me since you know since a few years ago when you could see with andrej karpathy the software two point o evolution of autopilot it became obvious to me that this is not about the car this is about optimus the robot this this is like if we look back a hundred years from now the car will be remembered as a cool car nice transportation but the the autopilot won't be the thing that controls the car it will be the thing that allows embodied ai systems to understand the world so broadly and so that kind of approach and so and you kinda stumble into it will tesla be a a car company will it be an ai company will it be a robotics company will it be a home robotics company will it be an energy company and then you kind of slowly discover this as you confidently like push forward with a vision so it's interesting to watch that kind of evolution as long as it's backed by this confidence there are couple of things that are required for that one is being adventurous one doesn't enter a dark room without a flashlight and a map unless you're a risk taker unless you're adventurous the second is to have iterative brain cycles where you can process information and do a feedback loop and make it work the third and this is what we failed to do a lot in the united states and perhaps around the world is when you take risks you have to realize you're gonna blow things up you know first three rockets that the falcon rockets that musk does they blow up even starship three and a half minutes but then it blows up the first time so i think boeing and nasa and others have become unwilling to enter your dark room without knowing where the exit is and the lighted path to the exit and the people who created america whenever they came over you know whether the mayflower is refugees from the nazis they took a lot of risks to get here and now i think we have more referees than we have risk takers more lawyers and regulators and others saying you can't do that that's too risky than people willing to innovate and you need both i think you're also right on fifty a hundred years from now what musk will be most remembered for besides space travel is real world ai not just optimus the robot but optimus the robot and the self driving car they're they're pretty much the same they're using you know gpu clusters or dojo chips or whatever it may be to process real world data we all got and you did on your podcast quite excited about large language model you know generative predictive text ai that's fine especially if you wanna chitchat with your chatbot but the holy grail is artificial general intelligence and the tough part of that is real world ai and that's where optimus the robot or full self drive are i think far ahead of anybody else well i like how you said chitchat i i would say for for for one of the greatest writers ever it's funny that you spoke about language and the mastery of language as as merely chitchat you know people have fallen in love over some words people have gone to wars over some words i think words have a lot of power it's actually an interesting question where the wisdom of the world the wisdom of humanity is in words or is it in visual in in visuals is it in the physical i don't really it's in mathematics it may maybe it all boils down to math and in the end this kind of discussion about real world ai versus language is all the same maybe i've gotten a chance to hang out quite a bit in the metaverse with mister mark zuckerberg recently and boy is the realism in there the new like the the thing that's coming up in the future is incredible i got scanned in pittsburgh for ten hours into the metaverse and there's like a virtual version of me and i got to hang out with that virtual version do you like yourself well i i never like myself but it was easier to like that other guy that was interesting does he like you he didn't seem to care much actually lack of the empathy but that was you know it made me start to question even more than before like well how important is this physical reality because i i got to see you know my myself and other people in that metaverse like the details of the face the like all the all the things that you think maybe if you look yourself in the mirror are imperfections all this kind of stuff when i was looking at myself and at others all those things are beautiful and it was like it was real and it was intense and it it it was scary because you're like well are you allowed to murder people in the metaverse because like are you allowed to because what are you allowed to do because you can replicate a lot of those things and it's you start to question what are the fundamental things that make life worth living here as we know as humans have you talked to elon about his views of we're living in a simulation maybe and how you would figure out if that's true yes there's a constant lighthearted but also a serious sense that this is all a bit of a game one of my theories on elon a minor theory is that he read hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy once too often and as you know there's a scene in there that says that there's a theory about the universe that if anybody ever discovers the secrets of meanings of the universe it will be replaced by an even more complex universe and then the next line douglas adams writes is and there's another theory that this has already happened yeah so i i'm gonna try to get my head around that but i know that elon musk tries to well there there's a humor to that there's an enormous humor to hitchhiker's guide and i really think that helped musk out of the darkest of his periods to have sort of the sense of fun of figuring out what life is all about i wonder if this is a small aside we could say just having gotten to know elon very well like his the the silliness the willingness to engage in the absurdity of it all and have fun what is that what is that is that just a quirk of personality or is that a fundamental aspect of a human who's running six plus companies well it's a relief valve just like video games and polytopia and elden ring or release valves for him and he does have an explosive sense of humor as you know and the weird thing is when he makes the abrupt transition from dark demon mode and you're in a conference room and he has really become upset about something and not only their dark vibes but there's dark words emanating and he's saying your resignation will be accepted if you die you know etcetera and then something pops and he pulls out his phone and pulls up a bonnie python's kit you know like the school of silly walks or whichever john cleese it was and then he starts laughing again and things break so it's it's almost as if he has different modes the emulation of human mode the engineering mode the dark and demon mode and certainly there is the silly and giddy mode yeah you've actually opened the elon book with the quotes from elon and from steve jobs so elon's quote is to anyone i've offended i just wanna say this is on snl i just wanna say i reinvented electric cars and i'm sending people to mars on a rocket ship did you also think i was going to be a chill normal dude and then the quote from steve jobs of course is the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do so what do you think is the role of the old madness and genius what do you think the role of crazy in this well first of all let's both stipulate that musk is crazy at times i mean and then let's figure out and i try to do it through storytelling not through highfalutin preaching where that craziness works you know give me a story tell me an anecdote tell me where he's crazy and you know the almost final example ai but him shooting off starship for the first time in between an aborted countdown and the shoot off he goes to miami to an ad sales conference and meets linda yaccarino for the first time makes her the ceo i mean there's a very impulsiveness to him then he flies back they launch starship and you realize that there's a drive and there are demons and there's also craziness and you sometimes wanna pull those out you wanna take away his phone so he doesn't tweet at three am you want to say quit being so crazy but then you realize there's a wonderful line in of shakespeare and measure for measure at the very end he says even the best are molded out of faults and so you take the faults of musk for example which includes a craziness that can be endearing but also craziness that's just like effing crazy as well as this drive and demon mode i don't know that you can take that strand out of the fabric and and the fabric remains whole i wonder sometimes it saddens me that we live in a society that doesn't celebrate even the darker aspects of crazy in acknowledging that it all is comes in one package it's the man in the arena versus the critic and the man in the arena versus the regulator and to make it more prosaic well let me ask about not just the crazy but the cruelty so in you've written when reporting as steve jobs woz told you that the big question to ask was did he have to be so mean so rough and cruel so drama addicted what is this answer for steve jobs did he have to be so cruel for for jobs i asked woz at the end of my reporting because that's what he asked said at the beginning we're doing the launch of i think the ipad two it may have been steve is emaciated because you know he's been sick and so i say to woz what's the answer to your question and he said well if i had been running apple i would have been nicer to everybody i would everybody got stock options we've been like a family and then i yeah i don't know if you know woz we're like a teddy bear he paused he smiled and he said but if i had been running apple i don't think we would have done the macintosh or the iphone so yeah you have to sometimes be rough and jobs said the same thing that musk said to me which is he said people like you love wearing velvet gloves you know i don't know that i've worn velvet gloves often but you like people to like you you like to sweet talk things you sugarcoat things he says i'm just a working class kid and i don't have that luxury if something sucks i gotta tell people it sucks or i got a team of b players well musk is that way as well and it gets back to what i said earlier which is yeah i probably would wear velvet gloves if i could find them at my haberdasher and i do try to sugarcoat things but when i was running cnn yeah it needed to be reshaped it needed to be broken it needed to have certain things blown up yeah and i didn't do it yeah you know so bad on me but it made me realize okay i'll just write about the people who can do it well that thing of saying i think probably both of them but elon certainly saying things like that is the stupidest thing i've ever heard mhmm by the way i've heard jeff bezos say that i've heard bill gates say that i've heard steve jobs say it i've heard steve jobs say it about a smoothie they were making it a whole foods or something i mean people they use the word stupid really often yeah and you know who else used it errol musk he kept making elon stand in front of him and saying that's as stupid as saying you're the stupidest person you'll never amount to anything i don't know you know as john mcneil the president of tesla said do you have to be that way probably not there are a lot of successful people who are much kinder but it's sometimes necessary to be much more brutal and honest brutally honest i would say than people like who are win boss of the year trophies well as you said this kind of idea did also send a signal this idea of steve jobs of a players it did send a signal to everybody it was a kind of encouragement to the people that are all in right and that happened to twitter when we went to twitter headquarters the day before the takeover he was having andrew and james his two young cousins and other people from the autopilot team going over lines of code and musk himself sat there with a laptop on the second floor of the building looking at the lines of code that had been written by twitter engineers and they decided they were gonna fire eighty five percent of them because they had to be all in and this notion of psychological safety and mental days off and working remotely he said either and then it came up actually one of his i think it was one of the cousins or maybe ross nordin came up with the idea of let's not be so rough and just fire all these people let's ask them do you really want to be all in because this is gonna be hardcore it's gonna be intense you get to choose but by midnight tonight we want you to check the box i'm hardcore all in i'll be there in person i'll work you know as much or that's not for me i've got a family i got work balance and you got different type of people that way and different stages of their life i was a little bit more hardcore and all in when i was in my twenties and when i was you know in my fifties yeah and you write about this it's really nice idea actually that there's two camps mhmm and you find out i don't i wonder how true this is it it rings true you can just ask people which camp are you in are you the kind of person that prides themselves and enjoy staying up till two am programming or whatever or do you see the value of quote unquote you know life work life balance all this kind of stuff and it's interesting i mean you like you you could people probably divide themselves in different stages in life and you could just ask them and it makes sense for certain companies in certain stages of their development to be like we all know from teams it doesn't even have to be a whole company and you're right goes back to what i was saying about rule the first secret is sort of know thyself obviously it comes from plato and everything comes from plato and socrates but and decide in this stage of my life am i do i wanna be a hackathon all in all night and change the world or do i want to bring wisdom and stability but also have balance i think it's good to have different companies with different styles the problem was twitter was at almost one extreme with yoga studios and mental health days off and enshrining psychological safety as one of the mantras that people should never feel psychologically threatened and he i remember the bitter laugh he unleashed when he kept hearing that word he said no i like the words hard hardcore i like intensity i like a intense sense of urgency as our operating principle well yeah there are people that way as well so know who you are and know what type of team you wanna build versus psychological safety and too many birds everywhere oh yeah a lot of times musk did things i go what the hell yeah and the problem was changing the name twitter and getting rid of the birds i'm like hey man there's a lot invested in that brand but when i watched him he thought okay these sweet little chirpy birds tweeting away in the name twitter it's not hardcore it's not intense and so for better and for worse i think he's taking x into the hardcore realm with people who post hardcore things with people with hardcore views it's not a polite playpen for the blue checked anointed elite and i thought okay this is gonna be bad the whole thing's gonna fall apart well it has had problems but the hardcore intensity of it has also meant that there's new things happening there so it's very elon musk to not like the sweetness of birds chirping and tweeting and saying i want something more hardcore as you've written in referring to the the previous twitter ceo elon said twitter needs a a fire breathing dragon i think this is a good opportunity to maybe go through some of the memorable moments of the twitter saga as you've written about extensively in your book like from the early days of considering the acquisition to how it went through to the details of like you mentioned the engineering teams well at the beginning of twenty twenty two he was riding high but as we say he's a drama addict he doesn't like to coast and you know tesla sold a million vehicles i think thirty three boosters have you know falcon nines have been shot up and landed safely in the past few months and he was the richest person on earth and time's person of the year and yet he'd said you know i'm still wanna put all my chips back on the table i wanna keep taking risks i don't wanna savor things he had sold all of his houses so he started secretly buying shares of twitter january february march becomes public at a certain point he has to declare it and we were here in austin at gigafactory on the mezzanine and he was trying to figure out well where do i go from here and at that time it's early april they were gonna offer him a board seat he was gonna do a standstill agreement and stop at ten percent or something and i remember you know we were standing around it was luke nosek whom you know well ken howery some of his friends on that mezzanine here and all afternoon and then late into the evening at dinner is like should we do this and i didn't say anything i'm just the observer but everybody else is saying excuse me why do you want to own twitter and griffin his son joined at dinner and may for some reason was in town and like everybody says no we don't use twitter why would you do that and may said well i use twitter and then it's almost like okay the demographics are people my age or may's age and so it looked like he wasn't gonna pursue it they offered him a board seat and then he went off to hawaii to larry ellison's house which he sometimes uses he was meeting a friend angela bassett an actress and instead of enjoying three days of vacation he just became supercharged and started firing off text messages including the fire breathing dragon one i think you know he used that phrase a few times that parag wasn't the person who was going to take twitter to a new level and then by the time he gets to vancouver where grimes meets him they stay up all night playing elden ring he was doing a ted talk and then at five thirty he finishes playing elden ring and sends out that i've made an offer even when he comes back people are trying to intervene and say excuse me why are you doing it and so it was a rocky period between late april and october when the deal closed and people ask me all the time well did he wanna get out of the deal i said which elon are you talking about at what time of day yeah because there'll be times in the morning when he'd say oh the delaware court's gonna force me to do it it's horrible talk to his lawyers you can win this case get me out of it he met here in austin with three or four investment bankers blair efron at centerview bob steele at perella weinberg and they offered him options do you wanna get out do you wanna stay in do you wanna reduce the price and i think his he was mercurial there were times he would text me or say to me this is gonna be great it's gonna be the accelerant to do x dot com the way we thought about twenty years ago and so it's not until they finally tell them at the beginning of october right when optimus the robot is being unveiled in california actually that the lawyer say you're not gonna probably win this case but better go through with the deal and by then he's not only made his peace with it he's kinda happy with it at times eventually the deal is gonna close on i think a friday morning i i have it in the book and we're there on thursday and he's wandering around looking at the stay woke t shirts and psychological safety lingo they're all using and he and his lawyers and bankers hatched a plan to do a flash close and the reason for that was if they close the deal after the markets had closed for the day and he could send a letter to parag and two others firing them quote for cause and this will be something the courts will have to figure out then he could save two hundred million or so and it was both the money but for him a matter i won't say of principle but of hey they misled me about the numbers i got forced into doing it so i'm gonna i'm gonna try this jujitsu maneuver and be able to get some money out of them then when he takes over it's kind of a wild scene him trying to decide in three different rounds how to get the staff down to fifteen percent of what it was him deciding on christmas eve after he'd been at a meeting where they told him we can't get rid of that sacramento server farm because it's needed for redundancy he says no it's not and he's flying here to austin and young james says why don't we just do it ourselves he turns the plane around they land in sacramento and he pulls them out himself so it was a manic period we should also say that underneath of that there was a running desire to or consideration to perhaps start a new companies to build a social media company from scratch well kimball wanted to do that and kimball here at a wonderful restaurant in austin at launch is like hey why are you buying twitter let's start one from scratch and do it on the blockchain yes now it took them a while and you can argue it one way or the other to come to the conclusion that the blockchain was not fast enough in response of time enough to be able to handle a billion tweets you know in a day or so he gets mad when they keep trying to get him to talk to sam bankman friede who's trying to say i'll invest but we have to do it on the blockchain kimbal is still in favor of starting a new one and doing it on blockchain based in retrospect i think starting a new media company would have been better he wouldn't have had the baggage or the legacy that he's breaking now in breaking the way twitter had been but it's hard to have millions and million hundreds of millions of true true users not just trolls and start from scratch as others have found as macedon and blue sky and threads and not i mean threads even had a base so it would have been hard yeah and to do that in the way he did requires another part that you write about with the three musketeers and the whole engineering the firing and the bringing in the engineers to try to sort of go hardcore so there's a lot of interesting sort of questions to ask there but the high level can you just comment about that part of the saga which is bringing in the engineers and seeing like what can we do here right he brought in the engineers and figured that the amount of people doing tesla full self driving autopilot and all the software there was about one tenth of what was doing software for twitter and he said this can't be the case and he fired eighty five percent in three different rounds the first was just firing people because they looked at the coding and they had a team of people from tesla's autopilot team grading the codes of every of all that was written in the past year or so then he fired people you know who didn't seem to be totally all in or loyal and then another round of layoffs so at each step of the way almost everybody said that's enough it's going to destroy things yeah from alex spiro his lawyer to jared birchell he's like woah woah woah you know and even andrew and james the young cousins who are tasked with making a list and figuring out who's good or bad said we've done enough we're going to be in real trouble and they were partly right i mean there was degradation of the service some but not as much as half the services i use half the time you know and i wake up each morning and hit the app and okay still there what do you think was that too much i think that he has an algorithm that we mentioned earlier that begins with question every requirement what's up to is delete delete delete delete every part there and then a corollary to that is if you don't end up adding back twenty percent of what you deleted then you didn't delete enough in the first round because you were too timid well so he asked me did he overdo it he probably overdid it by twenty percent which is his formula and they're probably trying to hire people now to keep things going but it sends a strong signal to people that are hired back or the people that are still there the the ape player idea and what steve jobs and many other great leaders felt and certainly bezos and certainly in the early days of microsoft bill gates it was hardcore only a players so how much of elon's success would you say elon's steve jobs' success is the hiring and managing of great teams when i asked steve jobs at one point what was the best product you ever created i thought he'd say maybe the macintosh or maybe the iphone he said no those products are hard the best thing i ever created was the team that made those products and that's the hard part is creating a team and he did you know from johnny ive to tim cook and eddie cue and phil shiller elon has done a good job bringing in people gwen shotwell obviously linda yacarino she's you know can navigate through the current crises certainly stellar people at spacex like marc jinkosso and then at tesla like drew baglino and lars moravey and tom zhu and many others he's not as much of a team collaborator as a benjamin franklin mhmm who by the way that's the best team ever created which is the founders and you had to have really smart people like jefferson and madison and really passionate people like john adams and his cousin samuel and really a guy of high rectitude like washington but you also needed a ben franklin who could bring everybody together and forge a team out of them and make them compromise with each other musk is a magnet for awesome talent magnet interesting but there's there's like the priorities of hiring of based on excellence trustworthiness and drive these are things you've described yeah throughout the book i mean there there's a pretty concrete and rigorous set of ideas based on which the hiring is done oh yeah and he has a very good spidey intuitive sense just looking at people who could i mean not looking at them but studying them who could be good one of his ways of operating is what he calls a skip level meeting and let's take a very specific thing like the raptor engine which is powering the starship mhmm and it wasn't going well it looked like a spaghetti bush and it was gonna be hard to manufacture and he got rid of the people who were in charge of that team mhmm and i remember that he spent a couple of months doing what he calls skip level which means instead of meeting with his direct reports on the raptor team he would meet with the people one level below them and so he would skip a level and meet with them and he said this is and i just ask them what they're doing and i drill them with questions and he said this is how i figure out who's going to emerge he said it was particularly difficult i was sitting in those meetings because people were wearing masks it was during the height of covid mhmm and he said it made it a little bit harder for him because he has to mhmm get the input but i watched as a young kid dreadlocks named jacob mckenzie he's in the book he's sitting there and he's a bit like you engineering mindset speaks in a bit of a monotone musk would ask a question and he would give an answer and the answer would be very straightforward and he didn't you know get rattled he was like this and ma said one day called him up at three am well i won't say three am but after midnight said you still around yeah jake said yeah i'm still at work and he said okay i'm gonna make you in charge of the team building raptor and that was like a big surprise but jacob mckenzie has now gotten a version of raptor and where they're building them at least one a week and they're pretty awesome and that's where his talent musk's talent for finding the right person and promoting them that's where it is and promoting it in a way where it's like a here's the ball here catch yeah yeah and you run with it i have i've interacted with quite a few folks from even just the model x the the all throughout where people you know on paper don't seem like they would be able to run the thing and they run it extremely successfully and he does it wrong sometimes he's had a horrible track record with the solar roof division wonderful guy named brian dow i really liked him and when they were doing the battery factory surge in nevada musk got rid of two or three people and there's brian dow can do can do can do stays up all night and he gets promoted and runs it and so finally goes musk goes through two or three people running the solar roof division finally calls up brian dow i was sitting in musk's house in boca chica that little tiny two bedroom he has and he offers brian dow the job of running solar roof and you know brian there okay can do can do and two or three times musk insisted that they put install a solar roof in one of those houses in boca chica this is this tiny village at the south end of texas and late at night i mean i'd have to climb up to the top of the roof on these ladders and stand on this peaked roof as musk is there saying why do we need four screws to put in this single leg and and brian was just sweating and doing everything but then after a couple of months it wasn't going well and boom musk just fired him so i always try to learn what is it that makes those who stay thrive what's the lesson there what do you think well i think it's self knowledge like an andy krebs or others they say i am hardcore i really want to get a rocket to mars and that's more important than anything else one of the people i think it's i think it's tim zaman i hope when he hears this i'm getting him the right person who you know took time and was working for tesla autopilot and it was just so intense he took some time off and and then went to another company he said i was burned out at tesla but then i was bored at the next place so i called i think it was ashok ten said can i come back he said sure yeah he said i've learned about myself i'd rather be burned out than bored that's a good line well can you just linger on one of the three that seem interesting to you in in terms of excellence trustworthiness and drive which one do you think is is the most important and the hardest to get at the trustworthiness is an interesting one like are you ride or die kind of thing yeah i think that especially when it came to taking over twitter he thought half the people there were disloyal yeah and he was wrong about two thirds were disloyal not just half and it was how do we weed out those and he did something and made the firing squad i call it or the musketeers i think is my nickname for them which is you know the young cousins and two or three other people he made them look at the slack messages these people had post everybody at twitter had posted and they went through hundreds of slack messages so if anybody posted on the internal slack you know that jerk elon musk is gonna take over and i'm afraid that he's a maniac or something they would be on the list because they want all in loyal they did not look at private slack messages and i guess people who are posting on a corporate slack board should be aware that your company can look at them but that's more than i would have done or most people would have done and so that was to figure out who's deeply committed and loyal i think that was mainly the case at twitter he doesn't sit around at spacex saying who's loyal to me at other places it's excellent but that's pretty well a given everybody is like a marc jinkosa just whip smart it's are you hardcore and all in especially if you got to move to this spit of a town in the south tip of texas called boca chica you know you gotta be all in yeah and that's the drive the the last piece so you terms of collaborating one of the great teams of all time ben franklin i like that thought it was the beatles but ben franklin is is pretty good no no no oh no i'm sorry sorry yeah sorry to offend you so much read the constitution and read abbey road listen to abbey road they're both good but they're in a different league yeah different league okay so one of the many things that comes to mind with ben franklin is incredible time management mhmm is there something you could say about ben franklin and about steve jobs i think interesting with elon is that he as you write runs six companies seven i mean it depends how you count with starlink is its own thing i don't know what can you say about these people in terms of time management well musk is in a league of his own in the way he does it first of all steve jobs had to run pixar and apple for a while but musk every couple of hours is switching his mindset from how to implant the neuralink chip and what will the robot that implants it in the brain look like and how fast can we make it move and then the heat shield on the raptor or switching to human imitation machine learning full self drive on the night that the twitter board agreed to the deal this is huge around the world i'm sure you remember like musk buys twitter it wasn't when the deal closed it was when the twitter accepted his offer and i thought okay but then he went to boca chica to south texas and spent time fixating on if i remember correctly a valve in the raptor engine that had a methane leak issue and what were the possible ways to fix it and all the engineers in that room i assume are thinking about this guy just bought twitter should we say something and he's like and then he goes with kimball to a roadside joint in brownsville and just sits in the front and listens to music with nobody noticing really him being there one of the things that's one of his strengths and sort of weaknesses in a way is in a given day he'll focus serially sequentially on many different things he will worry about uploading video onto x dot com or the payment system and then immediately switch over to some issue with the faa giving a permit for starship or with how to deal with starlink and the cia and when he's focused on any of these things you cannot distract him it's not like he's also thinking about dealing with starlink but i've got to also worry about the tesla decision on the new twenty five thousand dollars car now he'll in between these sessions process information then let off steam and for better or worse he lets off steam by either playing a friend in politopia or fire off some tweets which is often not a healthy thing but it's a release for him and he doesn't i once said he was a great multitasker and that was a mistake people corrected me he's a serial tasker which means focuses intensely on a task for an hour almost has a whatever they call it at restaurants where they give you a pallet palate cleanser yes he does some palate cleanser with polytopia yeah and then focuses on the next task i mean is there some wisdom about time management that you can draw from that there's some things that these people do and you say okay i can be that way i can be more curious i can question every rule and regulation i just don't think anybody should try to emulate musk's time management style because it takes a certain set of teams who know how to deal with everything else other than the thing he's focusing on and a certain mind that can shift just like his moods can shift you and i go through transitions and also if i'm thinking about what i'm gonna say on this podcast i'm also thinking about the email my daughter just sent about a house that she's looking you know and i'm i'm multitasking he doesn't actually do that he single tasks sequentially with a focus that's hardcore i don't know i think there's wisdom to draw from that to like first of all he makes me ben franklin makes me feel that way that there's a lot of hours in the day mhmm there's a lot of minutes in the day like there's no excuse not to get a lot done and that requires just an extreme focus an extreme focus and like an urgency i think the fierce urgency that drives him is important and it's sometimes ginned up like i say the fierce urgency of getting to mars and on a friday night at the launch pad in boca chica at ten pm there are only a few people working because it's a friday night they're not supposed to launch for another eight months and he orders a surge he says i want two hundred people here by tomorrow working on this pad we have to have a fierce sense of urgency or we will never get to mars that sense of urgency you know is also a vibrancy that's like really taking on life fully i mean that to me that's the lesson is like even the mundane can be full of this just richness and like you just have to really take it in intensely so like the switching enables that kind of intensity because most of us can't hold that intensity in any one task for a prolonged period of time maybe that's also a lesson right and i guess it goes back to also know who you are meaning know who you are there are people who can focus intensely and there are people who can see patterns across many things look leonardo da vinci he was not all that focused he was easily distracted procrastinated it's why he has more unfinished paintings than finished paintings in his canon yeah but his ability to see patterns across nature and to in some ways process procrastinate be distracted that helped him some but musk is not that way and there every few months there's a new surge you you don't know where it'll be but you'll be on solar roofs and all of a sudden we'll have a surge and there has to be you know a hundred solar roofs built or this has to be done by tomorrow or make a starship dome by dawn and surge and do it and there are people who are built that way it is inspiring but also let's appreciate you know that there are people who can be really good but also can savor the success savor the moment savor the quiet sometimes musk's big failing is he can't savor the moment or success and that's the flip side of hardcore intensity in innovators another book of yours that i love you write about individuals and about groups so one of the questions the book addresses is is it individuals or is it groups that turn the tides of history when henry kissinger was on the shuttle missions for the middle east peace this is the first book i ever wrote he said when i was a professor at harvard i thought that history was determined by great forces and groups of people but when i see it up close i see what a difference an individual can make he's talking about sadat and golda meir probably talking about himself too or at least in his mind and we biographers have this dirty secret that we know we distort history a bit by making the narrative too driven by an individual but sometimes it is driven by an individual musk is a case like that and sometimes as i did with the innovators there's teams and people who build on each other and gordon moore and bob noyce then getting andy grove and doing the microchip which then comes out and wozniak and jobs find it at some electronics store and they decide to build the apple and so sometimes there are flows of forces and groups of people i guess i air a little bit on the side of looking at what a steve jobs and elon musk and albert einstein can do and i also try to figure out if they hadn't been around would the forces of history and the groups of people have done it without them that's a good historical question as you know somebody who loves history and you think about special relativity one of the nineteen o five papers even after he writes it it's four years before people truly get what he's saying which is it's not just how you observe time is relative it's time itself is relative and on the general theory which he does a decade later i'm not sure we would have gotten that yet what about moving us into the era of an iphone in which it's so beautiful that you can't live without a thousand songs in your pocket email and the internet in your pocket and a phone there are a lot of brain dead people from panasonic to motorola who didn't get that and it may have been a while i certainly think it's true of the era of electric vehicles jim and ford all the great people there they crushed the bolt and i mean that literally they ended up smashing them because they decided to discontinue it likewise nobody was sending up rockets our space shuttle was about to be grounded twelve years ago and so musk does things and there'll be people who say and read the book well if they read the book they'll see the full story well they say it wasn't musk who did tesla it was martin eberhard or mark tarpenning no no no you know there were people who had helped create you know the shells of companies and other things and they were all deserved to be called cofounders but the guy who actually gets us to a million electric vehicles a year is elon musk and without him i don't think we look if anybody five years from now buys a car that's gasoline powered will think that's quaint you know that's odd i mean suddenly we've changed we're not gonna do it ninety percent of that is elon musk we're all mortal when and how do you think elon will retire from the insanely productive schedule he's on now i would think that he would hate to retire i think that he can't live without the pressure the drama the all in feeling it's never been anything that seemed to have crossed his mind he's never said maybe i love larry ellison's house on the beach in hawaii maybe i should spend time in doing instead he says things like i learned early on that vacations will kill you he gets malaria when he goes on one vacation i mean he goes on vacation at one point and they oust him from paypal and then he goes to africa at one point he gets malaria he says i've learned vacations kill you lesson learned well it's interesting because the projects are hundred plus year projects many of these one of the weird things is watching him think incredibly long term one of the meetings every week early on when i was watching him was mars colonizer and we did through a two hour meeting about what would the governance structure be on mars what would people wear how would the robots work and would there be democracy or should there be a different form of governance i'm sitting there saying what are they doing what are they talking about they're trying to build rocket ships and everything else they are worrying about the governance structure of mars and likewise whenever he's in a tense moment like there's a rocket's about to be launched he'll start asking people about something in the way future like the new leed engine or something if we're gonna build that do we have enough materials ready to order or i don't know he'll just ask questions like when he's building robotaxi the global car the twenty five thousand dollars inexpensive global car that's not a total passion he was talked into doing that his passion is robo taxis but his passion is how are we gonna make this factory to do a million cars a year so even the robo taxi is a longer range vision i mean he's been touting it since twenty sixteen but you know we're not i don't know robotaxis i mean there's waymo maybe doing a little experiments but there's not cars being manufactured without steering wheels that are going to take over the highways yet so he's always looking way into the future is my point i just hope that there's a lot of da vinci's and steve jobs's and einsteins and elon musk's that carry the the flame forward that's one of the reason you write books about these people is so that if you're a young woman in a school where you're not being told to do science and you read the code breaker about jennifer doudna you say okay i can be that and when you say oh maybe i'll be a regulator or a bureau you say oh no maybe i'll be the person who pushes the boundaries who pushes the lines who pushes as steve jobs said the human race well let me ask you about your mind your genius your process i'll give you a two out of three alright take me through your process of writing a biography i mean the the the full of it and not not just writing a biography but understanding deeply which your books have done for the human story and like the bigger ideas underlying the human story so you've written biographies both of individuals which are hardly individuals mhmm it's a really big complex picture and biographies of ideas that involve individuals well step one for me is trying to figure out how the mind works what causes einstein to make that leap elon musk to say stainless steel while he's looking at a carbon fiber rock rocket or how do you make the mental leap because i write about smart people but smart people are a dime a dozen they don't usually amount to much you have to be creative imaginative to think different as jobs would say and so what makes people creative what makes them take imaginative leaps that's the key question you gotta ask you also ask the questions like you've asked earlier which is what demons are jangling in their head and how do they harness them into drives so you look at all that and you try to observe really carefully the person one of the more mundane things i do is a lot of writers try to give you a lot of their opinions and preach or whatever as i said this mentor said two people types come out preachers storytellers to be a storyteller i try whenever i'm trying to convey a thought there's six magic words that i almost should have written on a card pinned above my desk which is let me tell you a story so if somebody says how does elon musk figure out good talent as you did i think well let me tell you the story i'll tell you the story of jake mckenzie or this is not something i invented i mean this is the way the good lord does it in the bible i mean has the best opening lead sentence ever you know in the beginning comma and then it's stories and secondly to pick up on that lead sentence in the beginning make it chronological mhmm everybody in the fortieth year of their life has grown from the thirty ninth year and the thirty eighth year and so you want to show how people evolve and grow i had the greatest of all nonfiction narrative editors alice mayhew at simon shuster who among other things created all the president's men with woodward and bernstein but she had a note she'd put in the margins of my books that was a tigta and it meant all things in good time keep it chronological if it's good enough for the bible it's good enough for you interesting to me like that's a small note but to you it's it's extremely important because it's the framework for how you structure things but also how you understand things which is if you keep it a chronological narrative then you're showing how a person has grown from one experience you've told talked about to the next one and that moral growth creative growth risk taking growth wisdom that's the essences of creativity but you can't do it you know there's a term bildungsroman you know which is a you know book of you know that carries a narrative and tells how people learn something i'm a big believer in narrative if you're an academic you sometimes not today but in like twenty years ago thirty years ago there were two things you thought were bad one was having a great person theory of history in which you decide to do biography i had a great professor when i was in college her name was doris kearns she later married dick goodwin and she when she was going for tenure at the university wrote a biography of lyndon johnson and the american dream and they denied her tenure because it was beneath the dignity of the academy to write history through one person that's great it opened up the field of biography to us non academics starting with david mccullough bob caro but maybe don meacham and myself are in a new generation and certainly there's a generation coming after us but the second thing besides telling it through people which is the academy tended to disdain what they called imposing a narrative in which you made it storytelling because that meant you were leaving things out and making it into a narrative well that's how we form our views of the world well let me ask you this question in terms of gathering an understanding how much of it is one observing and how much of it is interviews yeah and obviously it depends on the subject i mean with a ben franklin it's all based on archives and every of course we have forty volumes of letters he wrote that was a good old days when every day you'd write twenty letters the musk book is based much more on observation than almost any of my books because he opened up in a way that was breathtaking to me you know even when he'd be sitting playing polytopia or seething at other people you know he had me just sitting there watching i mean i spent a lot of time with jennifer dowden at her side i went to her lab and edited a human gene and you know with a pipette in a test tube but i would say i spent thirty hours with her i can't count you know hundred hours or more just observing musk and i'm not sure that any biographer perhaps since boswell took on doctor johnson has ever had quite as much up close meaning five feet away at all times access and because of that i'll go back to what i said a moment ago i try to get out of the way of the story it's not about me it's not about i try to just say okay here's what happened here's this story here's what happened the night he came in to twitter for the first time and let you form your own judgment what about the interviews you've had a lot of conversations you give acknowledgment to the people you've you've done interviews with well one i have to ask as an aspiring interviewer myself how people love to talk people just love you know that and i've had one hundred and forty maybe one hundred and fifty people they're all listed in the back one of the little things that people won't notice but i'll say it now is all of them are on the record getting them to talk is easy they all want to talk about musk but then at a certain point say i don't put anonymous quotes in my book i cite things i say if you're tough enough and you've gone through this and a lot of times it takes two or three calls back somebody will tell me sorry say oh no no no i don't want to but i think it's important to know where everything came from and with musk it's you know i had that from the very beginning because i was a time magazine reporter i'd worked a reporter for the times picayune on new orleans i first day on the job i had to go cover a murder and i phoned in the story from a payphone and my editor you know the city editor said well did you talk to the family i went no billy i mean the family you know daughter just got he said go knock on the door i knocked on the door an hour later they were still talking they were bringing out her yearbooks lesson one i learned people want to talk if you're willing to just listen and whether it be henry kissinger you just push the button and say kissinger and people tell you the stories all the way through elon musk everybody talked everybody in his family everybody he fired everybody i mean i think it's important to listen to people and the other thing i learned as a reporter back when i was covering politics in new hampshire in the early campaigns i learned from two or three great reporters a guy named david broder and tim russert the late nbc guy they do what was called door knocking you just walk in the neighborhood knock on a door and ask people about the election but they said here's the secret don't ask any leading questions don't have any premise just say hey i'm trying to figure out this election what's going on what do you think mhmm and then stay silent with musk a third secret you know this well he'll go silent at times sometimes a minute two minutes four minutes don't try to fill the silences if you're a listener you gotta learn okay he's not saying anything for four minutes i can outlast him it's tough as humans it's very tough respecting the silence is really really difficult mhmm speaking of demons when there's silence all the demons show up in my head oh yeah the fear i think is if i if i don't say anything it's boring and if i say something it's gonna be stupid and that that that the basic engine that just keeps running not on the podcast well on the podcast but also in human interaction and so i think there's that nervous energy when interacting with people you can never go wrong by staying silent if if there's nothing you have to say not something i've mastered but i do when i'm a reporter try to master that which is don't don't ask complex questions don't interject and when somebody hasn't fully answered the question don't say well let me you know i haven't just stay silent and then they'll keep talking just give them a chance to keep talking even if they've kind of finished yeah still sometimes they haven't given you enough instead of following up i'll just nod and keep waiting you're making it sound simple is there a secret to getting people to open up more i'm somewhat lucky because you know i started off working for a daily newspaper and people back then they wanna talk to the newspaper reporter but you also have a way about you like i feel like you have like a cowboy in a saloon like you just kinda wanna talk like there's a draw i don't know i don't know what it is maybe that's i don't know if it's developed or you're born with it but there's a it feels like i wanna tell you a story of some sort good tell me a story a couple of things i did learn to be more quiet i'm sure i know when i was younger or even i'll see videos of me at you know news things where i'm always trying to interject a question and so you learn to be quieter sometimes i haven't mastered it i haven't learned it enough you learn to be naturally curious many reporters today when they ask a question or either trying to play gotcha or trying to get a news scoop or trying to you know gig something that can make a lead and if you actually are curious and you really want to know the answer to a question then people can tell that you asked it because you want the answer not because you're playing a game with them so i'm sure some of them off the record some of them on the record you had maybe you know just some incredible conversations i was gonna say some of the greatest conversations ever but who knows some of the best conversations ever are probably somewhere in south america between yeah two drunk people that we never get to hear so i don't i don't know but is there advice you can give from what you've learned to somebody like me on how to have good conversation especially when it's recorded well to be actually curious i mean every question you've asked me is because i think you actually want to know the answer and you've done your homework to be open and not to have an agenda i mean we all suffer from there being too many agendas in the world today yeah so that is just genuine curiosity but there's something when you talk about just one on one interaction whether it's elon or steve jobs or there's something beautiful about that person's mind and it feels like it's possible to reveal that to discover that together efficiently and that's kind of the goal of a conversation well i mean look you're amongst the top podcasters and interviewers you know in the world today you have an earnestness to you ben franklin is the person who taught me i mean by reading him the most about on conversation he wrote a wonderful essay on that it includes on silence but it includes trying to ask sincere questions rather than get a point across i mean it's somewhat socratic but whenever he wondered wanted to like start a fireman's corps in philadelphia he would go to his group that he called the leather apron club and they would pose a question why don't we have it what would it take what would be good and then the second part is to make sure that you listen and if somebody has even just the germ of an idea give them credit for it like as joe said you know the real problem is this and i do think that if i'm in situations and i just mean even at dinner or something and i'm with somebody i'm usually curious and i'll the conversation will proceed you know with with questions and i guess it's also because i'm pretty interested in what anybody's doing whoever i happen to be with and so you that's a talent you you have which is you're pretty genuine in your interests there are people like benjamin franklin like the i'll say charlie rose even though he's in disfavor who are interested in a huge number of subjects and i think that helps as well to be interested in basketball and opera and physics and metaphysics that was a ben franklin that was a leonardo trick which is they wanted to know everything you could possibly know about every subject knowable mhmm but there's a different aspect of this which is that i would i would love to hear how you've solved it or if you faced it that you're certainly disarming see i'm like peppering you with compliments here trying to get you that's a very disarming method yeah i've recently talked to benjamin netanyahu we'll we'll talk again we unfortunately because of scheduling and complexities only had one hour which is very difficult mhmm very difficult with the charismatic talk mister i understand this but he's also a charismatic talker which is very difficult to break through in one hour but there people have built up walls whether it's because of demons or because of their politicians and so they have agendas and narratives and so on and so to to break through those i wonder if there's some advice some wisdom you've learned on how to sort of wear down through water or whatever whatever method the the walls that we've built up as individuals i mean you call it disarming which i don't know that i am but disarming basically means you're taking down their shields also and you know when people have a shield and you try to give them comfort i had zero of that problem with elon musk i mean it was like disarming to me which is i kept waiting to say okay he's not going to he's got a shell or he won't do that but he was almost crazily open and did not seem to wanna be spinning or hiding or faking things and i've been lucky doudna was that way steve jobs was that way but you have to put in time too in other words you can't say okay there's a one hour interview and i'm gonna break down every wall it's like on your fifth visit yes well actually that's one of the things in my situation you learn fifth visit is very nice but sometimes you don't get a fifth visit sometimes it's just the first date and i think what it boils down to and and we said disarming but there's something about this person that you trust i think a lot of it just boils down to trust in some deep human way and i think with with with many of the people i've spoken with sometimes the trust happens like after the interview which is really sad because it's like oh man i've never been in your situation where i have a show i usually have me second year at the wheel yes i i'm not a first date person yeah yeah yeah well you know but then i'm lucky i mean i mean i say lucky but i'm in print you know i understand print is a couple thousand year old medium but there are those of us who love it well the nature of the podcast medium is that i'm a one one night stand kinda girl let me ask you about objectivity you followed elon and you followed like you're you've you've i mean i don't even know if you would say your front you have to be careful with words like that but you're there's an intimacy and how do you remain objective do you want to remain objective while telling a deeply human story yeah i mean i want to be honest which i think is akin to being objective i try to keep in mind who's who am i writing for i'm not writing for elon musk as i say haven't sent him the book i don't know if he i don't think he's read it yet i've got one person i'm writing for the open minded reader and if i can put in a story and say well that will piss off the subject or that won't really make the subject happy that's irrelevant or i try to make that a minor consideration it's will the reader have a better understanding because i've put this story in the book i'm a bit of a romantic so to me even your einstein book yeah had lessons on on romance and relationships oh dear so how important are romantic relationships to the success of great men great women great minds well sometimes people who affect the course of humanity have better relationships with humanity than they do with the humans sitting around them einstein had two interesting relationships with wives his you know maleva his first wife was a sounding board and helped with the mathematics of the special relativity paper in particular but he didn't treat her well i mean he made her like sign a letter that she wouldn't interrupt him she wouldn't you know and finally when she wanted a divorce he couldn't afford it because he was still a patent clerk and so he offered her a deal which is i think totally amazing he said one of these days one of those papers from nineteen o five is going to win the nobel prize if we get a divorce you know i'll give you the money that was a lot of money back then like a million dollars now or something and she's smart she's a scientist she consults with a few other scientists and after a week or so she takes the bet it's not until what nineteen nineteen that he wins his nobel prize and she gets all the money she buys three apartment buildings in zurich with his second wife elsa it was more a partnership of convenience it was not a romantic love but he knew and that's sometimes what people need in life is just a partner i mean somebody who's gonna handle the stuff you're not gonna handle so i guess if you look at my books they're not great inspiring guides to personal relationships let me ask you about actually the process of writing itself when you've observed when you've listened when you've collected all the information what's maybe even just the silly mundane question of what do you eat for breakfast before you start writing when do you write first of all breakfast is not my favorite meal and those people who tell you that you have to start with a hearty breakfast i wrong look askins yes and morning is not my favorite day part so i write at night and because i love narrative it's easy to structure a book which is i can make a outline that if i printed it out or notes would be a hundred pages but everything's in order in other words if we serve if there's a burning man and he's coming back from grimes and then there's a solar roof thing and then there's something i put it all in order day by day as an outline and that disciplines me when i'm starting to write to follow the mantra from alice mayhew my first editor which is all things in good time don't get ahead of the story don't have to flashback and then after you get it so that it's all chronological you know things then you have to do some clustering you know you have to say okay we're going to do the decision to do starship or to build a factory in texas or to whatever and then you sometimes have the organizational problem of yeah and that gets us all the way up to here do i keep that in this that chapter or do i wait until later when it's better chronologically but those are easy well what about the actual process of telling the story well that's the mantra i mentioned earlier which is whenever i get pause or i don't know how to say something i just say let me tell you a story and then i find the actual anecdote the story the tale that encompasses what i'm trying to convey and then i don't say what i'm trying to convey i don't have a transition sentence that says you know elon sometimes changed his mind so often he couldn't remember whether he had changed his mind you know you don't you don't need transition sentences you just say all right here's the point i need to make next and so you start with a sentence that says you know one day in january in the factory in texas comma well one of the things i'd i'd love to ask you is for advice for for young people to me first advice would be to read biographies in a sense because they help you understand of all the different ways you can live a life well lived but from having written biographies having studied so many great men and women what advice could you give to people of how to live this this life well i keep going back to the classics and plato and aristotle and socrates and i guess it's plato's maxim but he may be quoting socrates that the unexamined life is not worth living and it gets back to the know thyself which is you don't have to figure out what is the big meaning of it all but you have to figure out why you're doing what you're doing and that requires something that i did not have enough of when i was young which is self awareness and examining every motive everything i do where does the examination lead you is it to to to a shift in in life's trajectory i mean it's not for me sort of alright i've now decided having been a journalist i'll run a think tank or i'll run a network or i'll write a bio it is actually something that's more useful on an hourly basis like why am i about to say that to somebody or why am i going to do this particular act what's my true motive here and also in the broader sense to learn as i did after a couple years at cnn i my examination of my life is that i'm not great at running complex organizations i'm not great as a manager given the choice i'd rather somebody else have to manage me than me have to manage people but it took me a while to figure that out and i was probably too ambitious when i was young and at time magazine that was when i was green and oh well that was when i was in my salad days and green and judgment and it was like chasing the next level at time incorporated whatever it might be and then one day i caught the brass ring and i became an editor and then the top editor and after a while i realized that wasn't really totally what i'm suited to be especially when i got put in charge of cnn i mean all young people are almost by definition in their salad days and green in judgment but you learn what's motivating you and then you learn to ask but is that really what i want should i be careful of what i'm wishing for one of the big examinations you can do is the fact that you and everybody dies one day how much you walter isaacson think about death are you afraid of it no and i don't think about it a lot but i do think about steve jobs' let me tell you a story you know which is the wonderful steve jobs story of i think after he was diagnosed but before it was public and he gave both a stanford talk but other things in which he said the fact that we are going to die gives you focus and gives you meaning if you're going to live and elon musk has said that to me which is a lot of the tech bros out in the silicon valley that are looking for ways to live forever forever i can think musk says of nothing worse we read the myth of sisyphus and we know how bad it is to be condemned to eternal life so there was in ancient greece the person who walked behind the king and said memento mori remember you're gonna die and it kept people from losing it a bit do you think about legacy the lucky thing about being a biographer is that you kind of know what your legacy is there's going to be a shelf and it'll be of interesting people and you will have inspired a seventeen year old biology student somewhere to be you know the next great biochemist or somebody to start a company like elon musk and what i think more about i won't say giving back that's such a trade thing i moved back to new orleans for a reason first of all the hurricane hit and after katrina i was asked to be vice chair of the recovery authority and i realized everything i've got going for me it all comes from this beautiful gem of a troubled city the wonderful high school i went to the wonderful streets where i learned to ride a bike you know and it's got challenges i'm never gonna solve challenges at the grand global level but i can go back home and say part of my legacy is going to be i tried to pay it back to my hometown even by teaching it to tulane which i don't do as a favor i mean i enjoy the hell out of it but it's like alright i'm part of a community and i think we lose that in america because people who are lonely are lonely because they're not part of a community but i've got all my high school kids their friends they're all still in new orleans i've got my family but i also have tulane institutions in new orleans that have been there forever and if i can get involved in helping the school system in new orleans of helping the youth empowerment programs of helping the innovation center at tulane i was even on the city planning commission which worries about zoning ordinances for short term rentals you know go figure but it was like no immerse myself in my community because my community was just so awesomely good at allowing me to become who i became and has trouble year by year hurricane by hurricane making sure that each new generation can be creative and it's a city of creativity from jazz to the food to the architecture so when i think of i won't say legacy but what am i going to do to pay it forward which is a lower level way of saying legacy i pay it forward by going back to the place where i began and trying to know it for the first time that was a rip off of a t s eliot line i don't want you to think i thought of that one always cite your sources i appreciate it ts eliot if you ever need to figure it out the four quartets there's that part at the end which is we shall not cease from exploration and the end of all of our exploring will be to return to the place we started and know it for the first time to the unknown but half remembered gate it's just beautiful and that's been an inspiration of what do you do in i guess if it's a shakespeare play you'd call it act five well you go back to the place where you came and see for the purpose sit there worrying about legacy but you'll sit there saying how do i make sure that somebody else can have a magical trajectory starting in new orleans well to me you're one of the greatest storytellers of all time i've been a huge fan definitely not true but it's so sweet of you you see you can be brutally interrupting it's just the from i think probably ben franklin so for i don't know how many years fifteen years einstein all the way through today has been a huge fan of yours and you're one of the people that i thought surely would not lower themselves
