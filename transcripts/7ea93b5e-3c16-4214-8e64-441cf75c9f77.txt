the following is a conversation with robert f kennedy junior candidate for the president of the united states running as a democrat robert is an activist lawyer and author who has challenged some of the world's most powerful corporations seeking to hold them accountable for the harm they may cause i love science and engineering these two pursuits are to me the most beautiful and powerful in the history of human civilization science is our journey our fight for uncovering the laws of nature and leveraging them to understand the universe and to lessen the amount of suffering in the world some of the greatest human beings i've ever met including most of my good friends are scientists and engineers again i love science but science cannot flourish without epistemic humility without debate both in the pages of academic journals and in the public square in good faith long form conversations agree or disagree i believe robert's voice should be part of the debate to call him a conspiracy theorist and arrogantly dismiss everything he says without addressing it diminishes the public's trust in the scientific process at the same time dogmatic skepticism of all scientific output on controversial topics like the pandemic is equally if not more dishonest and destructive i recommend that people read and listen to robert f kennedy junior his arguments and his ideas but i also recommend as i say in this conversation that people read and listen to vincent racaniello from this week in virology dan wilson from debunk the funk and the twitter and books of paul offit eric topol and others who are outspoken in their disagreement with robert it is disagreement not conformity that bends the long arc of humanity toward truth and wisdom in this process of disagreement everybody has a lesson to teach you but we must have the humility to hear it and to learn from it and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to

lex this is the lex fridman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's robert f kennedy jr it's the fourth of july independence day so simple question simple big question what do you love about this country the united states of america i would say there are so many things that i love about the country on you know the landscapes and the waterways and the people etcetera but on the kind of a you know the higher level you know people argue about whether we're an exemplary nation and the that term has been given a bad name particularly by the neocons the actions of the neocons in in recent decades who have turned that that phrase into kind of a justification for forcing people to adopt american systems or values at the at the barrel of a gun but my father and uncle used it in a very different way and they were very proud of it i grew up very proud of this country because we were the ex exemplary nation in in in the sense that we were an example of democracy all over the world when we when we first launched our democracy in seventeen eighty we were the only democracy on earth and by the civil war by eighteen sixty five there were six democracies today there's probably a hundred and ninety and all of them in one way or another are modeled on on the american experience and it's kind of extraordinary because sort of our our first contact with our first serious and sustained contact with the european culture and continent was in sixteen o eight when john winthrop came over with his puritans in the sloop arbela and winthrop gave this famous speech where he said this is gonna be a city on a hill this is gonna be an example for you know all the other nations in the world and he he warned his fellow puritans they were you know sitting at the at this great expanse of land he said we can't be we can't be seduced by the the lure of real estate or by the carnal opportunities of this land we have to take this country as a gift from god and then turn it into a an example for the rest of the world of of god's love of god's will and and wisdom and and and you know to two hundred years later two hundred and fifty years later they a different generation they're mainly deists they're people who had a a belief in god but not so much a love of particularly religious cosmologies you know the framers of the constitution believe that we were creating something that would be replicated around the world and that it was an example it would in democracy there would be this kind of wisdom from the collective you know that and the word wisdom means a knowledge of god's will and that somehow god would speak through the collective in a way that that he or she could not speak through you know through totalitarian regimes and you know i think that that's something that even though winthrop was a white man and a protestant that every immigrant group who came after them kind of adopted that belief and i know my family when you know my family came over all of my grandparents came over in eighteen forty eight during the potato famine and they saw this country as unique in history as something that you know that was that was part of kind of a broader spiritual mission and so i i'd say that from a thirty thousand foot level that you know that's i grew up so proud of this country and believing that it was the greatest country in the world and for those reasons well i immigrated to this country and one of the things that really embodies america to me is the ideal of freedom hunter thompson said freedom is something that dies unless it's used what does freedom mean to you to me freedom does not mean you know chaos and it does not mean anarchy it means that it it it it has to be accompanied by restraint if it's going to live up to its promise in self restraint what it means is the capacity for human beings to to exercise and to fulfill their their creative energies unrestrained as much as possible by government so this point that hunter estancos made is dies unless it's used do you agree with that yeah i do agree with that and i you know i he'd he was not unique in saying that you know thomas jefferson said that the tree of liberty has to be had to be watered with the blood of each generation and what he meant by that is that it's it's you can't live off we can't live off the laurels of the american revolution that you know we had a group we had a generation where between twenty five thousand and seventy thousand americans died they gave their lives they gave their livelihoods they gave their status they gave their property and they put it all on the line to give us our bill of rights and that but those bill of rights the moment that we signed them there were forces within our society that began trying to chip away at them and that you know happens in every generation and it is the obligation of every generation to safeguard and protect those freedoms the blood of each generation you mentioned your interest your admiration of albert camus of stoicism perhaps your interest in existentialism camus said i believe in myth of sisyphus the only way to deal with a non free world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion what do you think he means by that i suppose the way that camus viewed the world and the way that the stoics did and a lot of the existentialists was that it was that it was so absurd and that the the the problems and the tasks that were given just to live a life are so insurmountable that the only way that we can kind of get back the gods for giving us this you know this this impossible task of of living life was to embrace it and to enjoy it and to do our our best at it i mean to me i you know i read camus and the particularly in the myth of sisyphus as a as kind of a as a parable that and it's the same lesson that i think he he writes about in the plague where we're all given these insurmountable tasks in our lives but that by doing our duty by being of service to others we can bring meaning to a meaningless chaos and we can bring order to the universe and you know sisyphus was was kind of the iconic hero of the stoics and he was a man because he did because he did something good he delivered a gift to humanity he angered the gods and they condemned him to push a rock up the hill every day and then it would roll down even when he got to the top it would roll down and he'd spend the night going back down the hill to collect it and then rolling it back up the hill again and the task was absurd it was insurmountable he could never win but the last line of that book is one of the great lines which is which is something to the extent that you know i can picture sisyphus smiling because camus' belief was that even though he his task was insurmountable that he was a happy man and he was a happy man because he put his shoulder to the stone he took his duty he embraced the task and the you know and the the absurdity of life and he pushed the stone up the hill and that if we do that and if you know we find ways of being of service to others that is you know the ultimate that's the key to the lock that's the solution to the puzzle each individual person in that way can rebel against absurdity by discovering meaning to this whole messy thing and we can bring meaning not only to our own lives but we can bring meaning to the universe as well we can bring some kind of order to life and you know that those the embrace of those tasks and the and the commitment to service resonates out from us to the rest of humanity in some in some way so you mentioned the plague by camus there's a lot of different ways to read that book but one of them especially given how it was written is that the plague symbolizes nazi germany and the hitler regime what do you learn about human nature from a figure like adolf hitler that he's able to captivate the minds of millions rise to power and take on pulling the whole world into a global war i was born nine years after the end of world war two and i grew up in a generation that was fig you know with my parents who were fixated on that and you know what happened at my father at that time the you know the kind of the the resolution in the minds of most americans and i think people around the world is that there was there had been something wrong with the german people that you know the germans had been particularly susceptible to this kind of demagoguery and to following a powerful leader and and just industrializing cruelty and and and and murder and my father always differed with that my father said this is not a german problem this could happen to all of us we're all just inches away from barbarity and the thing that keeps us safe in this country are the institutions of our democracy our constitution it's not our nature you know our nature has to has to be restrained and it and that comes through self restraint but it also you know the beauty of our country is that we develop we devise these institutions that are designed to allow us to flourish but at the same time not to give give us enough freedom to flourish but also create enough order to keep us from collapsing into barbarity so you know one of the other things that my father talked about from when i was little you know he would ask us this question if you if you were the family and anne frank came to your door and asked you to hide her would you be one of the people who hit her at risk to your own life or would you be one of the people who turned her in and of course we would all say of course we would hide anne frank and take the risk but you know that's been something kind of a lesson a challenge that has been that has always been near the forefront of my mind that if a totalitarian system ever occurs in the united states which my father thought was quite possible like he he was conscious about how fragile democracy actually is that would i be one of the ones who would resist the totalitarianism or would i be one of the people who who went along with it would i be one of the people who who is at the train station in you know krakow or or or you know even berlin and saw people being shipped off to camps and just put my head down and pretend i didn't see it because talking about it would be destructive to my career and maybe my freedom and even my life so you know that has been a challenge that my father gave to me and all of my brothers and sisters and it's something that i've never forgotten a lot of us would like to believe we would resist in that situation but the reality is most of us wouldn't and that's a good thing to think about that human nature is such that we're selfish even when there's an atrocity going on all around us and we also you know we have the capacity to deceive ourselves and all of us tend to kind of judge ourselves by our intentions and our actions what have you learned about life from your father robert f kennedy first of all i'll say this about my uncle because you know i i'm gonna apply that question to my uncle and my father my uncle was asked when he first met jackie bouvier who later became jackie kennedy she was a reporter for a newspaper and she was doing she she had a kind of column where she'd do these these kind of pithy interviews with with both famous people and kind of man in the street interviews and she was interviewing him and she asked him what he she thought what he believed his best quality was is his strongest virtue and she thought that he would say courage because he had been a war hero he had he was the only president who and this is when he was senator by the way who received the purple heart and you know he had a a very kind of famous story of of him as a hero in world war two and then he had come home and he had written a book on car on moral courage among american politicians and won the pulitzer prize that book profiles in courage and which was a series of incidents where american political leaders made decisions to to embrace principle even though their careers were at stake and in most cases were destroyed by their choice she thought he was gonna say courage but he didn't he said curiosity and i think you know looking back at his life that the best that that it was true and that was the quality that allowed him to put himself in the shoes of his adversaries and he always said that if you if the only way that we're gonna have peace is if we're able to put ourselves in the shoes of our adversaries understand their behavior and their contact not contacts and that's why he was able to you know during the he was able to resist the intelligence apparatus in the military during the bay of pigs when they said you've got to send in the essex the aircraft carrier and he said no even though he'd only been a month two months in office he was able to stand up to them because of because he was able to put himself in the shoes of both castro and khrushchev and understand there's gotta be another solution to this and then during the cuban missile crisis he was able to do it when the the the narrative was okay khrushchev acted in a way as an aggressor to put missiles in our hemisphere how dare he do that and jack and my father were able to say well wait a minute he's doing that because we put missiles in turkey and italy that were right on you know and the turkish one's right on the russian border and they then made a secret deal with dobrin and with ambassador dobrin and you know with khrushchev to to remove the missiles in in turkey if he moved the jupiter missiles from to turkey if if so long as khrushchev removed them from from cuba every there were thirteen men on the exec on the end what they call the encon committee which was the group of people who were deciding you know what the action was what what they were gonna do to end the cuban missile crisis and virtually i and of those men eleven of them wanted to invade and wanted to bomb and invade and it was jack and then later on my my father and and bob mcnamara who are the only people who were with him because he was able to see the world from khrushchev's point of view of view he believed that there was another solution and then he also had the moral courage so my father you know to get back to your question famously said that moral courage is the most important quality and it's more it's more rare and courage on a football field or courage in battle than physical courage it's much more difficult to come by but it's the most important quality in a human being and you think that kind of empathy that you referred to that requires moral courage it certainly requires moral courage to to act on it you know and particularly you know in you know anytime that a nation is at war there's kind of a momentum or an inertia that says okay let's not look at this from the other person's point of view and that's the time we really need to do that well if we can apply that style of empathy style of curiosity to the current war in ukraine what is your understanding of why russia invaded ukraine in february twenty twenty two vladimir putin could have avoided the war in the ukraine his invasion was illegal it was unnecessary and it was brutal but i think it's important for us to move beyond these kind of comic book depictions of a you know of this insane avaricious russian leader who wants to you know restore the the soviet empire and that that's why and it was i and it made it an unvoked unprovoked invasion of ukraine he was provoked and we were provoking him and we were provoking him for for since nineteen ninety seven and it's not just me that's saying that i mean when when and i and before russia before putin ever came in we were provoking russia russians in this way unnecessarily and to go back that time in nineteen ninety two when the russians moved out of when the soviet union was collapsing the russians moved out of east germany and they did that which was a huge concession and they had four hundred thousand troops in east germany at that time and they were facing nato troops on the other side of the wall ogorbachev made this huge concession where he said to george bush i'm gonna move all of our troops out and you can then reunify germany under nato which was a hostile army to the to the so it was created to you know with hostile intent toward the soviet union and he said you can take germany but i want your promise that you will not move nato to the east and james baker who was his secretary of state famously said i will not move nato we will not move nato one inch to the east so then five years later in nineteen ninety seven zbigniew brzezinski who was kind of the father of the neocons who was a democrat at that time served in the in the carter administration he said he published a paper a blueprint for moving nato right up to the russian border a thousand miles to the east and and taking over fourteen nations and at that time george kennan who was the kind of the deity of american diplomats he was probably arguably arguably the most important diplomat in american history he was the architect of the containment policy during world war two and he said this is insane and it's unnecessary and if you do this it's gonna provoke the soviet i mean the russians to a violent response and we should be making friends with the russians they lost the cold war we should be treating them the way that we treated the our adversaries after world war two like with a marshall plan to try to help them incorporate into europe and to be part of the the brotherhood of you know of man and of western nations we shouldn't continue to be treating them as an enemy and particularly surrounding them at their borders william perry who was then the secretary of of defense under bill clinton threatened to resign he was so upset by this plan to move nato to the east and william burns who was then the us ambassador to the soviet union who's now at this moment the head of the cia said at that time the same thing if you do this it is going to provoke the russians toward a military response and the the we we we moved it we moved all around russia we moved to fourteen nations a thousand miles to the east and we put aegis missile systems in two nations in romania and poland so we did what you know what the russians had done to us in nineteen sixty two that had provoked would have provoked an invasion of cuba we put those missile systems back there and then we'd walk away unilaterally walk away from the two nuclear missile treaties the intermediate nuclear missile treaties that we had with the soviet with russia and when neither of us would put those missile systems on the borders we walk away from that and we put aegis missile systems which are nuclear capable they can carry the tomahawk missiles which have nuclear warheads so the last country that they didn't take was the ukraine and the russians said and and in fact bill perry said this yeah or or william burns said it this is now the head of the cia it is a red line if we go into if we bring nato into ukraine that is a red line for the russians they cannot live with it they cannot live with it russia has been invaded three times through the ukraine the last time it was invaded we killed or the germans killed one out of every seven russians they destroyed my uncle described what happened to russia in his famous american university speech in in in nineteen sixty three sixty years ago this month or he's or last month sixty years ago in june june tenth nineteen sixty three he told that speech was telling the american people put yourself in the shoes of the russians we need to do that if we're gonna if we're gonna make peace and he said all of us have been taught you know that we won the war but we didn't win the war the russians if anybody won the war against hitler it was the russians their country was destroyed they they all of their city and he said imagine if all of the cities on the east coast of chicago were reduced to rubble and all of the fields burns all of the forest burns that's what happened to russia that's what they gave so that we could get rid of adolf hitler and he had them put themselves in their position and you know today there's none of that happening we have refused repeatedly to to talk to the russians we've broken up there's two treaties the minsk agreements which the russians were willing to sign and they said we will stay out the russians didn't want the ukraine they showed that when they when the donbas region voted ninety to ten to leave and go to russia putin said no we we want ukraine to stay intact but we want you to sign a minsk accords to to you know they the russians were were very worried because of the us involvement in the coup in ukraine in twenty fourteen and then the oppression and the and the you know and the killing of fourteen thousand ethnic russians and russia hasn't had the same re the same way that if mexico put aegis missile systems from china or russia on our border and and killed fourteen thousand expats american we would go in there oh he does have a national security interest in the ukraine he has an interest in protecting the russian speaking people of the ukraine the ethnic russians and the minsk accords did that it it left ukraine as part of russia it left them as a semiautonomous region that could continue to use their own language which is essentially banned by the coup by the government we put in in twenty fourteen and and we wouldn't we we sabotaged that agreement and and in we now know in april of twenty twenty two zelensky and putin had inked a deal already to another peace agreement and that the united states sent boris johnson the neocons in the white house sent boris johnson over to the ukraine to sabotage that agreement so what do i think i think this is a proxy war i think this is a you know this is a war that the neocons in the white house wanted they've said for two decades they wanted this war and that they wanted to use ukraine as a pawn in a proxy war between united states and russia the same as we used afghanistan and they in fact they say it this is the model let's use the afghanistan model that was said again and again and to to to get the russians to overextend their troops and then fight them using local fighters and us weapons and when president biden was asked why are we in the ukraine he was honest he says to depose vladimir putin regime change for vladimir putin and when his defense secretary lloyd austin austin in april twenty twenty two was asked you know why are we there he said to degrade the russians' capacity to fight anywhere to exhaust the russian army and degrade its capacity to fight elsewhere in the world that's not a humanitarian mission that's not what we were told we were we were told this was an unprovoked invasion but and that we're there to bring a humanitarian relief to the ukrainians but that is the opposite that is a war of attrition that is designed to chew up to turn this little nation into an abattoir of death for the flower of ukrainian youth in order to advance a geopolitical ambition of certain people within the white house and you know i think that's wrong we should be talking to the russians the way that you know nixon talked to brezhnev the way that bush talked to gorbachev the way that my uncle talked to khrushchev we need to be talking with the russians we should and and and negotiating and we need to be looking about how do we end this and preserve peace in europe would you as president sit down and have a conversation with vladimir putin and vladimir zelensky separately and together to negotiate peace absolutely what about vladimir putin he's been in power since two thousand so as the old adage goes power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely do you think he has been corrupted by being a power for so long if you think of the man if you look at his mind listen i don't know exactly i can't say because i just i don't know enough about him or about you know i my the evidence that i've seen is that he is homicidal he kills his enemies or poisons them and you know the reaction i've seen to that to hit those accusations from him have have not been to deny that but to kind of laugh it off i think he's a dangerous man and that of course you know there's probably corruption in his regime but having said that it's not our business to change the russian government and anybody who thinks it's a good idea to do regime change in russia which has more nuclear weapons than we do is i think irresponsible and you know vladimir putin himself has said you know we will not live in a world without russia and it was clear when he said that that he was talking about himself and and he has his hand on a button that could bring you know armageddon to the entire planet so why are we messing with this it's not our job to change that regime and and we should be making friends with the russians we shouldn't be treating them as an enemy now we've pushed them into the camp with china that's not a good thing for our country and by the way you know what we're doing now does not appear to be weakening putin at all putin now you know if you believe the the polls that are coming out of russia they show him you know the most recent polls that i've seen show him with an eighty nine percent popularity that people in russia support the war in ukraine and that and they support him as an individual so and i understand there's problems with polling and you know you don't know what to believe but but the polls consistently show that and and i you know it's not america's business to be the policeman of the world and to be changing regimes in the world that's illegal we're not we shouldn't be breaking international laws you know we should actually be looking for ways to improve relationships with russia not to you know not to destroy russia not to destroy not and not to choose its leadership for them that's up to the russian people not us so step one is to sit down and empathize with the leaders of both nations to understand their history their concerns their hopes just to open the door for conversation so they're not back to the corner yeah and i think the us can play a really important role and a us president can play a really important role by re reassuring the russians that we're not gonna consider them an enemy anymore that we wanna be friends and it doesn't mean that you have to let down your guard completely the way that you do it which was the way president kennedy did it is you do it one step at a time you take baby steps we do a unilateral move to reduce our you know our our hostility and aggression and see if the russians reciprocate and and that's the way that we should be doing it and you know we should be easing our way into a positive relationship with russia we have a lot in common with russia and we should be friends with russia and with the russian people and you know apparently there's been three hundred and fifty thousand ukrainians who have died at least in this war and and there's probably been sixty or eighty thousand russians and that should not give us any joy it should not give us any you know i saw lindsey graham on tv saying you know anything we can something to the extent that anything we can do to kill russians is a good use of our money that it is not you know those are those are somebody's children they're you know we should have compassion for them this war is an unnecessary war we should settle it through negotiation through diplomacy through statecraft and not through weapons do you think this war can come to an end purely through military operations no i mean i don't think there's any way in the world that the ukrainians can beat the russians i don't think there's any appetite in europe i think europe is now you know in having severe problems in germany italy france you're seeing these riots there's internal problems in those countries there is no appetite in in in europe for sending men to die in ukraine and the ukrainians do not have anybody left the ukrainians are using press gangs to to you know to fill the ranks of their armies men military age men are trying as hard as they can to get out of the ukraine right now to avoid going to the front the front you know the russians apparently have been killing ukrainians in a seven to one ratio my son fought over there and he told me it's an art you know artillery he had he had firefights with the russians mainly at night but he said most of the battles were artillery wars during the day and the the russians now out outgun the nato forces ten to one in artillery oh they're killing at a horrendous rate now you know my interpretation of what's happened so far is that the putin actually went in early on with a small force because he expected to meet somebody on the other end of a negotiating table that once he went in and and that when that didn't happen they did not have a large enough force to be able to mount an offensive and so they've been building up that force up till now and they now have that force and even against this small original force the ukrainians have been help helpless all of their offenses have died they've now killed you know the head of the ukrainian special forces which was the probably arguably by many accounts the best elite military unit in all of europe the the commandant the commander of of the that special forces group gave a a speech about four months ago saying that eighty six percent of his men are dead or wounded and will cannot return to the front he cannot rebuild that force the and you know the the the troops that are now headed that are now filling the gaps of all those three hundred and fifty thousand men who've been lost are are scantily trained and they're arriving green at the front many of them do not wanna be there many of them are giving up and going over the russian side we've seen this again and again and again including platoon size groups that are defecting to the russians and i don't think it's possible to win and anybody you know i saw i i of course i've studied world war two history exhaustively but i saw a there's a new i think it's a netflix series of documentaries that i highly recommend to people they're it's they're colorized versions of the black and white mhmm films from the battles of world war two but it's all the battles of world war two so i watched stalingrad the other night and you know the the willingness of the russians to to fight on against any kind of allies and to make huge sacrifices of russians the russians themselves who were making the sacrifice with their lives the willingness of them to do that for their motherland is almost inexhaustible it is incomprehensible to think that the that ukraine can can beat russia in a war it would be like mexico beating the united states it it's just it's impossible to think that it can happen and you know russia has has deployed a tiny tiny fraction of its military so far and you know now it has china with its mass production capacity supporting its war effort it's just it's a it's a hopeless situation and we've been lied to you know we're the the press in our country and our government are just are just you know promoting this lie that the ukrainians are about to win and that everything's going great and that putin's on the run and there's all this wishful thinking because of the the wagner group you know the rogozhin rogozhin and the wagner wagner group that this was an internal coup and it showed dissent and weakness of putin and none of that is true i was a that that insurgency which wasn't even an insurgency he only got four thousand of his of his men to follow him out of twenty thousand and they were quickly stopped and nobody in the russian military the oligarchy the political system nobody supported it you know and by we're being told oh yeah it's the beginning of the end for blue putin he's weakened he's wounded he's on his way out and all of these things are just lies that we are being fed so to push back on a small aspect of this that you kind of implied so i've traveled to ukraine and one thing that i should say similar to the battle of stalingrad it is just not it is not only the russians that fight to the end i think ukrainians are very yeah to fight to the end and the morale there is quite high i've talked to nobody this was a year ago in august with herson everybody was proud to fight and die for their country and there's some aspect where this war unified the people to get gave them a reason and an understanding that this is what it means to be ukrainian and i will fight to the death to defend this land i you know i would agree with that and i i i should have said that myself at the beginning you know that's one of the reason my son went over there to fight because the you know he was inspired by the valor of the ukrainian people and the you know this extraordinary willingness of them and i think putin thought it would be much easier to sweep into ukraine and he found you know a stone wall of of ukrainians where they're ready to put their their lives and their bodies on the line but that to me makes the the whole episode even more tragic is that you know i don't believe i i you know i i think that the us role in this has been has you know that there there were there were many opportunities to settle this war and the ukrainians wanted settled vladimir zelenskyy when he ran in twenty nineteen here's a guy who's a a comedian he's a he's an actor he had no political experience and yet he won this election with seventy percent of the vote why he won on a peace platform anyone promising to sign the minsk accords and yet something happened when he got in there that made him suddenly pivot and you know i think it's a good guess what happened i think he was you know he came under threat by ultra natural within his own administration and the insistence of neocons like victoria nuland in the white house that you know we don't want peace with putin we want a war do you worry about nuclear war yeah i worry about it it's it seems like a silly question but it's not it's a serious question well the reason it's not you know the reason it it might it's not is just because people seem to be in this kind of dream state about that it'll never happen and yet you know we're it it can happen very easily and it can happen at any time and you know if we push the russians too far you know i i don't doubt that putin if he felt like his regime was in or his nation was in danger that the united states was gonna be able to place you know a a quisling on you know in into the kremlin that he would use nuclear you know torpedoes and you know these these strategic weapons that they have and that could be the be it once you do that nobody controls the trajectory by the way you know i have i have very strong memories of the cuban missile crisis and of those thirteen days when we came closer to nuclear war you know and particularly i think it was when the u two got shot down over cuba that you know and nobody in this there's a lot of people in washington dc who at that point thought that they very may well may wake up dead that the world may end at night thirty million americans killed a hundred and thirty million russians this is what our military brass wanted they saw a war with russia nuclear exchange with russia as not only inevitable but also desirable because they wanted to do it now while we still had a superiority can you actually go through the feelings you've had about the cuban missile crisis like what what are your memories of it what's what are some interesting kinda you know in the middle of i i was going to school in washington dc to to sit well or to our lady of victory which is in washington dc so we were i lived in virginia across the stomach and we would cross the bridge every day into dc and during the crisis us marshals came to my house to take us i think around day eight my father was spending the night at the white house he wasn't coming home he was staying with the ex comm committee and sleeping there and they were up you know twenty four hours a day they were debating and fig trying to figure out what was happening and but we had us marshals come to our house to take us down they were gonna take us down to white sulphur springs in in southern virginia in the in the blue ridge mountains where there was a there was an underground city essentially a bunker that was like a city and apparently it had mcdonald's in it and a lot of other you know it had it was a full city for the us government and their families us marshals came to our house to take us down there and i was very excited about doing that and this was at a time you know when we were doing the drills we were doing the duck and cover drills once a week at our school where they would tell you if they that you know when the alarms go off then you you put your head onto the table you take the remove the sharps from your desk put them inside your desk you put your head onto the table and you wait and the initial blast will take the windows out of the school and then we all stand up and and file in an orderly fashion into the basement where we're gonna be for the next six or eight months or whatever but in the basement where you know we we went occasionally and those corridors were lined with freeze dried food canisters up to the from floor to ceiling so people were you know we were all preparing for this and it was you know bob mcnamara who was my who was a friend of mine and you know was my father one of my father's close friend defense he later called it mass psychosis and my father deeply regretted participating in the bomb shelter program because he said it was part of a a you know a psychological psyop trick to treat them to teach americans that nuclear war was acceptable that it was survivable and my father anyway when they when the marshals came to our house take me and my brother joe away and we we were the ones who were home at that time my father called and he talked to us on the phone and he said i don't want you going down there because because if you disappear from school people are gonna panic and i need you to be a good soldier and go to school in that way and and he said something to me during that period which was that if a nuclear war happened it would be better to be among the dead than the living which i did not believe okay i mean i i had already prepared myself for the you know for the for the dystopian future and i knew i could i spent every day in the woods i knew that i could survive by catching crawfish and you know cooking mud puppies and do whatever i had to do but i felt like okay i can i can handle this and i really wanted to see the setup down in you know this underground city but anyway that was you know part of it for me my father was away and you know the last days of it my father got this idea because khrushchev had sent two letters he sent one letter that was conciliatory and then he sent a letter that after his joint chiefs and the warmongers around him to solve that letter and they disapproved of it they sent another letter that was extremely belligerent and my father had the idea let's just pretend we didn't get the second letter and reply to the first one and then he went down to dobrinen and who was he met dobrynin in the justice department and dobrynin was the soviet ambassador and they you know they proposed this settlement which was a secret settlement where khrushchev would withdraw the missiles from cuba khrushchev had put the missiles in cuba because we had put missiles you know nuclear missiles in in turkey and italy and my uncle's secret deal was that if he if khrushchev removed the missiles from cuba within six months he would get rid of the jupiter missiles in turkey but if khrushchev told anybody about the deal it was off mhmm so if if news got out about that secret deal it was off because that was the actual deal and khrushchev complied with it and then my uncle complied with it how much of that part of human history turned on the decisions of one person i think that's one of the you know because that of course the perennial question right what is history kind of on a on a on automatic pilot and you know human decisions decisions of leaders really only have you know marginal or incremental bearing on what is gonna happen anyway but i think that is the and historians argue about that all the time i think that that is a really good example of a play of a a place in human history that that literally the world could have ended if we had a different leader in the white house and the reason for that is that there were as i recall sixty four gun emplacements you know missile missile emplacements each one of those missile emplacements had a crew of about a hundred men and they were soviets so they were and they we didn't know whether we we had a couple of questions that my uncle asked allen dull or asked the cia and he asked dulles was already gone but he asked the cia and he asked his military brass because they all wanted to go in everybody wanted to go in and my uncle said my uncle asked to see the aerial photos he and he examined those personally and that's why it's important to have a leader in the white house who can push back on on their bureaucracies he and then he asked them you know are those who's manning those missile sites who and are they russians and if they're russians and we bomb them are they isn't it gonna force khrushchev to then go into berlin and that would be the beginning of a cascade effect that would you know highly likely to end a nuclear confrontation and the the the military brass said to my uncle oh we don't think you'll have the you know we don't think you'll have the the guts to do that mhmm so he went my uncle was like that's what you're betting on and you know they all wanted him to go in they wanted him to bomb the sites and then invade cuba mhmm and he said if we bomb those sites we're gonna be killing russians and it's gonna force it's gonna provoke russia into some response and the obvious response is for them to go into berlin oh the but the thing that we didn't know then we didn't find out until i think you know there was a it was like a thirty year anniversary of the cuban missile crisis in havana and what we learned then was that from the russians who came to that event it was like a symposium where everybody on both sides talked about it and we learned a lot of stuff that and never nobody knew before one of the insane things the most insane thing that we learned was that the the weapons were already the the nuclear warheads were already in place they were ready to fire and that the authorization to fire was made was delegated to each of the gun grub gun crew commanders so there were sixty people who had all had authorization to fire if they felt themselves under attack so you have to believe that at least one of them would have launched and that would have been the beginning of the end and you know if they if anybody had launched you know we knew what would happen my uncle knew what would happen because he asked again and again what's gonna happen and they said thirty million americans will be killed but we will kill a hundred and thirty million russians so we will win and that was a victory for them and my uncle said later said he told he told arthur schlesinger and kenny o'donnell he said those guys he called them the salad brass the guys with all of this stuff on their chest and he said he said those guys they don't care because they know that if it happens that they're gonna be in the charge of everything they're the ones who are gonna be running the world after that mhmm so for them you know it was it was an incentive to to kill a hundred and thirty million russians and thirty million americans but my uncle he had this correspondence with khrushchev they were secretly corresponding with each other and that is what saved the world is that they had that both of them had been men of war you know eisenhower famously said it will it will not be a man of war it will not be a soldier who starts world war three because a guy who's actually seen it knows how bad it is and my uncle you know had been in the heat of of the south pacific his boat had been cut in two by a japanese destroyer his many of his three of his crewmen had been killed one of them badly burned he he pulled that guy with a lanyard in his teeth six miles to an island in the middle of the night and then they hid out there for ten days you know and and you know he came back like i said he was the only president of the united states that earned the purple heart meanwhile khrushchev had been at stalingrad which was the worst place to be on the planet you know probably in the twentieth century other than you know in auschwitz or one of the death camps it was you know it was it was the most ferocious horrific war with people starving people you know committing cannibalism you know eating the dogs the cats eating their shoe leather freezing to death by the thousands etcetera khrushchev did not want the last thing he wanted was a war and the last thing my uncle wanted was a war and they but the the cia did not know anything about khrushchev and the reason for that is the there was a mole at langley so that every time the cia got a spy in the kremlin he would immediately be killed so they had no eyes in the kremlin you know there were literally hundreds of russia of russian spies who had who were who had defected the united states and were in the kremlin who were killed during that period they had no idea anything about khrushchev about how he saw the world and they saw the kremlin itself as a monolith you know that is is kind of you know the same way that we look at putin today that you know it's all they they have this ambition of world conquest and that's it's driving them and there's nothing else they think about they're absolutely single-minded about it but actually there was a big division between khrushchev and and his joint chiefs and his intelligence apparatus and they and they both at one point discovered they were both in the same situation they were surrounded by spies and military personnel who were intent on going to war and they were the two guys resisting it so when my uncle my uncle had this idea of you know being the peace president from the beginning he told ben bradley his one of his best friends who you know was run the publisher of the washington post for the editor in chief at that time he said ben riley asked him what is what do you want in your gravestone and my uncle said he kept the peace he said the principal job of the president of the united states is to keep the country out of war and and so when he first became president he he anxiously agreed to meet khrushchev in geneva to do a summit and by the way eisenhower wanted to do the same thing eisenhower wanted peace his and he was gonna meet in vienna but that peace summit was blown up he was gonna try to do you know he was gonna try to end the cold war eisenhower was in the last year of his of his in may of nineteen sixty but that was torpedoed by the cia during the u two crash you know they sent a u two over the over the soviet union and it got shot down and then they told and then alan dulles told eisenhower to deny that we had a program they didn't know that the russians had captured gary francis powers and so when and and that blew up the peace talks between eisenhower and khrushchev and so you know they and they're they're he there was a lot of tension my uncle wanted to break that tension he agreed to meet with with khrushchev in vienna early on in his term he went over there and khrushchev snubbed him khrushchev lectured him imperiously about the you know the the terror of american imperialism and and rebuffed any you know they did agree not to go into laos they made an agreement that kept the united states to keep my uncle from sending troops to laos but it it had been a a disaster vienna so then we had a spy that used to come to our house all the time a guy called georgi bolshagoi he was this russian spy my my parents had met at the embassy they had gone to a party or a reception at the russian embassy and he had approached them and they knew he was a he was a gru agent and kgb he was both oh he used to come to our house they really liked him he was very attractive he was always laughing and joking he would do rope climbing contests with my father he would do push up contests with my father he was he could do the russian dancing the cossack dancing and he would do that for us and teach us that and he would and we knew he was a spy too and this was at the time of you know the james bond films were first coming out so it was really exciting for us to have a actual russian spy in our house the state department was horrified by it but but anyway when khrushchev after vienna and after the you know the bay pigs khrushchev had second thoughts and he sent this long letter to my uncle and he didn't wanna go through his his state department or his embassy he wanted to en route them but and he was friends with so he gave georgie the the letter and georgie brought it and handed it to pierre salinger folded in the new york times and he gave it to my uncle and it was this beautiful letter which he said you know he my uncle had talked to him about the children who were played you know we played twenty nine grandchildren who were playing in his yard and he's saying what is our moral basis for making a decision that could kill these children so they'll never write a poem they'll never participate in election they'll never run for office how can we make how can we can we morally make a decision that is going to eliminate life for these beautiful kids and he had said that to to khrushchev and khrushchev wrote them this letter back saying that he was now sitting as this dacha on the black sea and that he was thinking about what my uncle jack had said to him at vienna and he regretted very deeply not having taken the olive leaf that jack had offered him and then he said you know it occurs to me now that we're all on an arc and that there is not another one and that the entire fate of the planet and all of its creatures and all of the children are dependent on the decisions we make and you and i have a moral obligation to go forward with each other as friends and immediately after that this was you know they he said that right after the berlin crisis in nineteen sixty two general curtis lemay tried to had tried to provoke a war with a an incident at checkpoint charlie which was the the the entrance the entrance and exit through the berlin wall in berlin and the russian tanks has come to the wall the us tanks had come to the wall and there was a standoff and my uncle had had sent a message to khrushchev then through dobrin and saying my back is at the wall i cannot i have no place to back to please back off and then we will back off and khrushchev took his word packed his tanks off first and then my uncle ordered lemay to back back he had lemay had mounted bulldozer plows on the on the front of the tanks to to plow down the berlin wall mhmm and that and the russians had come so it was just you know it was the it was the his generals trying to provoke a war and but they started talking to each other and and then when he after he wrote that letter they agreed that they would install a hotline so they could talk to each other and they wouldn't have to go through intermediaries mhmm and so at at jack's house on the cape there was a red phone that we knew if we picked it up kruschev would answer mhmm and there was another one in the white house yeah and but they knew it was important to talk to each other you know and you just wish that we had that kind of leadership today that can you know that that just understands our job look i know you know a lot about ai right and you know how dangerous it is potentially to humanity and what opportunities it also you know offers but it could kill us all i mean elon said first it's gonna steal our job then it's gonna kill us right yeah and it's it's probably not hyperbole it actually biological evolution which are just the laws of mathematics that's probably a good endpoint for it you know a a potential endpoint so we we need it's gonna happen but we need to make sure it's regulated and it's regulated properly for safety in every country and and that includes russia and china and iran right now we we should be putting all the weapons of war aside and sitting down with those guys and say how are we doing how are we gonna do this there's much more important things to do we're gonna this stuff is gonna kill us if we don't figure out how to regulate it and and leadership needs to look down the road at what what is the real risk here and the real risk is that you know ai will will you know enslave us for one thing and you know and and then destroy us and do all this other stuff and how about biological weapons we're now all working on these biological weapons and we're doing biological weapons from for ebola and and you know dengue fever and you know all of these other bad things and we're making ethnic bioweapons bioweapons that can only kill russians bioweapons that the chinese are making that you know are are can kill people who don't who don't have chinese genes so all of this is now within reach we're actively doing it and we need to stop it and we can easily a a biological weapons treaty is the easiest thing in the world to do we can verify it we can enforce it and everybody wants to agree to it it only insane people do not wanna wanna continue this kind of research there's no reason to do it so there are these existential threats to all of humanity now out there like ai and biological biological weapons we need to start stop fighting each other start competing on economic game fields playing fields instead of military playing fields which will be good for all of humanity and that we need to sit down with each other and negotiate reasonable treaties on how we regulate ai and and biological weapons and nobody's talking about this in this political race right now nobody's talking about it in the government they get fixated on these little wars and you know and these comic book depictions of good versus evil and you know and we all go you know hoorah and and go off to and give them the weapons and enrich you know the military and gosh i should have complex but we're we're on the road to perdition if we don't end this and some of this requires to have this kind of phone that connects khrushchev and john f kennedy that cuts through all the bureaucracy yeah to have this communication between heads of state and in the in the case of ai perhaps heads of tech companies where you can just pick up the phone and have a conversation because a lot of it a lot of the existential threats of artificial intelligence perhaps even bioweapons is unintentional it's not even strategic intentional effects so you have to be transparent and honest about especially with ai that people might not know what what's the worst that's going to happen once you release it out into the wild and you have to have an honest kind of communication about how to do it so that companies are not terrified of regulation overreach of regulation and then government is not terrified of tech companies of manipulating them in some direct or indirect ways so like there's a trust that builds versus a distrust that that seems to so basically that old phone where khrushchev can call john f kennedy is needed yeah and you know i don't think there's listen i don't understand ai okay i do know i i can see from all this technology how it's this kind of turnkey totalitarianism that once you put these systems in place you know they can be misused to enslave people and they can be misused in wars and you know to subjugate to kill to do all of these bad things and i don't think there's anybody on capitol hill who understands this you know we need to bring in the tech community and say tell us what these regulations need to look like mhmm you know so that there can be freedom to innovate so that we can milk ai for all of the good things but not you know fall into these traps that are gonna you know that that are these existential threats to that pose existential threats to humanity it seems like john f kennedy is a singular figure in that he was able to have the humility to reach out to khrushchev and also the the strength and integrity to resist the what did you call them the the salad salad brass and institutions like the cia so that that makes it particularly tragic that he was killed to what degree was cia involved or the various bureaucracy involved in his death the evidence that the cia was involved in my uncle's murder and that they con that they were subsequently involved in the cover up and and continue to be involved in the cover up i mean there's still five thousand documents that they won't release you know sixty years later is i think so insurmountable and so you know mountainous and overwhelming that i it's beyond any reasonable doubt including you know dozens of confessions of people who were involved in the in the in the assassination but you know all of every kind of document and and you know i mean it came as a surprise recently to most americans i think the release of these documents in which the the press the american media finally acknowledged that yeah lee harvey oswald was the cia asset and he was recruited you know in nineteen fifty seven he was a marine working at the atatouille air force base and which was the cia air force base in you know with the u two flights which was a cia program and that he was recruited by james jesus angleton who was the director of counterintelligence and then sent on a fake defection to russia and then brought back you know to to to dallas and people didn't know that even though it's been known for decades but the the never percolated into the mainstream media because they have such a you know they're they have such a an allergy to anything that that that challenges the warren report and when congress investigated my uncle's murder in the in the in the nineteen seventies the church committee did and they did you know two and a half year investigation and they had many many more documents and much more testimony available to them than the warren commission had and this was this was a decade after the warren commission they came to the conclusion that my uncle was killed by a conspiracy and there was a division where essentially one guy on that committee believed it was primarily the mafia but richard schweitzer the senator head of the committee said you know straight out the cia was involved in the murder of the president of the united states oh and and the if i've talked to most of the staff on that committee and they said yeah and the cia was stonewalling us the whole way through and the actual people that the cia appointed george jochenny's who had who the cia appointed as a liaison to the committee they brought him out of retirement he had been one of the masterminds of the assassination oh there's no i mean i it's impossible to even talk about a tiny fraction of the evidence here what i suggest to people there are hundreds of books written about this that you know assemble this evidence and mobilize the evidence the best book to me for people to read is james douglas's book which is called the unspeakable and he douglas does this extraordinary he's an extraordinary scholar and he does this amazing job of digesting and summarizing and mobilizing all of the you know the probably a million documents and you know the evidence from all these confessions that have come out into a coherent story and it's riveting to read and you know i recommend people who do not take my word for it you know and don't take don't take anybody else's word for it go ahead and do the research yourself and one way to do that is probably the most efficient way is to read douglas' book because he has all the references there so if it's true that cia had a hand in this assassination how is it possible for them to amass so much power how is it possible for them to become corrupt and is it individuals or is it the entire institution no it's not the entire institution my daughter-in-law who's run helping to run my campaign was a cia you know in the clandestine services for all her career she was a spy in the weapons of mass destruction program in the middle east and in china and there's twenty two thousand people who work for the cia probably twenty thousand of those are you know are patriotic americans and really good public servants and they're doing important work for our country but the institution is corrupt and and because the higher ranks of the institution and in fact mike pompeo said something like this to me the other day he was the director of the cia he said when i was there i did not go do a good job of cleaning up that agency and he said the entire upper bureaucracy of that agency are people who do not believe in institutions of of democracy this is what he said to me so i don't know if that's true but i know that you know that's significant he's a smart person and he ran the agency and he was the secretary of state but it's no mystery how that happened we know the history the cia was originally first of all there was great reluctance in nineteen forty seven that we had for the first time we had a secret spy agency in this country during world war two called the oss that was disbanded after the war because congress said having a secret spy agency is incompatible with a democracy secret spy agencies are things that like the kgb the stasi in east germany slovakia iran and pip in chile whatever you know all over the world they're all have to do with totalitarian governments they're not something that you can have that it's it's antithetical to democracy to have that but in ninety four seven we created truman signed it in but it was initially an espionage agency which means information gathering which is important it's to get to to gather and consolidate information from many many different sources from all over the world and and put those in reports of the white house so the president can make good decisions based upon valid information evidence based you know decision making but alan dulles who was the you know the essentially the first head of the agency made a series of of legislative imaginations and political imaginations that gave additional powers to the agency and opened up the what they called then the the plans division which is the plans division is the dirty tricks it's the black ops fixing elections murdering what they call executive action which means killing foreign leaders and you know making small wars and and bribing and blackmailing people stealing elections and that kind of thing and the reason at that time you know we were in the middle of the cold war and truman and then eisenhower did not wanna go to war they didn't wanna commit troops and it seemed to them that you know this was a way of kind of fighting the cold war secretly without and doing it at minimal cost by by changing events sort of invisibly and so it was seductive to them but everybody you know congress when they first voted it in place congress both political parties said if we create this thing it could turn into a monster and it could undermine our you know our values and today they it's so it's so powerful and then nobody knows what its budget is plus it has its own investment fund in q tel which has invested you know made i think two thousand investments in silicon valley so it has ownership of a lot of these tech companies that you know and the a lot of the ceos of those tech companies have signed state secrecy agreements with the cia which if they even reveal that they have signed that they can go to jail for twenty years and have their assets removed etcetera the influence that the agency has the capacity to influence events at every level in our country are is really frightening and then for most of its for most of its life the cia was banned from propagandizing americans but we learned that they were doing it anyway so in nineteen seventy three during the church committee hearings we learned that the cia had a program called operation mockingbird mhmm where they had at least four hundred members leading members of the united states press corps and the new york times the washington post abc cbs nbc etcetera who were secretly working for the agency and and steering news coverage to support cia priorities and they agreed at that time to disband operation mockingbird in seventy three but there's there's indications they didn't do that and they still the cia today is the biggest funder of journalism around the world moe the the biggest funder is through usaid the usa the united states funds journalism in almost every country in the world you know it owns newspapers it has journalists on it thousands and thousands of journalists on its pay payroll they're not supposed to be doing that in the united states but you know in twenty sixteen president obama changed the law to make it legal now for the cia to propagandize americans and i think you know we can't look at the ukraine war and how that was you know has been how the narrative has been formed in the in the minds of americans and say that the cia had nothing to do with that what is the mechanism by which the say influences the narrative do you think it's indirectly through through the press indirectly through the press or directly by funding the press directly through key member i mean there are certain press organs that have been linked you know to the agency that the people who run those organs things like the daily beast now rolling stone you know editor of rolling stone noah schlechtman has deep relationships with the intelligence community salon daily kos but i wonder why they would do it so from my perspective it just seems like the job of a journalist is to have an integrity where your opinion cannot be influenced or bought i agree with you but i actually think that the entire field of journalism has has you know really ashamed itself in recent years because it it's become you know the the principal newspapers in this country and the television station the the legacy media have abandoned their their traditional their tradition of of you know which was when i was a kid listen my house was filled with the greatest journalists alive at that time people like ben bradley like anthony lewis mary mcgrory pete hamill jerry jack neufeld jimmy breslin and many many others and after my father after my father died they started the rfk journalism awards to recognize integrity and courage you know journalistic integrity and color courage and for that generation of journalism they they thought they believed that the that the function of journalists was to maintain this posture of fierce skepticism toward any aggregation of power and including government authority you always the people in authority lie and that way they always have to be questioned and and that their job was to speak truth to power and to be guardians of the first amendment right to to free expression but if you look what happened during the pandemic it was the inverse of that kind of journalism where the the major press organs in this country were instead of speaking truth to power they were doing the opposite they were broadcasting propaganda they became propaganda organs for the government agencies and they were actually censoring the speech of dissent anybody who dissents of the powerless oh and in in fact it was it was an organized conspiracy you know and it was the name of it was the trusted news initiative and you know some of the major press organs in our country signed on to it and they agreed not to print stories or facts that that departed from government orthodoxy so the washington post was the signature of the upi the ap and then the the four media or the four social media groups microsoft twitter facebook and google all signed on to the trusted news initiative it was started by the bbc organized by them and the purpose of it was to make sure nobody could print anything about government that departed from government or orthodox and the way it worked is the upi and the ap and the which are the news services that provide most of the news you know news around the country and the washington post would decide what news was permissible to print and a lot of it was about covid but also on our biden's laptops were you it was impermissible to suggest that those were real or that you know they had stuff on there that was compromising and and we you know and by the way i this what i'm telling you now is all well documented and i'm litigating on it right now so i'm part of a lawsuit against the dni and so i know a lot about what happened and i have all this documented and people can go to our website there's a letter on my substack now to to michael sher of the washington post that outlines all this and gives all my sources because michael sher accused me of being a conspiracy theorist when he was actually part of a conspiracy a true conspiracy to suppress anybody who was departing from government orthodoxies by either censoring them completely or labeling them conspiracy theorists i i mean you can understand the intention and the action the difference between this we talked about you can understand the intention of such a thing being good at a time of a a catastrophe in a time of a pandemic there's a lot of risk to saying untrue things but that's a slippery slope that leads into yeah a place where the journalistic integrity that we talked about is completely sacrificed and then you could deviate from truth if you read their internal memorandum including the statements of the the the leader of the trusted news initiative i think her name's jessica jennifer cecil and i you know you can go on our website and see her say amen and she she says the purpose of this is that we're now she says when people look at us they think we're competitors but we're not the real competitors are coming from all these alternative news sources now all over the network and they're hurting public trust in us and they're hurting our economic model and we have to they have to be choked off and crushed and and the way that we're gonna do that is to make an agreement with the social media sites that if we say if we label their information misinformation the social media sites will will deplatform it or they will throttle it or they will shadowban it which destroys the economic model of those alternative competitive sources of information so that that's true but and but the point you make is an important point that the journalists themselves who probably didn't know about the tni agreement certainly i'm sure they didn't they believe that they're doing the right thing by suppressing information that may challenge you know government proclamations on covid but i mean there's a a danger to that and the danger is that you know once you appoint yourself an arbiter of what's true and what's not true then there's really no end to the power that you have now assumed for yourself because now you your your job is no longer to inform the public your job now is to manipulate the public and if you end up manipulating the public in collusion with powerful entities then you become the instrument of authoritarian rule rather than the you know the the opponent of it and it becomes the inverse of journalism and a democracy you're running for president as a democrat what to you are the strongest values that represent the left wing politics of this country i would say protection of the environment and the the commons you know the air the water wildlife fisheries public lands the you know the those assets they cannot be reduced to private property ownership mhmm you know the you know the landscapes are purple mountain majesty the protection of the most vulnerable people in our society people who which would include children and minorities the the restoration of the middle class you know the and and protection of labor dignity and you know decent pay for labor bodily autonomy a woman's right to choose or an individual's right to endure unwanted medical procedures peace you know the democrats have always been anti war that refusal to use fear is a governing tool mhmm fdr said the the only thing we have to fear is fear itself because he recognized that tyrants and dictators could use fear to disable critical thinking and and and overwhelm the the desire for personal liberty the the the freedom of government from untoward influenced by corrupt corporate power it's the the end of this corrupt merger of of the state and corporate power that is now i think dominating our democracy it's what eisenhower warned about when he warned against the emergence of the military industrial complex and then i prefer to talk about the kind of the positive vision of what we should be doing in our country and globally which is you know i i i see that the corporations are commoditizing us are poisoning our children are strip mining the wealth from our middle class and and treating america as if it were business liquidation converting assets to cash as quickly as possible and you know and and creating or exacerbating this this huge disparity in wealth in our country which is eliminating the middle class and creating you know kind of a latin american style feudal model there's a these huge aggregations of wealth above and widespread poverty below and that's a configuration that is too unstable to support democracy sustainably you know and we're supposed to be modeling democracy but we're losing it and i you know i think we have ought to have a foreign policy that restores our moral authority around the world restore restores america as the embodiment of moral authority in which it was when my uncle was president and as a purveyor of peace rather than you know war like nation my uncle said he didn't want people in africa and latin america and asia to think of when they think of america to picture a man with a gun and a bayonet he wanted them to think of a peace corps volunteer and he refused to send combat veterans abroad combat soldiers abroad he never sent a single soldier to his death abroad and in the you know into combat he sent sixteen thousand he resisted in in berlin in sixty two he resisted in laos in sixty one he resisted in in vietnam you know vietnam they wanted him to put two hundred and fifty thousand troops he only put sixteen thousand advisers which was fewer pew fewer troops and he sent to get james meredith into the into the universe to ole miss in oxford mississippi one black man he sent sixteen thousand and and a month before he died he ordered them all home he actually i think it was october second of nineteen sixty three he heard that a green beret had died and he asked his aide for a combat for a list of combat fatalities and the aide came back and there was seventy five men had died in vietnam at that point and he said that's too many we're gonna have no more and he ordered he signed a national security order two sixty three and ordered all of those men all americans home from vietnam by nineteen sixty five with the first thousand coming home by december sixty three and then in november he of course just before that evacuation began he was killed and a week later president johnson remanded that order and then a year after that the tonkin gulf resolution we sent two hundred and fifty thousand which is what they wanted my uncle to do which he refused and then and it became an american war and then nixon you know topped it off at five hundred and sixty thousand fifty six thousand americans never came home including my cousin george skakel who died at the tet offensive and we killed a million vietnamese and we got nothing for it so america should be the symbol of peace and you know today my my uncle you know really focused on putting america on the side of the poor yeah instead of our tradition of you know of of of fortifying oligarchies that weren't anti communism that was our you know our major criteria if you said you were against communists and of course the people were were the rich people our aid was going to the rich people in those countries and they were going to the military hunt us our weapons were going to the hunt us to fight against the poor and my uncle said no you know america should be on the side of the poor and so he launched the alliance for progress and usaid which were intended to bring aid to the poorest people in those and build middle classes and and take ourselves away in fact his most his favorite trip he his two favorite trips while he was president his most favorite trip was to ireland this is incredible emotional homecoming for all of the people of ireland but his second favorite trip was when he went to colombia he went to latin america but colombia was his favorite country and there were i think there were two million people came into bogota to see this vast crowd and they were just delirious cheering for him and the president of colombia geras carmelo said to him do you know why they love you and my uncle said why and he said because they think you've put america on the side of the poor against the oligarchs and you know when my uncle after he died today there are more avenues and boulevards and hospitals and schools named after and statues named after and commemorating in parks commemorating john kennedy in africa and latin america than any other president in the united states and probably more than all the other presidents combined and it's because you know he put america on the side of the poor and that's what we ought to be doing we ought to be projecting mill economic power abroad the chinese have essentially stolen his playbook and you know we've spent eight trillion dollars on the iraq war and its aftermath the wars in syria yemen libya you know afghanistan pakistan and what do we get for that we got nothing for that money eight trillion dollars we got we killed more iraqis than saddam hussein iraq today is is a is a mad worse much worse off than it was when saddam was there it's a it's an incoherent violent war between shia and sunni death squads we pushed iraq into the embrace of iran which now become essentially a proxy of a for iran which is exactly the outcome that we were trying to prevent for the past you know twenty or thirty years we created isis we sent two million refugees into europe destabilizing all of the nations in europe for generations we're now seeing these riots in in france and that's a direct result from the syrian war that we created and and our creation of isis brexit is another you know result of that so we for for eight trillion dollars we wrecked the world and during that same period that we spent eight point one trillion dollars it's bombing bridges ports schools hospitals etcetera the chinese spent eight point one trillion dollars building schools ports hospitals bridges and and and universities and now you know the chinese are are out competing us everywhere in the world everybody wants to deal with the chinese because they you know they come in they they build nice things for you and they and there's no strings attached and they're pleasant to deal with and and you know as a result of that brazil is switching the chinese currency argentina is switching saudi arabia our greatest partner that you know we put trillions of dollars into protecting our oil pipelines there and now they they're saying you know we we don't we don't care what the united states think that's what mohammed bin salam said he said we don't he you know they he dropped oil production in saudi arabia in the middle of a us inflation spiral they've never done that to us before to aggravate the inflation spiral and two weeks later and then they signed a deal a a a unilateral peace deal with iran which has been the enemy that we've been telling them to you know to be a bulwark against for twenty years and two weeks after that he said we don't care what the united states thinks anymore so that's what we got for spending all those trillions of dollars there we got short term friends and the united states you know policy abroad and we have not made ourselves safer we've made americans we've put americans in more jeopardy all over the world you know you have to wait in lines to get through the airport you have to you know the security state is now then costing us one point three trillion dollars and america is unsafer and poorer than it's ever been so you know we're we're not getting we should be doing what president kennedy said we ought to do and what what china the policy that china has now adopted so that's a really eloquent and clear and powerful description of the way you see us should be doing geopolitics and the way you see us should be taking care of the poor in this country let me ask you this a question from jordan peterson that he asked when i told him that i'm speaking with you given everything you've said when does the left go too far i suppose he's referring to cultural issues identity politics well you know jordan tried to get me to bad mouth the laugh the whole time i was in i i really enjoyed my my my talk with him yeah but he seemed to have that agenda where he wanted me to you know say bad things about the left i just you know that's not what my campaign is about i wanna do the opposite i'm not gonna bad mouth the left they try i you know i was on a show this week with david remnick from the new yorker and he tried to get me to bad mouth donald trump and you know and alex jones and a lot of other people just and and baiting me to do it and of course there's a lot of bad things i could say about all those people but it doesn't you know i'm trying to find i'm trying to find values that hold us together that we can share in common rather than to focus constantly on these disputes and these issues that drive us apart so me sitting here bad mouthing the left or bad mouthing the right is not gonna advance the ball i i really wanna figure out ways that you know what do these groups hold in common that we can all you know have a shared vision of what we want this country to look like well that's music to my ears but in that spirit let me ask you a difficult question then you wrote a book harshly criticizing anthony fauci let me ask you the steel man the case for the people who support him what is the biggest positive thing you think anthony fauci did for the world what is good that he has done for the world especially during this pandemic you know i don't want to sit here and speak unchartedly by saying the guy didn't do anything but i i don't i can't think of anything i mean if you if you tell me something that you think he did you know maybe there was a drug that got licensed while he was at nih that you know benefited people that's certainly possible he was there for fifty years and i i in terms of his of his principal programs of the aids programs and his covid programs and i think that the harm that he did vastly outweighed the you know the the benefits do you think he believes he's doing good for the world i don't know what he believes in fact in that book which is i think two hundred and fifty thousand words i never try to look inside of his head i i deal with facts i deal with science oh and every every factual assertion in that book is cited and sourced to government databases or peer reviewed publications and i don't i try not to speculate about things that i don't know about or i can't prove and i do i cannot tell you what his motivations were or i mean all of us he's done a thing a lot of things that i think are really very very bad things for humanity are very deceptive but we all have this this capacity for self deception as i said at the beginning of this podcast we we judge ourselves on our intentions rather than our actions and we all have an almost infinite capacity to convince ourselves that what we're doing is is right and you know not everybody kind of lives an examined life and is is examining their motivations in the way that the world might experience their professions of goodness let me ask about the difficulty of the job he had do you think it's possible to do that kind of job well or is it also a fundamental flaw of the job of being the central centralized figure that's supposed to have scientific policy no i think he was a genuinely bad human being and that there were many many good people in that department over the years bernice eddy is a really good example john anthony morris many people whose careers he destroyed because they were trying to tell the truth one after the other the greatest scientists in the history of nih were run out of that organization out of that agency but you know i people listening to this i you know probably you know will in hearing me say that will think that i'm bitter or that i i'm doctrinaire about him but you know you should really go and read my book and i it's hard to summarize a you know i tried to be really methodical to not call names to to just say what happened you are the bigger picture of this is you're an outspoken critic of pharmaceutical companies big pharma what is the biggest problem with big pharma and how can it be fixed well the problem could be fixed through regulation you know the problems but the pharmaceutical industry is is i mean i don't wanna say because this is gonna seem extreme that a criminal enterprise but if you look at the history that is an applicable descript or characterization for example the the four biggest vaccine makers sanofi merck pfizer and glaxo four companies that make all of the seventy two vaccines that are now mandated for america effectively mandated for american children collectively those companies have paid thirty five five billion dollars in criminal penalties and damages in the last decade and i think since two thousand about seventy nine billion so these are the most corrupt companies in the world and the problem is that they're serial felons they you know they do this again and again and again so they did vi you know merck did vioxx which vioxx they you know they killed people by falsifying science and they did it they lied to the public they said this is a headache medicine and a and a arthritis painkiller but they didn't tell people that it also gave you heart attacks and they knew you know we've found when we sued them the you know the memos from their bean counters saying we're gonna kill this many people but we're still going to make money so they make those calculations and those calculations are made very very regularly and then you know when they when they get caught they they pay a penalty and i think they paid about seven billion dollars for vioxx but then they went right back that same year that they paid that penalty they went back into the same thing again with gardasil and with a whole lot of other drugs so the way that the system is set up the way that it's sold to doctors the way that nobody ever goes to jail so there's really no penalty that it all becomes part of the cost of doing business and you know you can see other businesses that if they're not if they don't if there's no penalty if there's no real i mean these look these are the companies that gave us the opioid epidemic right so they knew what was gonna happen and we you know you go and see there's a documentary i forgot what the name of it is but it shows exactly what happened and you know they corrupted fda they knew that this that oxycodone was addictive they got fda to tell doctors that it wasn't addictive they pressured fda to lie and they got their way and they've so far they led this year you know those they got a whole generation addicted to oxycodone and now you know when they got caught and they made it we made it harder to get oxycodone and now all those addicted kids are going to fentanyl and dying and this year it killed a hundred and six a hundred and six thousand that's twice as many people who were killed during the viet during the twenty year vietnam war but in one year twice many american kids and they knew it was gonna happen and they did it to make money so i don't know what you call that other than saying that's you know a criminal enterprise was it possible to have within the capitalist system to produce medication to produce drugs at scale in a way that is not corrupt yeah of course it is how through you know through a solid regulatory regimen where drugs are actually tested you know i i mean the problem is not the capitalist system the capitalist system i you know i have great admiration for the that love for the capitalist system is the greatest economic engine ever devised but it has to be harnessed to a social purpose otherwise it's gonna it leads us you know down the the trail of of oligarchy environmental destruction and you know and commoditizing poisoning and and killing human beings that's what it will do in in the end oh you the the ray you need a regulatory structure that is that is not corrupted by entanglements financial entanglements with the industry and we've set this up the way that this is that the system is set up today has created this system of of regulatory capture on steroids so almost fifty percent of fda's budget comes from pharmaceutical companies the people who work at fda are you know their money is coming their salaries are coming from pharma half their salaries so they're you know they know who their bosses are and that means getting those drugs done get getting them out the door and approved as quickly as possible it's called fastrack approval and they pay fifty per fifty percent of fda's budget that goes about forty five percent actually goes to fastrack approval do you think money can buy integrity oh yeah of course it can and right right yeah i mean there's that's not something that is that that is controversial of course it it will so and then controversial to me i would like to think that scientists that will benefit be able to buy your intake i'm talking about population wide i'm not talking about the individual but i'd like to believe that scientists i mean in general career of a scientist is not a very high paying job i'd like to believe that people that go into science that work at fda that work at nih are doing it for a reason that's not even correlated with money really yeah and i think probably that's why they go in there but scientists are corruptible and and almost all of them involve scientific controversies and there are scientists on both sides in everyone when i when we sued monsanto there was on the monsanto side there was a yale scientist a stanford scientist and a harvard scientist and on our side there was a yale stanford and harvard scientist and they were telling saying exactly the opposite things in fact there's a word for those kind of scientists who take money for their opinion and the word is by prostitutes and they are very very common and you know and i've been dealing with with them my whole career you know i i think it was upton sinclair who said that it's very difficult to persuade a man of a fact if the existence of that fact will diminish his salary and i think that's true for all of us if they you know we find a way of reconciling ourselves the things that are to to truths that actually and worldviews that actually benefit our our salaries now nih nih has probably the worst system which is that scientists who work for nih nih itself which used to be the premier gold standard scientific agency in the world everybody looked at nih that today it's just an incubator for pharmaceutical drugs and and you know that is that gravity of economic self interest because if you're if nih itself collects royalties they have margin rights for the patents on all the drugs that they work on so with the moderna vaccine which they promoted incessantly and aggressively nih owned fifty percent of that vaccine and is making billions and billions of dollars on it and there are four at least four scientists that we know of and probably at least six at nih who themselves have rights and rights for those patents so if you are a scientist who work at nih you work on a new drug you then get margin rights and you're entitled to royalties of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year forever from that forever your children your children's children as long as that product's on the market you can collect royalties so you have you know moderna vaccine is paying for the top people at nih you know some of the top regulators is paying for their boats is paying for their mortgages is paying for their children's education and you know you have to expect that the that in those kind of situations the regulatory function would be subsumed beneath the mercantile ambitions of the agency itself and the individuals who stand to profit enormously from getting a drug to market those guys are paid by us the taxpayer to find problems with those drugs before they get to market but if you know that drug is gonna pay for your mortgage you may overlook a little problem and that or even a very big one and that's the problem you've talked about that the media slanders you by calling you an anti vaxxer and you've said that you're not anti vaccine you're pro safe vaccine difficult question can you name any vaccines that you think are good i think some of the live virus vaccines are probably so are earning more problems than they're causing there's no vaccine that is you know safe and effective the infected big words what about the polio can we talk about the well here's the here's the problem yes look yep here's the problem the polio vaccine contained a a virus called semivirus forty sv forty it's it's one of the most carcinogenic materials that is known to men in fact it's used now by scientists around the world to induce tumors in rats and guinea pigs in labs but it was in that vaccine ninety eight million people who got that vaccine in my generation got it and now you've had this explosion of soft tissue cancers in our generation that killed many many many many many more people than polio ever did so if you say to me that the you know the polio vaccine was effective against polio i'm gonna say yes if i say if you say to me did it kill more people that it did it avert caused more deaths than it hurt i i would say i don't know because we don't have the data on that so but let's talk well you know so we kinda have to narrow in on what is it effective against the thing it's supposed to fight oh well a lot of them are let me give you an example the most popular vaccine in the world is the dtpvx indiptheria tetanus and pertussis it was used in this introduced in this country around nineteen eighty that vaccine caused so many injuries that which was the manufacturer was said to the reagan administration we are now paying twenty dollars in downstream liabilities for every dollar that we're making in profits and we are getting out of the business unless you give us permanent immunity from liability so the vaccine companies then were given and and by the way reagan said at that time why don't you just make the vaccine safe and why is that because vaccines are inherently unsafe they they said unavoidably unsafe you cannot make them safe and so when reagan wrote the bill and passed it the bill says in its preambles because vaccines are unavoidably unsafe and the bruceowitz case which was a supreme court case that uphold upheld that bill used that same language vaccines cannot be made safe they're unavoidably unsafe so this is what the law says now i i just wanna finish this story because this illustrates very well your your question that the dtv vaccine was discontinued in this country and it was discontinued in europe because the so many kids were being injured by it however the who and bill gates gives it to a hundred and sixty one million african children every year and bill gates went to the danish government and asked them to support this program saying we've saved thirty million kids from dying from diphtheria tetanus and pertussis the danish government said can you show us the data and he couldn't so the danish government paid for a big study with novo nordisk which is a a scandinavian vaccine company in west africa and they went to west africa and they looked at the d p vaccine for thirty years of data and they they hire they retain the best vaccine scientists in the world these kind of deities of african vaccine program peter aab sigrid morgenson and a bunch of others and they looked at thirty years of data for the the dtp vaccine and they came back and they were shocked by what they found they found that the vaccine was preventing kids from getting diphtheria tetanus and pertussis but the girls who got that vaccine were ten times more likely to die over the next six months than than children who didn't why is that and they weren't dying from anything anybody ever associated with the and they were dying of anemia heart failure malaria sepsis and mainly pulmonary and respiratory disease and pneumonia and it turns out this is what the the that this is what the researchers found we were all pro vaccine by the way they said that this vaccine is killing more children than dip their attendance and pertussis prior to the introduction of the vaccine and for thirty years nobody ever noticed it the vaccine was providing protection against those target illnesses but it had ruined the children's immune systems and they could not defend themselves against random infections that were harmless to most children but isn't it nearly impossible to prove that link isn't it can't prove the link you all you can do is for any particular interest you can't illness or death you can't prove the link but you can show statistically that there is that if you get that vaccine you're more likely to die over the next six months than if you don't and those studies unfortunately are not done for any other vaccines so for every other medicine in order to get approval from the fda you have to do a placebo controlled trial prior to licensor where you you look at health outcomes among a among an exposed group a group that gets it and compare those to a similarly situated group that gets a placebo the only medical intervention that does not receive that does not undergo placebo controlled trials prior to licensed or not one of the seventy two vaccines that are now mandated for our children have ever gone undergone a placebo controlled trial prior to licensure so i should say that there's a bunch on that point i've heard from a bunch of folks that disagree with you okay including polio i mean in the test testing is a really important point before licensure placebo controlled randomized trials polio received just that against the saline placebo control so it it seems unclear to me me i'm confused why you say that that that would they don't go through that process it seems like a lot a lot of them do here's the thing is that i was saying that for many years because we couldn't find any yeah and then in twenty sixteen in march i met president trump ordered doctor fauci to meet with me doctor fauci and francis collins and i said to them during that meeting you have been saying that i'm not telling the truth when i said not one of these has undergone a prior pre licenser mhmm placebo control mhmm and the polio may have had one post license like most of them haven't the polio may have i don't know but i said our question was prior to licensure do you ever test these and for for safety and and by the way i think the polio vaccine did undergo a saline placebo trial prior licensure but not for safety only for efficacy so i'm talking about safety trials now i'm i fauci told me that he was he said i can't find one now he had a whole tray of files there he said i can't find that one now but i'll send you one i said just for any vaccines send me one for any of the seventy two vaccines he never did so we sued the hhs and after a year of stonewalling us hhs came back and they gave us a letter saying we have no prelicensing safe drought for any of the seventy two vaccines and that the letter from hhs which settled our lawsuit against them because we had a foia lawsuit against them is posted on chd's website so anybody can go look at it so if chd if if hhs had any study i assume they would have given it to us and they they can't find one well let me zoom out because a lot of the details matter here pre licensure what does placebo controlled mean i just so this is this probably requires a a a rigorous analysis and actually at this point it would be nice for me just to give this shout out to other people much smarter than me that people should follow along with robert f kennedy junior use their mind learn and think so one really awesome creator i really recommend him is doctor dan wilson he hosted the debunk the funk podcast vincent reganiello who hosts this week in virology brilliant guy i've had him on the podcast somebody you've been battling with is paul offit interesting twitter interesting books people should read and under understand and read your books as well and eric topol has a good twitter and good books and even peter hotez i'll ask you about him and people should because paul offit published a a substack recently debunking i think my my discussion with with joe rogan and and we have published a debunk of his debunking mhmm you know so if you read his stuff you should read read both yes you should read and i would love to debate any of these guys so joe joe rogan proposed just such a debate which is quite fascinating to see how much attention and how much funding it it garnered the debate between you and peter hotez why do you think peter rejected the offer i think it's i i you know again i'm not gonna look into his head but what i will say is if you're a scientist and you're making public recommendations based upon what you say is evidence based science you ought to be able to defend that you ought to be able to defend it in a public forum and you ought to be able to defend it against you know all comers and you know so i i you know if you're a scientist science is based on is rooted in logic and reason and if you can't use logic and reason to defend your position and by the way i know almost all of the studies i mean you know i've written books on them and we've made a big effort to assemble all the studies on both sides and so i'm prepared to talk about those studies and i'm prepared to submit them in advance you know and for each of the points and by the way i've done that with peter hotez you know i've i've actually because i had this this kind of informal debate with him several years ago with a with a a referee at that time and we were debating not only by phone but by email and on those emails every point that he would make i would cite science and he could never come back with science he could never come back with publications he would give publications that had nothing to do with for example thimerosal and vaccines mercury based vaccines he sent me one time sixteen studies to to to rebut something i'd said about thimerosal and not one of those studies they were all about the mmr vaccine vaccine which doesn't contain thimerosal so it it wasn't like a real debate where you're you know you're you're using reason and isolating points and having a you know a rational discourse i don't think that he i don't blame him for not debating me because i don't think he has the the science are there aspects of all the work you've done on vaccines all the advocacy you've done that you found out that you were not correct on that you were wrong on it that you've changed your mind on yeah there are many times over time that i you know i found that i've made mistakes and we correct those mistakes you know i run a big organization and i do a lot of tweets you know i'm very careful for example my instagram i was taken down for for misinformation but there was no misinformation on my instagram everything that i cited on instagram was cited or sourced to a government database or to peer reviewed science but for example the defender which was our our organization's newsletter we summarize scientific reports all the time that's one of the things the services that we provide but we watch the you know pubmed and we watch the peer reviewed publications and we summarize them when they come out we have made mistakes when we make mistake we are rigorous about acknowledging it apologizing for it and changing it that's what we do i think we have one of the most robust fact checking operations anywhere in journalism today we actually do real science and you know there listen i've put up on my twitter account and i there's there are numerous times that i've made mistakes on twitter and i apologize for it and people say to me you know oh that's weird i've never seen anybody apologize on twitter and i think it's really important that the only of course human beings make mistakes my book is you know two hundred and thirty forty fifty thousand words there's gonna be a mistake in there but you know what i say at the beginning of the book if you see a mistake in here please notify me i give a way that people can notify me and if somebody points out a mistake i'm gonna change it i'm not gonna dig my feet in and say you know i'm not gonna acknowledge this so some of the things we've been talking about you've you've been an outspoken contrarian on some very controversial topics this has garnered some fame and recognition in part for being attacked and standing strong against those attacks if i may say for being a martyr do you worry about the this drug of martyrdom that might cloud your judgment first of all yeah i don't consider myself a martyr and i've never considered myself a victim i make choices about my life and i you know and i'm i'm content with those choices and peaceful with them i'm not trying to be a martyr or a hero or anything else i'm doing what i think is right because i wanna be peaceful inside of myself but i the only guard i have is just is you know fact based reality if you show me a scientific study that shows that i'm wrong for example if you come back and say look bobby here's a polio here's a a safety study on polio that was done prelicensure and used a a real saline solution i'm gonna put that on my twitter and i'm gonna say i was wrong there is one out there so you know but that's all i can do alright i have to ask you are in great shape can you go through your diet and exercise routine i i do intermittent fasting so i eat between i start have my first meal at around noon mhmm and then i try to stop eating at six or seven mhmm and then i i i hike every day morning evening in the morning i go to a meeting first thing in the morning twelve set meeting and then i go hike for and i hike uphill for a mile and a half up and a mile and a half down with my dogs and i do my meditations and then i go to the gym and i go to the gym for thirty five minutes mhmm i don't i do it short time i've been exercising for fifty years and what i found is it's sustainable if you know if i do just the short periods and i do four different routines at the gym mhmm and i never relax at the gym i go in there and i have a very intense exercise i lift you know i mean i i i could tell you what my routine is but i do i do backs one day back chest one day legs and then a miscellaneous and i do twelve my first set of everything is is i try to i try to reach failure at twelve reps and then my fourth set of everything is a strip set i do i take a lot of vitamins i i can't even listen to you here because i you know i i i couldn't even remember them all but i take a ton of vitamins and nutrients i take i'm on an antiaging protocol from my doctor that includes testosterone replacement and but i don't take any steroids i don't take any anabolic steroids or anything like that and the drt i use is is bioidentical to what my body produced what are your thoughts on hormone therapy in general i talked to a lot of doctors about that stuff you know because i'm interested in health and you know i've heard really good things about it but i don't know i'm i'm definitely not an expert on it about god you wrote god talks to human beings through many vectors wise people organize religion the great books of religions through art music and poetry but nowhere was such detail and grace and joy as through creation when we destroy nature we diminish our capacity to sense the divine what is your relationship and what is your understanding of god who is god well i mean god is incomprehensible you know i mean i guess the the most philosophers would say we're you know we're inside the mind of god and so it would be impossible for us to understand and you know what actually what you know what god's form is or but i mean for me i have a let's say this i had when i was i was raised in a very very deeply religious setting so we went to church in the summer oftentimes twice a day the morning mass and we went to we definitely went every sunday and we and i went we prayed in the morning we prayed before and after every meal we prayed at night we sent a rosary sometimes three rosaries a night and my father read us the bible when whenever he was home he would read us you know we'd all get in the bed and he'd read us the bible stories i and i went to catholic schools i went to jesuit schools i went to the nuns and i went to a quaker school at one point when i i became a drug addict when i was about fifteen years old about a year after my dad died and i was addicted to drugs for fourteen years during that time when you're an addict you're living against conscience and when you're living and i never you know i i was always trying to get off of drugs never able to but i never felt good about what i was doing and and when you're living against conscious you kinda push god to the per peripheries of your life so call me he gets recedes and gets smaller and then when i when i got sober i knew that i had a couple of experiences one is that i had a a friend of my brother's one of my brothers who died of this disease of addiction had a good friend who had used to take drugs with us and he became a mooney so he he became a follower of reverend's son young moon and he's at that point his compulsion he had the same kind of compulsion that i had and yet it was completely removed from him and so and he used to come and hang out with us but he would not wanna take drugs even if i was taken right in front of him him he was he was immune to it he'd become impervious to that impulse and i when i was in the when i first got sober i was i knew that i did not wanna be the kind of person who was you know waking up every day in white knuckling sobriety and just you know trying to resist resist through willpower and by the way i had i had iron willpower as a kid i gave up candy for lent when i was twelve and i didn't eat it again till i was in college i gave up i gave up desserts the next year for lent and i didn't never ate another dessert till i was in college and i was trying to bulk up for rugby and for sports so i felt like i could do anything with my willpower but somehow this particular thing you know the the addiction was completely impervious to it and i it was cunning baffling baffling incomprehensible i could not understand and so i was living against conscience and i and i i thought about this guy and i you know reflecting my own prejudices at that time in my life i was i said to myself i didn't wanna be i didn't wanna be like a drug addict who was wanting a drug all the time and just not being able to do it i wanted to completely realign my my myself so that i was somebody who got up every day and just didn't wanna take drugs never thought of them you know i kissed the wife and children and went to work and was never thought about drugs the whole day and i knew that people throughout history had done that you know i read the lives of the saints i knew saint augustine had met a very very dissolute youth and and you know i had the spiritual realignment transformation i knew the same thing had happened to saint paul you know damascus the same thing had happened to saint francis saint francis also had a had a dissolute and fun loving youth and and had you know had this this deep spiritual realignment and i i knew that that happened to people throughout history and i thought that's what i needed you know something like that i had the example of this friend of mine and i used to think about him and i would think and this again reflects the the bias and the you know probably the meanness of myself at that time but i'd i said i'd rather be dead than be a moony but i wish i somehow could distill that power that he got without becoming a religious nuisance and and at that time i picked up a book by carl jung called synchronicity and jung he was a psychiatrist he was a contemporary of freud's he was a freud was his mentor and and freud wanted him to be his replacement but freud was an avowed atheist and young was a deeply spiritual man he had these very intense and genuine spiritual experiences from when he was a little boy from nearly three years old that he remembers biography is fascinating he he was he had written he was always he was interesting to me because he was a very faithful scientist and i consider myself a science based person from when i was little and yet he had this spiritual dimension to him which infused all of his thinking and really i think made him you know it is branded his his form of of recovery or of of treatment and he thought that he had this experiment experience that he describes in this book where he's sitting up on the third he ran one of the biggest sanitariums in europe in zurich and he was sitting up on the third floor of this building and he's talking to a patient who had a who was talking describing her dream to him and the fulcrum of that dream was a scarab beetle which was an insect that is not is very very uncommon if at all in northern europe but it's a common figure in the iconography of of egypt and the hieroglyphics on the on the walls of the pyramids etcetera and he and he while he was talking to her he heard this bing bing bing on the window behind him and he didn't wanna turn around to take his attention off her but finally he does it he's he in exasperation he turns around he throws up the window and a scarab beetle flies in and lands in his head and he shows it to the woman and he says is this what you were thinking of is this what you were dreaming about and he he was struck by that experience which was similar to other experiences he's had like that and that's what synchronicity means it's a it's a a an incident or coincidence you know and like if so if you're if you're talking with somebody about somebody that you haven't thought about in twenty years and that person calls on the phone that's synchronicity oh and he believed it was a way that god intervened in our lives that broke all the all the rules of nature that he had set up the rules of physics the rules of mathematics or you know to reach in and sort of tap us on their shoulder and say i'm here and and so he tried to reproduce that in a clinical setting and he would put one guy in one room and another guy in another room and have them flip cards and then guess what the other guy had flipped and he believed that if he could beat the laws of chance laws of mathematics that he would approve the existence of this of an of an unnatural law a supernatural law and that was the first step to proving the existence of a god he never succeeds in doing it but he says in the book even though i can't prove using empirical and scientific tools the existence of a god i can show through anecdotal evidence having seen thousands of patients come through this institution that people who believe in god get better faster and that the recovery is more enduring than people who don't and for me hearing that was more impactful than if he had claimed that he had proved the existence of god because i wouldn't have believed that but i i was already at a mindset where i would have done anything i could to improve my chances of never having to take drugs again by even one percent and if believing in god was gonna help me whether there's a god up there or not believing in one a self had the power to help me i was gonna do that so then the question is how do you start believing in something that you can't see or smell or hear or touch or taste or acquire with your senses and jung provides the formula for that and he says he says act as if you fake it till you make it and so that's you know what i started doing i just started pretending there was a god watching me all the time and kind of life was a series of tests and each there was a bunch of moral decisions that i had to make every day and each one you know these were all just little things that i did but each one now for me at a moral dimension like when i you know when the alarm goes off do i lay in bed for an extra ten minutes with my indolent thoughts or do i jump right out of bed do i do i make my bed most important decision of the day do i hang up the towels you know do or do i do i when i go into the closet and pull out my blue jeans and a bunch of those wire hangers fall on the ground do i shut the door and say i'm too much i'm too important to do that at somebody else's job or not and so do i put the water in the ice tray before of the safeway and if i make a whole bunch of those choices right that i maintain myself in a posture of surrender which keeps me open to the power of to my higher power like to my god and when that when i do those things right when i you know so much about addiction is about abuse of power you know abuse of all of us have some power whether it's our you know good looks or whether it's you know connections or education or or family or whatever and there's always a tempt a temptation to use those to fill fulfill self will and the challenge is how do you use those always to serve instead god's will and you know the the good of our community and that to me is kind of the struggle and when i do that i feel i feel god's power coming through me and that i can do things i'm much more effective as a human being that that gnawing you know anxiety that i lived with for so many years and my god that i it's gone and that i can kind of like put down the oars and hoist the sail and you know and the wind takes me and i can i can see the evidence of it in my life and you know the big thing for you know the temptation for me is that when all these good things start happening in my life and the cash and prizes start flowing in you know how do i maintain that posture of surrender how do i surrender then when my inclination is to say to god thanks god i got it from here yeah and drive the car off the cliff again and so you know i had a spiritual awakening and my desire for drugs and alcohol was lifted miraculously and it to me it was as much a miracle as if i had if i'd been able to walk on water because i had tried everything earnestly sincerely and honestly for a a decade to try to stop and i could not do it under my own power and then all of a sudden it was lifted effortlessly and you know so i saw that evidence early evidence of god in my life and and of the power and and i see it now you know every day of my life so adding that moral dimension to all of your actions is how you're able to win that camu battle against the absurd exactly with the boldness it's all the same thing it's the battle to just to do the right thing and now it's as if this was able to find somehow happiness yeah well bobby thank you for the stroll through some of the most important
