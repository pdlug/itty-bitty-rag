in your lecture on the basics of finance and investing you mentioned a book intelligent investor by benjamin graham as being formative in your life what key lesson do you take away from that book that informs your own investing sure actually it was the first investment book i read and as such it was kind of the inspiration for my career and a lot of my life so important book you know bear in mind this is sort of after the great depression people lost confidence investing in markets world war two and then he writes his book it's for like the average man and basically he says that you have to understand the difference between price and value right price is what you pay value is what you get and he said the stock market is here to serve you right and it's a bit like the neighbor that comes by every day and makes you an offer for your house makes you a stupid offer you ignore it makes you a great offer you can take it and that's the stock market and the key is to figure out what something's worth and you have to kind of weigh it he talked about the difference between you know he said the stock market in the short term is a voting machine it represents speculative interests you know supply and demand of people in the short term but in the long term it's the stock market's a weighing machine much more accurate it's gonna tell you what something's worth and so if you can divine what something's worth then you can really take advantage of the market because it's really here to to help you and that's kind of the message of the book in that same way there's a kind of difference between speculation and investing yeah speculation is just it's a bit like buying trading crypto right you're strong words well short term trading crypto maybe in the long run there's intrinsic value but the you know it's many investors you know in a bubble going into the you know the crash were really just pure pure speculators they didn't know what things were worth they just knew they were going up right that's speculation and investing is you know doing your homework digging down understanding a business understanding the competitive dynamics of an industry understanding what management's gonna do understanding what price you're gonna pay you know the value of anything i would say other than love let's say is the present value of the cash you can take out of it over its life now some people think about love that way but it's not it's not the right way to think about love but it's yeah so investing is about basically building a a model of what this business is gonna produce over its lifetime so how do you get to that this idea of called value investing how do you get to the value of a thing even like philosophically value of anything really but we can just talk about the things that are on the stock market sure companies the value of a a security the value is the present value of the cash you can take out of it over its life so if you think about a bond you know bond you know pays a five percent coupon interest rate you get that you know let's say every year or twice a year split in half and it's very predictable and if it's a us government bond you know you're gonna get it so that's a pretty easy thing to value a stock is an interest in a business it's like owning a piece of a company and a business a profitable one is like a bond in that it generates these coupons or these earnings or cash flow you know every year the difference with a stock and a bond is that the bond it's a contract you know what you're gonna get as long as they don't go bankrupt and default with a stock you have to make predictions about the business you know how many widgets are gonna sell this year how many are gonna sell next year what what are the costs gonna be how much of the money that they generate do they need to reinvest in the business to keep the business going and that's more complicated but you know what we do is we try to find businesses where with a very high degree of confidence we know what those cash flows are gonna be for a very long time and there are very few businesses that you can have really high degree of certainty about as a result you know many investments are speculations because it's really very difficult to predict the future so we what we do for a living what i do for a living is find those rare companies that you can kinda predict what they're gonna look like over a very long period of time so what are the factors that indicate that a company is something is going to be something that's going to make a lot of money it's it's gonna have a lot of value and it's going to be reliable over a long period of time and what is your process of figuring out whether a company is or isn't that so every consumer has a view on different brands and different companies and you know what we look for are sort of these nondisruptible businesses a business where you can kinda close your eyes stock market shuts for a decade and you know that ten years from now it's gonna be a more valuable more profitable company so we own a business called universal music group it's in the business of helping artists become global artists sort of recorded music business and it's in the business of you know owning rights to sort of music publishing rights of songwriters and you know i think music is forever right music is a many thousand year old part of the human experience and i think it will be you know thousands of years from now and so that's a pretty good backdrop to invest in a company and the company basically owns a third of the global recorded music that's you know the most dominant sort of market share in the business they're the best at taking an artist who's eighteen years old who's got a great voice and has started to get a presence on youtube and instagram and helping that artist become a superstar and that's a unique talent and the result is the best artists in the world wanna come work for them but they also have this incredible library of you know the beatles the rolling stones u2 etcetera so and then if you think about what music has become used to be about records and cds and you know eight track tapes for those of whom and it was about a new format and that's how they drive sales and it's become a business which is like the podcast business about streaming and you can streaming is a lot more predictable than what than selling records right you can sort of say okay how many people have smartphones how many people are gonna have smartphones next year there's a kind of global penetration or time of smartphones you pay call it ten eleven bucks a month for a subscription or last for a family plan and you can kind of build a model of what the world looks like and predict you know the growth of the streaming business you predict what kind of market share universal is gonna have over time and you can't get to a precise view of value you can get to an approximation and the key is to buy at a price that represents a big discount to that approximation and that gets back to ben graham ben graham was about what he called invented this concept of margin of safety right you wanna buy a company at a price that if you're wrong about what you think it's worth and it turns out to be worth thirty percent less you paid a deep enough discount to your estimate that you're still okay it's about investing a big part of investing is not losing money if you can avoid losing money and then have a few great hits you can do very very well over time well music is interesting because yes music's been around for a very long time but the way to make money from music has been evolving like you mentioned streaming there's a big transition initiated by i guess napster then created spotify mhmm of how you make money on music with with apple and with all of this and the question is how well are companies like umg able to adjust its transformations one i could ask you about the future which is artificial intelligence being able to generate music for example sure should there have been a lot of amazing advancements with so do you have to also think about that like when you close your eyes all the things you think about are you imagining the possible ways that the the future is completely different from the the present and how well this company will be able to like surf the wave of that sure and they've had to surf a lot of waves and actually the music business peaked the last time in like the late nineties or two thousand time frame and that really innovation napster digitization of music almost killed the industry and universal really led an effort to save the industry and actually made an early deal with spotify that enabled you know the the industry to really recover and so by virtue of their market position and their credibility and their willingness to kind of adopt new technologies they've kept their position now they of course had this huge advantage because i think the beatles are forever i think u2 is forever i think rolling stones are forever so they had a nice base of of assets that were important and i think will forever be and forever is a long time but you know the again there's enormous there are all kinds of risks in every business this is one that i think has a very high degree of persistence and i can't envision a world where beyond streaming in a sense now you may have a neuralink chip in your head that instead of a phone but the the music can come in a digitized you know kind of format you're gonna wanna have an infinite library that you can walk around in your pocket or in your brain it's not gonna matter that much at the form factor you know the device changes it's not really that important whether it's spotify or apple or amazon that are the so called dsps or the or the providers i think the values really kinda reside in the in the content owners and that's really the artists and the label and i actually think ai is not going to be the primary creator of music i think we're going to actually face the reality that it's not that music has been around for a thought thousands of years but musicians and music has been around like we actually care to know who's the musician that created it just like we wanna know that who's the artist human artist that created a piece of art i totally agree and i think if you think about it there's other lots of other technologies and computers that have been used to generate music over time but no one wants to no one falls in love with a computer generated track right and you know taylor swift you know you know incredible music but it's also about the artist and her story and her physical presence and you know the the live experience i don't think you're gonna sit there and someone's gonna put computer up on stage and and then and it's gonna play and people are gonna get excited around it so i think ai is really gonna be a tool to make artists better artists and and you know the i think like a synthesizer right really created the opportunity for you know one man to have an orchestra maybe a bit of a threat to a percussionist but maybe not maybe it drove even more demand for for for the live experience unless that computer has human like sentience which i believe is a real possibility but then it's really from a business perspective no different than a human if it has an identity that's basically fame and influence and there'll be a robot taylor swift and it doesn't that's a copyrightable asset i would think mhmm right yeah and then there'll be i'm not sure that's the world i'm excited about that's a different discussion so the world is not gonna ask your permission to become what it's becoming so but you could still make money on it presumably there'd be a capital system and there'd be some laws under which ai which i believe ai systems will have rights that are akin to human rights and we're gonna have to contend with what that means well there's sort of name and likeness rights yes right that have to be protected now can a name be attributed to a tesla robot i don't know i think so i think it's quite obvious to me so those are more more potential artists for us to represent at university exactly exactly alright that that's sort of one example another example could be just you know the restaurant industry right if you can if you look at businesses like a mcdonald's right it's a whatever the company's like a nineteen fifty vintage business and here we are it's you know seventy five years later and you can kinda predict what it's gonna look like over time and the menu's gonna you know adjust over time to consumer tastes and but i think the hamburger and fries is probably forever the beatles the rolling stones the hamburger and fries are forever yeah i was eating at chipotle last night as i was preparing these notes thank you thank you and yeah it is it is one of my favorite places to eat you said it is a place that you eat we you obviously also invest in it what do you get at chipotle i tend to get a double chicken bowl or burrito i i like the burrito but i i generally try to order the bowl yeah cut the carb for health reasons alright and you know double chicken guac lettuce black beans and i'm i'm more of a steak guy just just putting that on the record what's the actual process you go through like literally like the process of figuring out what the value of a company is like how do you do the research mhmm is it reading documents is it talking to people is it how do you do it it's all about so chipotle what attracted us initially is the stock price dropped by about fifty percent great company great concept you know athletes love it consumers love it healthy sustainable fresh food made in front of your eyes and you know great steve ells the founder did an amazing job but ultimately the company's lacking some of the systems and had a food safety issue consumers got sick almost killed the rent but the reality of the fast food quick service industry is almost every fast food company has had a food safety issue over time and the vast majority have survived and we said look such a great concept but they you know their approach was not it was far from ideal but we start with usually reading the sec filings so companies file a ten k or an annual report and they file these quarterly reports called ten q's they have a proxy statement which describes kind of the governance the board structure conference call transcripts are publicly available it's kind of very helpful to go back five years and kind of learn the story you know here's how management describes their business here's what they say they're gonna do then you can follow along to see what they do it's like a historical record of you know of how competent and truthful they are you know it's a very useful device and then of course looking at competitors and thinking about you know who could what could dislodge this company you know and then we'll talk to if it's an industry we don't know well we know the restaurant industry really well music industry you know we'll talk to people in the industry we'll try to understand you know the difference between publishing and recorded music we'll look at the competitors we'll talk to we'll read books i read a book about the music industry or a couple books about the industry so it's it's a bit like a big research project and you these so called expert networks now and you can get pretty much anyone on the phone and they'll talk to you about an aspect of the industry that you don't understand wanna learn more about try to get a sense you know public filings of companies generally give you a lot of information but not everything you want to know and you can learn more by talking to experts about some of the industry dynamics the personalities you wanna get a sense of management i like watching you know podcasts if a ceo were to do a podcast or a youtube interview you get a sense of the people so in the case of chipotle for example by the way i could talk about chipotle all day i just love it i love it i wish there was a sponsor i'll mention it to the ceo don't make promises you can't keep bill i'm not making i can't alright brian nichols is a fantastic ceo he's not gonna spend one dollar that he doesn't think think it's the company's best interest alright all i want is free chipotle come on now what was i saying oh and so you look at a company like chipotle and then you see there's a difficult moment in in its history like you said that there was a food safety issue and then you say okay well i see a path where we can fix this and therefore even though the price is low we can get it to where the price goes up to its value mhmm so the kind of business we're looking for is sort of the kind of business everyone should be looking for right a great business it's got a long term trajectory of growth out into the force you know even beyond the foreseeable distance right those are the kind of businesses you want to own you want businesses that generate a lot of cash you want businesses you can easily understand you want businesses with these sort of huge barriers to entry where it's difficult for others to compete you want companies that don't have to constantly raise capital and these are some of the great business of the world but people have figured out that those are the great businesses so the problem is those companies tend to have very high stock prices and the value is generally built into the price you have to pay for the business so we can't earn the kind of returns we want to earn for investors by paying a really high price price matters a lot you can buy the best business in the world and if you overpay you're not gonna earn particularly attractive returns so we get involved in cases where a great business has kind of made a big mistake or they've or you've a company that's kinda lost its way but it's recoverable and that's we buy from shareholders who are disappointed and have lost confidence selling at a low price relative to what it's worth if fixed and then we try to be helpful in fixing the company you said that barriers to entry you you said a lot of really interesting qualities of companies very quickly in a sequence of statements that took like less than ten seconds to say but some of them were fascinating all of them were fascinating so you said barriers to entry mhmm how do you know if there's a type of moat protecting the competitors from stepping up to the plate the most difficult analysis to do as an investor is that it's kind of figuring out how wide is the moat how you know how much at risk is the business to disruption and we're in i would say a period the greatest period of disruptability in history right technology you know a couple of nineteen year olds can you know leave whatever university or maybe they didn't go in the first place they can raise you know millions of dollars they can get access to infinite bandwidth storage they can contract with engineers in low cost markets around the world they could build a virtual company and they can disrupt businesses that seem super established over time and then on top of that you have major companies with multi trillion dollar market caps working to find profits wherever they can and so that's a dangerous world in a way to be an investor and so you wanna you have to find businesses that it's hard to foresee a world in which they get disrupted and the beauty of the restaurant business and we've actually our best track record is in restaurants we've never lost money we've only made a fortune interestingly investing restaurants a big part of it's a really simple business and if you you know get chipotle right and you're at a hundred stores you know it's not so hard to envision getting to two hundred stores and then getting to five hundred stores right and the key is maintaining the brand image growing intelligently having the right systems you know and when you go from a hundred stores to three thousand five hundred stores you have to know what you're doing there's a lot of complexity right you know if you think about your local restaurant you know the family's working in the business they're they're watching the cash register and you can probably open another restaurant you know they're across town but there are very few restaurant operators that own more than a few restaurants and operate them successfully and the and the quick service business is about systems and building a model that a stranger who doesn't know the restaurant industry can come in and enter the business and build a successful successful franchise now chipotle is not a franchise company they actually own all their own stores but many of the most successful restaurant companies are franchise models like a burger king a mcdonald's tim hortons you know all these various brands popeyes and there it's about systems but the same systems apply whether you own all the stores and it's run by a big corporation or whether the owners of the restaurants are are sort of franchisees you know local entrepreneurs so if the restaurant has scaled to a certain number that means they've figured out some kind of system that works yeah it's very difficult to develop that kind of system so that's a moat a moat is you get to a certain scale and you do it successfully and the brands is now in the in the understood by the consumer and what's interesting about chipotle is what they've achieved is difficult right they're not buying frozen hamburgers getting shipped in they're buying fresh you know sustainably sourced ingredients they're preparing food in the store that was a first right the quality of the product at chipotle is incredible it's the highest quality food you can get for you can get a serious dinner for under twenty bucks and eat really health you know healthfully and very high quality ingredients and that's just not available anywhere else and it's very hard to replicate and to build those relationships with you know farmers around the country it's a lot easier to make a deal with one of the big you know massive food producers and buy your pork from them than to buy from a whole bunch of farmers around the country and so it's that is a big moat for chipotle very difficult to replicate and by the way another company i think you have a stake is is mcdonald's no we own a company called restaurant brands restaurant brands owns a number of quick service companies one of which is burger king burger king okay well it's been a meme for a while but i've burger king is great too wendy's whatever but i'd usually go mcdonald's i'll just eat burger patties i don't know if you you knew you could do this but a burger patty at burger king can do this mcdonald's it's actually way cheaper they'll just sell you the patty the patty and it's cheap it's like a dollar fifty or two dollars per patty and it's about two hundred fifty calories and it's just me and despite like the criticism and memes out there that's pretty healthy stuff it's healthy stuff and so when i do when i go my the healthiest i feel is when i do carnivore it doesn't sound healthy but if i eat only meat i feel really good i lose weight i have all this energy it's crazy and the when i'm traveling the easiest way to to get me is that so you go to mcdonald's and order six patties exactly so there's this sad meme of me just sitting alone in a car when i'm traveling just eating beef patties and mcdonald's but i love it and you gotta do what what you love what makes you happy and that's what makes me happy we should maybe we'll have burger king feature in it what about flame broiled what what's with these fried burgers we gotta get you to burger king you know grilled burgers wait is this like fast food trash i didn't know i don't know the details of how they're made i'm not ah you should i don't have allegiance i think we got a chance to switch you to burger king great we'll see i'm i'm making so many deals today it's wonderful okay you were talking about most and this kinda remind me of alphabet the parent company mhmm sure we're made we're it's a big position for us so it's interesting that you're think that maybe alphabet fits some of these characteristics it's tricky to know with everything that's happening in in ai and i'm interviewing sundar pichai soon it's interesting that you think that there's a moat and it's also interesting to analyze it because the consumer is just a fan of technology why is google still around like they've been it's not just the search engine is doing it all the basics of the business of search really well but they're doing all these other stuff so what what's your analysis of alphabet why are you still positive about it sure so it's a business we've admired as a firm for you know whatever fifteen years but rarely got to a price that we felt we could own it because again the expectations were so high and price really matters and really the sort of ai scare i would call it microsoft comes out with chat gpt they do an amazing demonstration people like this most incredible product and google which had been working on ai even earlier obviously the microsoft microsoft was behind in ai that was really their chat gpt deal that gave them a kind of a a market presence and then google does this fairly disastrous demonstration of bard and the world says oh my god google's fallen behind in ai ai is the future stock gets crushed google gets to a price around fifteen times earnings which for a business of this quality is an extremely extremely low price and our view on google one way to think about it when a business becomes a verb mhmm that's usually pretty good sign about the mode around the business so you know you'd open your computer and you open your search and very high percentage of the world starts with a google you know page in one line where you type in your your search you know the google advertising search youtube franchise is one of the most dominant franchises in the world very difficult to disrupt extremely profitable the world is moving from offline advertising to online advertising and that trend i think continues why because you can actually see with your ads work you know they used to say about advertising you know spend a fortune and you just don't know which fifty percent of it works but you just sort of spend the money because you know ultimately that's going to bring in the customer and now with online advertising you can see with granularity which dollars i'm spending you know when people click on the search term and end up buying something and i pay you know the it's a very high return on investment for the advertiser and they really dominate that business now ai of course is a risk if all of a sudden people start searching or asking questions of chatgpt and don't start with the google search bar that's a risk to the company and so our view based on work we had done and talked to industry experts is that google if anything had a a by virtue of the the investment they've made the time the energy that people put into it we felt their ai capabilities were if anything potentially greater than microsoft chat gpt and that the market had overreacted and because google you know is a big company global business regulators scrutinize it incredibly carefully they couldn't take some of the same liberties a startup like openai did in releasing a product and i think google took a more cautious approach in releasing an early version of bard in terms of its capabilities and that let lamarck the world to believe that they were behind and we ultimately concluded if any they're tied or ahead and you're paying nothing for the that potential business and they're gonna and they also have huge advantages by virtue you think of all the data google has like the search data all the various app you know applications you know email and otherwise the kind of the google suite of of products it's an incredible data set so they have more training data than pretty much any company in the world they have incredible engineers they have enormous financial resources so that was kind of the bet and and we still think it's probably the cheapest of the big seven companies in terms of price you're paying for the business relative to its current earnings it also is a business that has a lot of potential for efficiency you know sometimes when you have this enormously profitable dominant company you know all of the technology companies in the post march twenty world grew enormously in terms of their teams and they probably overhired and so you've seen some you know the facebooks of the world and now even google starting to get a little more efficient in terms of their operation so they paid a low multiple for their the business one way to think about the value of the business is the price you pay for the earnings or alternatively what's the yield if you flip over the price over the earnings it gives you kind of the yield of the business so a fifteen multiple is about a almost a seven and a half percent yield and that earnings yield is growing over time as the business grows that's a you know compared to what you can earn lending your money to the government you know four percent that's a very attractive going in yield and then there's all kinds of what we call optionality in all the various businesses and investments they've made that are losing money they've got a cloud business that's growing very rapidly but they're investing basically one hundred percent of the profits from that business and growth so you're in that earnings number you're not seeing any earnings from the cloud business and you know they're one of the top cloud players so very interesting generally well managed company with incredible assets and resources and dominance you know and it has no debt it's got a ton of cash and so pretty good story is there something fundamentally different about ai that makes all of this more complicated which is the sort of the exponential possibilities of the kinds of products and impact that ai could create when you're looking at meta microsoft alphabet google all these companies xai or maybe start ups like is is there some more risk introduced by the possibilities of ai absolutely that's a great question you know business investing is about finding companies that can't be disrupted ai is the ultimate disruptable asset or technology and it that's what makes investing treacherous is that you own a business that's enormously profitable management gets if you will fat and happy and then a new technology emerges that just takes away all their profitability and ai is this incredibly powerful tool which is why every business is saying how can i use ai in my business to make us more profitable more successful grow faster and also disrupt or protect ourselves from the you know the incomings you know it's a bit like you know buffett talks about a great business like a castle surrounded by this really wide moat but you have all these barbarians trying to get in and steal the princess and it happens you know kodak for example was an amazing incredibly dominant company until it disappeared polaroid you know this incredible technology and that's why we have tended to stay away from companies that are technology companies because technology companies generally the world is such a dynamic place that someone's always working on a better version and you know kodak was caught up in the analog film world and then the world changed well google was pretty fat and happy until tragedy petite came out yes how would you rate their ability to wake up lose weight and be less happy and aggressively rediscover their search for happiness i think you've seen a lot of that in the last year and i would say some combination of embarrassment and pride are huge motivators for everyone from sergey brin you know to the management of the company and demas hassabis throw them in in into the picture and all of deepmind teams and the unification of teams and like all the shake ups it was interesting to watch yeah the chaos i love it i love it when everybody freaks out like you said partly embarrassment and partly that competitive drive that drives engineers is great i can't wait to see what there's been just a lot of improvement in the product let's see let's see where it goes you mentioned management how do you analyze the governance structure and the individual humans that are the managers of a company so as i like to say incentives drive all human behavior and that certainly applies in the business world so understanding the people and what drives them and what the actual financial and other incentives of a business are very important part of the analysis for investing in a company and you can learn a lot you know i mentioned before one great way to learn about a business is go back a decade and read everything that management has written about the business and see what they've done over time see what they've said you know conference calls are actually you know relatively recent when i started in the business there weren't conference call transcripts now you have you know a written record of everything management has said in response to questions from analysts at conferences and otherwise and so just you learn a lot about people by listening to what they say how they answer questions and ultimately their track record for doing what they say they're going to do do they under promise and over deliver do they over promise and under deliver do they say what they're going to do do they admit mistakes do they build great teams do people want to come work for them or are they able to retain their talent you know and then part of it is do they how much are they running the business for the benefit of the business how much are they running the business for the benefit of themselves and you know that's kind of the analysis you do are we talking about ceo coo what what what does management mean oh how how deep does it go sure so this very senior management matters enormously you know we use the chipotle example steve ells great entrepreneur business got to a scale he really couldn't run it we recruited a guy named brian helped a company recruit a guy named brian nicoll and he was considered the best person in the quick service industry he came in and completely rebuilt the company actually we moved the company chipotle was moved to california and sometimes one way to redo the culture of a company is just to move it geographically and then you can kind of reboot the business but a great leader has great followership you know well over the course of their career they'll have a team they've built that will come follow them into the next opportunity but the key is you know really the top guy person matters enormously because and then it's who they recruit you know you recruit an a plus leader and they're going to recruit other a type people if you're a b leader you're not gonna recruit any great talent beneath them you mentioned warren buffett you said you admire him as an investor what do you find most interesting and powerful about his approach what aspects of his approach to investing do you also practice sure so most of what i've learned in the investment business i've learned from warren buffett he's been my great professor of this business i my first book i read in the business was the ben graham intelligent investor but fairly quickly you get to learn about warren buffett and i started by reading the berkshire hathaway annual reports and then i eventually got the buffett partnership letters that you could see which are an amazing read to go back to the nineteen mid nineteen fifties and read what he wrote to his limited partners when he first started out and just follow that trajectory over a long period of time so what's remarkable about him is one duration right he's still out of it at ninety three you know two you know takes a very long term view but a big thing that you learn from him investing requires this incredible dispassionate unemotional quality you have to be extremely economically rational which is not a basic not something you learn in the jungle you know i don't think it's something that you know if you think about the the you know surviving the jungle you know the lion shows up you know you and everyone starts running you run with them that does not work well in markets in fact you generally have to do the opposite right when the lemmings are running over the cliff that's the time where you're facing the other direction and you're running the other direction i e you're stepping in you're buying stocks at really low prices buffett's been great at that and great at teaching about what he calls temperament which is this sort of emotional kind of or unemotional quality that you need to be able to dispassionately look at the world and say okay is this a real risk are people overreacting people tend to get excited about investments when stocks are going up and they get depressed when they're going down and that i think that's just inherently human you have to reverse that you have to get excited when things get cheaper and you gotta get concerned when things get more expensive you've been a part of some big battles some big losses some big wins so it's been a roller coaster mhmm so in terms of temperament psychologically how do you not let that break you how do you maintain a calm demeanor and avoid running with the lemmings i think it's something you kinda learn over time a key success factor is you want to have enough money in the bank that you're going to survive you know regardless of what's going on with volatility in markets you know people who one you shouldn't borrow money so if you borrow money you own stocks on margin markets are going down and you have your livelihood at risk it's very difficult to be rational so key is getting yourself to a place where you're financially secure you're not gonna lose your house right that's a kind of a key thing and then also doing your homework you know stock prices stocks can trade at any price in the short term and if you know what a business is worth and you understand the management you know it extremely well it's not nearly as it doesn't bother you when a stock price goes down mhmm or it has much less impact on you because you know you know again as mister graham said you know the short term the market's a voting machine you have a bunch of lemmings voting one direction that's concerning but if it's a great business that doesn't have a lot of debt and people can just listen to more music next year than this year you know you're gonna do well so it's a bit some combination of being personally secure and also just knowing what you own and over time you build calluses i would say so psychologically just as a human being speaking of lions and gazelles and all this kind of stuff yeah is there some is it as simple as just being financially secure is there some just human qualities that you have to be born with slash develop i think so i think now i'm a pretty emotional person i would say or i feel pretty strong emotions but not in investing i'm remarkably immune to kind of volatility and that's a big advantage and it took some time for me to develop that so you weren't born with that you think no so being emotional do you want to respond to volatility yeah and you just it's a bit again i you can learn a lot from other people's experience it's one of the few businesses where you can learn an enormous amount by reading about other periods in history you know watch you know following buffett's career the mistakes he made if you're investing a lot of capital every one of your mistakes can be big mhmm right so we've made big mistakes the good news is that the vast majority of things we've done have worked out really well and so that also gives you you know confidence over time but because we make very few investments you know we own eight things today or seven companies of that matter if we get one wrong it's going to be big news and so the other nature of our business you have to be comfortable with is a lot of public scrutiny a lot of public criticism and that requires some experience i'm calling that i think we'll talk about some of that yeah financially secure is something you i believe also recommend for even just everyday investors is there some general advice from the things you've been talking about that applies to everyday investors sure so never invest money you can't afford to lose where it would if you lost this this money and you know you lose your house etcetera so having being in a place where you're investing money that you don't care about the price in the short term you know it's money for your retirement and you take a really long term view i think that's key never investing where you borrow money against your securities you know the markets offer you the opportunity to leverage your investment and in most worlds you'll be okay except if you know there's a financial crisis or you know a nuclear device gets detonated god forbid somewhere in the world or there's a unexpected war or you know someone kills a leader unexpectedly you know things happen that can change the course of history and markets react very negatively to those kinds of events and you you can own the greatest business in the world trading for a hundred dollars a share and next moment it could be fifty so as long as you don't borrow against securities you own really high quality businesses and and it's not money that you need in the short term then you can you can actually be thoughtful about it and that is a huge advantage the vast majority of investors it seems tend to be the ones that panic and the downturns get over related and when markets are doing well so be able to think long term and be sufficiently financially secure such that you can afford to think long term yep buffett is the ultimate long term thinker and just the decisions he makes the consistency of decisions he's made over time and fitting into that sort of long term framework is a very very educational let's put it that way for the for learning about this business so you mentioned eight companies but what do you think about mutual funds that are for everyday investors that diversify across a larger number of companies i think there are very few mutual funds there are thousands and thousands of mutual funds there are very few that earn their keep in terms of the fees they charge they tend to be too diversified and you know too short term and you're often much better off just buying an index fund and many of them perform they look if you look carefully their portfolios are not so different from the underlying index itself and you tend to pay a much higher fee now all of that being said there's some very talented mutual fund managers a guy named will danoff at fidelity's had a great record over a long period of time you know the famous peter lynch ron baron another great long term growth stock investor so there's some great mutual funds but i put them in the handful versus the thousands and if you're in you know the thousands i'd rather someone bought just an index fund basically yeah index funds but what what would be the leap for an everyday investor to go to investing in a small number of companies like two three four five companies i even recommend for individual investors to invest in you know a dozen companies you don't get that much more benefit of diversification going from a dozen to twenty five or even fifty you know most of the benefits diversification come in the first you know call it ten or twelve and if you're investing in businesses that don't have a lot of debt they're businesses that you can understand yourself you understand you know actually individual investors did a much better job analyzing tesla than the so called professional investors or analysts the vast majority of them so if it's a business you understand if you bought a tesla you understand the product and its appeal to consumers you know it's a good place to start when you're analyzing a company so i would invest in things you can understand that's kind of a key you know you like chipotle mhmm you you understand why they're successful you can you know go there every week and you can monitor you know is anything changing you know how these new kind of house chicken al pastor is that is that a good upgrade from the basic chicken you know the drink offerings improving the store is clean i think you should invest in companies you really understand simple businesses where you can predict with a high degree of confidence what it's gonna look like over time and if you do that in a not particularly concentrated fashion and you don't borrow money against your securities you'll probably do much better than your typical mutual fund yeah it's interesting consumers that love a thing are actually good analysts of that thing or i guess a good starting point and by the way there's much more information available today when i was first investing literally we had people faxing us documents from the sec filings in washington dc now everything's available online conference call transcripts are free you know there's you have ai you know you have unlimited data and in the all kinds of message boards and reddit forums and things where people are are you know sharing advice and everyone has their own you know by virtue of their career or experience they'll they'll they'll know about an industry or a business and that gives an i would take advantage of your own competitive advantages i'm just afraid if i invest in chipotle i'll be like analyzing every little change of menu from a financial perspective and just be very critical if it's gonna expect affect your experience i wouldn't i wouldn't buy the stock yeah i mean i i should also say that i am somebody that emotionally does respond to volatility which is why i've never bought index funds and i just i just noticed myself psychologically being affected by the ups and downs of the market i wanna tune out mhmm because if i'm at all tuned in it has a negative impact on my life yeah that's really important can you explain what activist investing is you've been talking about investing and then looking at companies when they're struggling stepping in and reconfiguring things within that company and helping it become great so that's part of it but let's just zoom out what what what's this idea of activist investing i think recently in the last couple of days i read an article saying that more than fifty percent of the capital in the world today that's in invested in the stock markets passive index money and that's the most passive form right so if you think about an index fund a machine buys a fixed set of securities in certain proportion there's no human judgment at all and there's no real person behind it in a way they never take steps to improve a business they just quietly own securities what we do is we invest our capital in a handful of things we get to know them really really well because you're gonna put twenty percent of your assets in something you need to know it really well but once you become a big holder and if you've got some thoughts on how to make a business more valuable you can do more than just be a passive investor so our strategy is built upon finding great companies in some cases that have lost their way and then helping them succeed and we can do that with ideas from outside the boardroom sometimes we take a seat on a board or more than one and we work with the best management teams in the world to help these businesses succeed so when i first went into this business no one knew who we were and we didn't have that much money and so to influence what was to us a big company we had to make a fair bit more noise right so we would buy a stake we'd announce it publicly we'd attempt to engage with management the first activist investment we made at pershing square was wendy's i couldn't get the ceo to ever return my call he didn't return my call so we actually in that case our idea was wendy's owned a company called tim hortons which was this coffee donut chain and you could buy wendy's for basically five billion dollars and they owned a hundred percent of tim hortons which itself was worth more than five billion so you could literally buy wendy's separate tim hortons and get wendy's for negative value that seemed like a pretty good opportunity even though the business wasn't doing that well so we bought the stake called the ceo couldn't get a meeting nothing so we hired actually blackstone which was at that time had an investment bank and we hired them to do what's called a fairness opinion of what wendy's would be worth if they followed our advice and they agreed to do it paid them a fee for it and then we mailed in a letter with a copy of the fairness opinion saying wendy's would basically be worth eighty percent more if they did what we said and six weeks later they did what we said so that's activism at least an early form of activism with that kind of under our belt we had a little more credibility and now we started to take things and stakes in companies the media would pay attention so the media became kind of an important partner and you know some combination of shame embarrassment and opportunity motivated management teams to do the right thing and then you know beyond that there's certain steps you can take if management's recalcitrant and the shareholders are on your side but it's a bit like running for office you've got to get all the constituents to support you and your ideas and if they support you and your ideas you can overthrow if you will the board of a company you bring in new talent and then take over the management of a business and that's the most extreme form of activism so that's kind of the early days of what we did and a lot of the early things that we did were you know call it what we call sort of like investment banking activism where we'd go in and recommend something a good investment bank would have recommended and if they do it we make a bunch of money and then we moved on to the next one and then we realized an investment a company called general growth was the first time we took a board seat on the company and there was some financial restructuring and also an opportunity to improve the operations of the business sit on the board of a company and that was one of the best investments we ever made and we said okay we can do more than just be an outside the boardroom investor and we can get involved in helping select the right management teams and helping guide the right management teams and then we've done that over years and then i would say the last seven years we haven't had to be an activist an activist is generally someone who's outside banging on the door trying to get in we're sort of built enough credibility that they open the door and they say hey bill what ideas do you have so welcome would you like to join the board we're treated differently today than we were in the beginning and that is this i would say some people might just call it being an engaged owner that by the way that's the way investing was done in the andrew carnegie jp morgan days you know one hundred and fifty years ago right you had these iconic business leaders that would own twenty percent of us steel and when things would go wrong they've replaced the board and the management and fixed them and over time we went to a world where mutual funds were created like in the 1920s 30s index funds with vanguard and others and that all these controlling shareholders would you know kind of gave their stock to society or their children and multiple generations and there were no longer kind of controlling owners of businesses or very few and that led to underperformance and the opportunity for activists over time and what activism has done and i think we've helped lead this movement is it restored kind of the balance of power between the owners of the business and the managements of the company and that's been a very good thing for the performance of the of the us stock market actually so the owners meaning the shareholders yes and so there's a more direct channel communication with with activist investing between the shareholders and the people running the company yes so activists generally never own more than five or ten percent of a business so they don't have control so the way they get influence is they have to convince the other you know but they have to get to the sort of majority of the other shareholders to support them and if they can get that kind of support they can behave almost like a controlling shareholder and that's how it works so the running of companies according to bill ackman is more democratic now it is it is but you need some thought leaders so activists are kind of thought leaders because they can spend the time and the money you know a retail investor that owns a thousand shares isn't doesn't have the the the resources or the time they got a day job whereas an activist day job is finding the handful of things where there are opportunities so on average is it good to have such an engaged powerful influential investor helping controlled direct the direction of a company depends who that investor is but generally i think it's a good thing and that's why you know one of the problems with being ceo of a company today and having a very diversified shareholder base is the kind of short term long term balance and you have investors who have all different interests in terms of what they wanna achieve and when they want it achieved and ceo of a new company has not a new ceo of an old company let's say hasn't had the chance to develop the credibility to make the kind of longer term decisions and can be stuck in a cycle of being judged on a quarterly basis and a business the best businesses are forever assets and decisions you make now have impact three four five years from now in order to make and sometimes there are decisions we make that have the effect of of reducing the earnings of a company in the short term because in the long term it's gonna make the business much more valuable but it's sometimes it's hard to have that kind of credibility when you're a new ceo of a company so when you have a major owner that's respected by other shareholders sitting on the board saying hey the ceo is doing the right thing and making this expensive investment in a new factory we're spending more money on r and d because we're developing something that's going to pay off over time that large owner on the board can help buy the time necessary for management to behave in a longer term way and that's i think good for all the shareholders so that's the good story but can it get bad can you have a a ceo who is a visionary and sees the long term future of a company and an investor come in and have very selfish interest in just making more money in the short term and therefore destroy and and manipulate the opinions of the shareholders and other people on the board in order to sink the company maybe increase the increase the price but destroy the possibility of long term value it could theoretically happen but again the the activist in your example generally doesn't own a lot of stock the shareholder basis today the biggest shareholders are these index funds that are forever right the blackrock vanguard state street their ownership stakes are just at this point only growing because of the inflows of capital they have from shareholders so they have to think or they should think very long term and they're gonna be very skeptical of someone coming in with a short term idea that drives the stock price up you know in the next six months but impairs the company's long term ability to compete and basically that ownership group prevents this kind of activity from really happening so people are generally skeptical of short term activist investors yes i they're very and they're very few i don't really know any short term activist investors that's a whole point ones with credibility you mentioned general growth i read somewhere called arguably one of the best hedge fund trades of all time so i guess it went from sixty million dollars to over three billion it was it was a good one alright but it wasn't a trade i wouldn't describe it as a trade a trade is something you buy and you just flip this is something where we made the investment initially in november of two thousand eight and we still own a company we spun off of general growth and it's now fifteen years later so can can you describe what went into making that decision to actually increasing the value of the company sure so this was at the time of the financial crisis circa november two thousand and eight what real estate's always been a kind of sector that i've been interested in i began my career in the real estate business working for my dad actually arranging mortgages for real estate developers so i i have kind of deep deep ties and interest in the business and general growth was the second largest shopping mall company in the country simon properties many people have heard of general growth was number two they own some of the best malls in the country and at that time people thought of shopping malls as these non disruptable things again we talk about disruption malls have been disrupted in many ways and general growth stock the general growth the company the cfo in particular was very aggressive in the way that he borrowed money and he borrowed money from us kind of wall street not long term mortgages but generally relatively short term mortgages it was pretty aggressive as the value went up you'd borrow more and more against the assets and that helped the short term results of the business the problem was during the financial crisis the the market for what's called cmbs commercial mortgage backed securities basically shut mhmm and the company because its debt was relatively short term had a lot of big maturities coming up that they had no ability to refinance and the market said oh my god the lenders are gonna foreclose and the shareholders are gonna get wiped becomes gonna go bankrupt they're gonna get wiped out the stock went from sixty three dollars a share to thirty four cents so and there was a family the buck bound family owned i think about twenty five percent of the company and the they had a five billion dollar five billion of stock that was worth twenty five billion or something by the time we bought a stake in the business and what interested me was i thought the assets were worth substantially more than the liabilities the company had twenty seven billion of debt and had a hundred million dollar value of the equity down from like twenty billion okay and one that you know sort of an interesting place to start with a stock down ninety nine percent but the fundamental drivers of the mall business are occupancy how occupied are the malls occupancy was up year on year between o seven and o eight interestingly net operating income which is kind of a measure of cash flow from the malls that was up year on year so kind of the underlying fundamentals were doing fine the only problem they had is they had billions of dollars of debt that they had to repay they couldn't repay and if you kind of examine the bankruptcy code that it's precisely designed for a situation like this where it's kind of this resting place you can go to kind of re restructure your business now the problem was that every other company that had gone bankrupt the shareholders got wiped out and so the market seeing every previous example the shareholders get wiped out the assumption is the stock is gonna go to zero but that's not what the bankruptcy code says the bankruptcy bankruptcy code says is that the value gets apportioned based on value and if you could prove to a judge that there was the assets worth more than the liabilities then the shareholders actually get to keep their investment in the company and that was the bet we made and and so we stepped into the market and we bought twenty five percent of the company in the open market for we had to pay up it started out at thirty four cents i think there were three hundred million shares so it was at a hundred million dollar value by the time we were done we paid an average of we paid sixty million for twenty five percent of the business so about two hundred and forty million dollars for the equity of the company and then we had to get on the board to convince the director of the right thing to do and the board was in complete panic didn't know what to do spending a ton of money on advisors and you know i was a shareholder activist you know four years into pershing square and no one had any idea what we were doing they thought we were crazy everyday stocks everyday we'd go into the market and we'd buy this penny stock and we'd file what's called a thirteen d at every one percent increase in our stake and people just thought we were crazy we're buying stock in a company that's going to go bankrupt bill you're going to lose all your money you know run okay and i said well wait you know bankruptcy code says that it was more asset value than liabilities we should be fine and the key moment if you're looking for fun moments is there's a woman named maddie bucksbaum who was from the bucksbaum family and her cousin john was chairman of the board ceo of the company and i said as she calls me after we disclose our stake in the company she's like bill yackman i'm really glad to see you here and i met her like i don't think it was a date but i kind of met her in a social context when i was like twenty five or something and she said look i'm really glad to see you here and if there's anything i can do to help you call me i said sure we kept trying to get on the board of the company they wouldn't invite us on couldn't really run a proxy contest you know not with a company going bankrupt and their advisors actually were goldman sachs and they're like you don't want the fox in the hen house mhmm and they were listening to their advisors so i called maddie up and i said maddie i need to get on the board of the company to help and she says you know what i will call my cousin and i'll get it done mhmm like you know she calls back a few hours later you'll be going on to the board i don't know what she said to her cousin well she was convincing next thing you know i'm invited to on the board of the company and the board is talking about the old equity of general growth old equity is what you talk about that the shareholders are getting wiped out i said no no no this board represents the current equity of the company and i'm a major shareholder john's a major shareholder there's plenty of asset value here this company should be able to be restructured for the benefit of shareholders and we led a restructuring for the benefit of shareholders and it took let's say eight months and the company emerged from chapter eleven we made an incremental investment into the company and the shareholders kept the vast majority of their investment all the creditors got their you know face amount of their investment par plus accrued interest and it was a great outcome all the employees kept their jobs the mall stayed open there's no liquidation the bankruptcy system worked the way it should you know i was in court you know all the time and the first meeting with the judge the judge is like look this would never have happened were it not for a financial crisis and once the judge said i knew we were gonna be fine because the company had really not done anything fundamentally wrong maybe a little too aggressive in how they borrowed money and stock went from thirty four cents to thirty one dollars a share and actually fun little anecdote we made a lot of people a lot of money who followed us into it i got a lot of nice thank you notes which you get on occasion in this business believe it or not and then one day i get a voicemail this is when there was something called voicemail mhmm probably a few years later and it's a guy with a very thick jamaican accent leaving a message for bill ackman so you know i return all my calls call the guy back he's like hi it's bill ackman i'm just returning your call he says oh mr ackman thank you so much for calling me i said oh how can i help he says i wanted to thank you i said what do you mean he said i saw you on cnbc you know a couple years ago and you were talking about this general growth and the stock i said where was the stock at the time he said it's sixty cents or something like this and i bought a lot of stock and i'm like well how much did you invest oh i invest all of my money in the company and he was a new york city taxi driver and he invested like fifty thousand dollars or something like this at sixty cents a share and he was still holding it and he went into retirement and he made you know fifty times his money and you know those are the moments that you feel pretty good about investing what gave you confidence through that went to penny stock and i'm sure you were getting a lot of naysayers and people saying that this is crazy it's the same thing you just do the work like we got a lot of pushback from our investors actually because we had never invested in a bankrupt company before it's a field called distressed investing and and they're dedicated distressed investors and we weren't considered one of them so bill what are you doing you don't know anything about distressed investing you don't know anything about bankruptcy investing but i can read and i can and you learned and i learned and it sometimes is very helpful not to be a practitioner an expert in something because you get used to the conventional wisdom and so we just you know abstractly read the step back and look at the facts and and it was just a really interesting setup for one of the best investments we ever made how hard is it to learn some of the legal aspects of this like you mentioned bankruptcy code like i imagine it's very sort of dense language and dense ideas and all the loopholes and all that kind of stuff like if you're just stepping in and you've never done distressed investing how hard is it to figure out it's not that hard no it's not that hard okay i mean i literally read a book on distressed investing okay ben branch or something something on distressed invest this is so you're able to pick up the intuition from that just all the the basic skills involved the basic facts to know all that kind of stuff most of the world's knowledge has already been written somewhere you just gotta read the right books and also had great lawyers you know built up some great relationships we we work with sullivan and cromwell and their lawyer there named joe schenker who i met earlier in my career pershing square is actually my second act in the hedge fund business i started a fund called gotham partners when i was twenty six one of my early investments was a company called rockefeller center properties that was heading for bankruptcy and the lawyer on the other side representing goldman sachs was a guy named joe schenker so he was like an obvious phone call because we had yet another real estate bankruptcy we did very well but i missed the big opportunity and i suffered severe psychological torture every time i walked by rockwell center because we could have made we knew more about that property than anyone else but i knew less about deal making and didn't have the resources and i was twenty eight years old or twenty seven and they hired a better lawyer than we did and they outsmarted us on that one in a way so i said okay i'm gonna go hire this guy the next time around so okay we'll we'll we'll probably talk about rockefeller center and some failures but first you said fox in the hen house yes something that the board and the chairman were worried about why would they call you a fox so you you keep saying activist investing is is nothing to worry about it's always good sure mostly good but you know that expression applied in this context you know they were still worried about that sure and so may i mean there's a million questions here but first of all what is the process of getting on the board look like so a board can always admit a member at any time in their discretion for a us company in that maybe there's some jurisdiction where you need a shareholder vote but in most cases a board can vote on any director that they want if the board doesn't invite you to the party you have to apply to be a member in effect and that process is called you know basically is this the process of ultimately running a a slate for a meeting where you propose a number every any shareholder can propose to be on a board of a company if they own one share of stock in the business and getting your name in the company's you know the materials they sent to shareholders those rules were written in a way that were very unfavorable very difficult to get in the door and those rules have been changed very recently where the company now has to include a candidate really all the candidates in the materials they send to shareholders so the shareholders pick the best ones when we applied or we applied when we ran proxy contest in the past that was not the case and so you have to spend a lot of money mostly mailing fees and all kinds of other legal and other expenses to to let everyone know you're running like running a political campaign and then you gotta run around and meet with the big shareholders you know fly around the country explain your case to them and then there's a a shareholder meeting and if you get a majority of the votes you get on what's this proxy contest slash battle idea what's what's what's the the battle comes when they don't want you going okay and a lot of that has to do with i would say pride normal human kind of stuff you know a lot of times a board of an underperforming company doesn't want to admit that they've underperformed and boards of directors twenty years ago when we started pershing square were pretty cushy jobs sitting on a board of a company you play golf with the ceo you know at nice golf courses you make a few hundred thousand dollars a year to go to four meetings it was kind of a rubber stamp world where boards you know at the end of the day they the ceo really ran the show once shareholders could actually dislodge board members and they could lose their seats and that's really the rise of shareholder activism boards started taking their responsibilities much more seriously because directors are typically you know there are many cases they're retired ceos this is kind of how they're making a living in the later part of their career they're sit on four boards they collect a you know million a million and a half dollars a year in director's fees if they get thrown off the board by the shareholders that's embarrassing obviously and it affects their ability to get on other boards so you know again incentives as i said earlier drive all human behavior at the incentives directors are they wanna preserve their board seats so if you have a director now the directors on board serve in various roles the most vulnerable ones are ones who for example chair a compensation committee and if they put in a bad plan or they overpaid management you know they're subject to attack by shareholders but you know these contests are not dissimilar to political contests where it's mudslinging and other side puts out false information about you you have to respond and they're spending the shareholders money so they have sort of unlimited resources and you're spending your and your investors money you know when you're a small firm finite resources so they can outspend you they can sue you they can try to you know jigger the the mechanics in such a way that you're gonna lose there's some unfortunate stuff that's happened in the past you know some manipulative stuff so also some stuff that's public like in the press and all this kind of stuff oh of course you know there'd be you know articles about campbell you know the dirty days where they would go through your trash and you know make sure that you know you're not sleeping around and you know things like this but that's okay i i i can i'm subject i can survive extreme scrutiny because i've been through this for a long time so you're saying the fat and happy hens can get very wolf like when the fox is trying to break in is this how we extend the well the fox is a threat to the hens yeah yeah but but you're you've just cares the charismatic fox just explained to me why the fox is good for everybody in the hen house at the end of the day it's actually very good on a board to have someone you know if you there are many examples over time and some handful of high profile ones where the board fought tooth and nail to keep the activists off the board and then once the activists got on the board and they said you know the guy's not so bad after all the shareholders voted them on he's got some decent ideas and let's all work together to have this work out and so there are very few cases where after the contest when the by the way sometimes you have to replace the entire board we've done that but some in most cases you got a couple of seats on the board and it's just you know you want to build a board comprised of diverse points of view and that's how you get to the truth what was the most dramatic battle for the board that you have been a part of the canadian pacific proxy contest so canadian pacific was like considered the most iconic company in canada it literally built the country because the the rail that got built over the over canada is what united the various provinces into a country and and then over time because the railroad business is pretty good business they built a ton of hotels they owned a lot of real estate and it became this massive conglomerate but it was horribly mismanaged for decades by the time we got involved it was by far the worst run railroad in north america they had the lowest profit margins they had the lowest growth rate every quarter management would make excuses generally about the weather as to why they underperformed versus and there there's a direct competitor a company called canadian national as a rail goes right across the country and canadian pacific would constantly be complaining about the weather basically you know same country same regions tracks weren't that far apart and but it was a really important company and being on this board was like an honorary thing and everyone on the board was an icon of canada you know the chairman of the royal bank of canada you know the head of the most important grain privately held grain company the you know sort of an important collection of you know big time canadian executives here we were you know this is probably about thirteen years ago and you know still maybe forty four year old from new york not canadian basically saying this is the worst run railroad in north america and we bought twelve percent of the railroad at a really low price and we brought with us to our first meeting the greatest railroader ever a guy named hunter harrison who had turned around canadian national so we'd like okay we've got a great asset we've got the greatest railroad ceo of all time he's come out of retirement to step in and run the railroad and we brought him to the first meeting and they wouldn't even meet with him and and they wouldn't certainly weren't gonna consider hiring him and that led us to a proxy contest and this is where the the engine starts churning to to figure out how this contest can be won so what what's involved in well the key is we had to one come up with a group of directors who would be willing to step into a battle and we didn't want a bunch of new york directors or even american directors we wanted canadians the problem was this was the most iconic company in canada and we wanted high profile people so we talked to all the high profile people in canada every one of them would say bill you're entirely right this thing is the worst road it needs to be fixed but you know i see john at the club you know i see him at the toronto club you know i can't you know i can't do this but you're totally right and we had to and that was the concern because we're you have to file your materials by a certain day you gotta put together a slate we needed a big slate because we knew that we had to replace basically all the directors and then one i spoke to a guy who was one of the wealthiest guys in canada who was on the board at one point in time and he said bill i have an idea for you there's this woman rebecca mcdonald why don't you give her a call and i called rebecca and she was the first woman to take a company public in canada as ceo and she was a kind of anti establishment not afraid to take on anything kind of person and i called her we had a great conversation and she she was in the dominican republic at her house and i flew down to see her and she said yeah i'm all in and actually once we got her that enabled us to get others and then we put together our slate and we had some pretty interesting dialogue with the company they tried to embarrass us all the time in the press publicly what what do we press publicly you know at one point i wrote an email saying look let's come to peace on this thing but if we don't you're you're really forcing my hand and we're gonna have to rent the largest hall in toronto and invite all the shareholders and it's gonna be embarrassing for management and i made reference to some nuclear winter let's not have it be a nuclear winter and they thought they'd embarrassed me by releasing the email but it only inspired us and we rented the largest hall in canada and we put up a presentation walking through you know here's canadian national here's canadian pacific here's what they said here's what they did and then we had hunter get up it was this incredibly charismatic guy from tennessee an amazing you know he's like a lion okay incredibly deep voice unbelievable track record incredibly respected guy it's like getting michael jordan to come out of retirement and and come run the company and he hunter was incredible and other paul hall other members of my team were you know super engaged and the board you know canadians are known to be nice so one of the problems we had is shareholders would never tell management or the board that they were losing it was not until the night before the meeting when the vote came in the management realized that they lost we got ninety nine percent of the vote and they offered us a deal when they begged us to take a deal they said look we'll resign tonight so that we don't have to come to the meeting tomorrow that's how embarrassed they were that that was kind of a interesting one so for in both this proxy battle and the company itself this was one of your more successful investments it was i mean the stock's up about ten times and it's an industrial company it's a railroad it's not like a growth like it's not google so it's a great story and and the company's now run by a guy named keith creel and keith it was hunter's protege and in so many ways he's actually better than hunter he's doing an incredible job and we're the sad part here is we made it we did very well we tripled our money over several years and then i went through a very challenging period because of a couple bad investments and we had to sell our canadian pacific to pay to raise capital to pay for investors who were who were leaving but we had another opportunity to buy it back last in the last couple of years and so we're we're now again a major owner of the company but had we held onto original stock it would have been epic if you will so on this one you were right yes and i i i read an article about you and there's many articles about you i i read an article that said bill is often right but you approach it with a scorched earth approach that can often do more sort of can do damage i haven't read the often right article but the good news is we are often right and i say we because we're a team mhmm small team but a but a but a fortunately very successful one you know so our batting average as investors is extremely high and the good news is our record is totally public you can see everything we've ever done but the press doesn't generally write about the success stories they write about the failures and so we've had some epic failures you know big losses good news is they've been a a tiny minority of the cases now no one likes to lose money it's even worse to lose other people's money and i've done that occasionally the good news is if you stuck with us you've done very well you know over a long time on a small tangent since we're talking about boards did you get a chance to see what happened with the openai board because i'm talking to sam altman soon is there any insight you have just maybe lessons you draw from this kind of sure these kinds of events especially with an ai technology company such dramatic things happening yeah that was an incredible story look governance really matters and the governance structure of openai i think leaves something to be desired you know i think sam's point was this and maybe musk elon musk's point originally set up as a nonprofit and reminds me actually i invested in a nonprofit run by a former facebook founder where he's gonna create a facebook like entity for nonprofits to promote you know goodness in the world and the problem was he couldn't hire the talent he wanted because he couldn't grant stock options he couldn't pay market salaries and ultimately we ended up he ended up selling the business to a for profit so it taught me for profit solutions to problems are much better than nonprofits and here you had kind of a blend right it was set up as a nonprofit but i think they found the same thing they couldn't hire the talent they wanted without having a for profit subsidiary but the nonprofit entity as i understand it owns a big chunk of openai and the investors own sort of a capped interest where their upside is capped and they don't have representation on the board and i think that's a you know was a setup for a problem and that's clearly what happened here and there's i guess some kind of complexity in the governance i mean because of this nonprofit and cap profit thing it seems like there's a bunch of complexity and nonstandard aspects to it that perhaps also contributed to the problem yeah governance really matters boards of directors really matter giving the shareholders the right to have input at least once a year on the structure of the governance of companies is is really important and private you know venture back boards are also not ideal you know i'm an active investor in ventures and you know there are some complicated issues that emerge in private as sort of venture stage companies where board members have somewhat divergent incentives from you know the long term owners of a business and what you see a lot in venture boards is you know they're presided over generally by you know venture capital investors who are big investors in the company and oftentimes it's more important to them to give the to have the public perception that they're good directors so they get the next best deal right if they get a you know if they have a reputation for kind of taking on management too aggressively word will get out in the small community of founders and they'll miss the next google and so they their interests are not just in that particular company that's also you know one of the problems again it all comes comes back to incentives can you explain to me the difference you know venture backed like vcs and shareholders so this means before the company goes public yeah so private venture backed companies the boards tend to be very small could be a handful of the venture investors and management they're often very rarely independent directors it's just not an ideal structure oh i see you want independent it's beneficial to have people who have an economic interest in the business and they care only about the success of that company as opposed to someone who you know if you think about the venture business getting into the best deals is more important than any one deal and you see cases where you know the boards go along with in some sense cases bad behavior on the part of management because they want a reputation for being kind of a a founder friendly director you know that's that's kind of problematic you don't have the same issue in public company boards so we talked about some of some of the big wins and your track record but you said there were some big losses so what what what's what's the biggest loss of your career biggest loss of my career is a company called valiant pharmaceuticals we made an investment in business that didn't meet our core principles problem in the pharmaceutical industry and there are many problems as i've learned is it's a very volatile business right it's based on drug discovery it's based on you know predicting the kind of the future revenues of a drug before it goes off patent you know lots of complexities and we thought we had founded a a pharmaceutical company we could own because of a very unusual founder in the way he approached this business we it was a company where another activist was on the board of directors of the company and kind of governing and overseeing the day to day decisions and we ended up making a passive investment in the company and up until this point in time we really didn't make passive investments and the company made a series of decisions that were you know disastrous and then we stepped in to try to solve the problem it was the first time i ever joined a board and the mess was much larger than i realized from the outside and then i was kind of stuck and it was very much a confidence sensitive strategy because they they built their business by acquiring pharmaceutical assets and they often issued stock when they acquired targets and so once the market lost confidence in management the stock price got crushed and it impaired their ability to continue to acquire low costs you know drugs and we lost four billion dollars four billion dollars yeah how's that for a big loss that's it's up there so i'm sweating this whole conversation both the wins and the losses and the stakes involved and by the way that that loss catalyzed other what i call mark to market losses so very high profile huge number disastrous press then people said okay bill's gonna go out of business so we're gonna bet against everything he's doing and we know his entire portfolio because we only own ten things and we were short a company called herbalife very famously we've only really shorted two companies the first one there's a book the second one there's a movie okay we no longer short companies but so people pushed up the price of herbalife which is when you're a short seller that's catastrophic i can explain that and then they also shorted the other stocks that we owned and so that valiant loss led to an overall more than thirty percent loss in the value of our portfolio the valiant loss was real and was crystallized we end up selling the position taking that loss most of the other losses were what i would call mark to market losses that were temporary but many people go out of business because as i mentioned before large move in a price if investors are redeeming or you have leverage you know can put you out of business and if if people assumed if we got put out of business we'd have to sell everything or cover our short position and that would make the losses even worse so wall street is kinda ruthless so they can make money off of that whole thing absolutely so they use the opportunity of valiant to try to destroy you yes reputation financially and then capitalize and they yes make money off of that yes well that's a terrifying spot to be in what what was the light going through that that was pretty grim it was it's actually much worse than that because i had a lot of stuff going on personally as well so and these things tend to be correlated the valiant mistake came at a time where i was contemplating my marriage and i was also you know the problem with the hedge fund business is when you get to a certain scale the ceo becomes like the chief marketing officer of the business and i'm really an investor as opposed to a marketing guy but when you have investors who give you a few hundred million dollars they wanna see you you know once a year bill i'd love to see you for an hour but if you got a couple hundred of those you find yourself on a plane to the middle east to asia flying around the country this is pre zoom and that takes you away from the investment process you have to delegate more that was a contributor to the valiant mistake so now we lose a ton of money on voliant my ex wife and i were you know talking about separating getting divorced i put that on hold so you know i didn't wanna make a decision in the middle of this crisis and things just keep getting worse we were also sued when you lose a lot of money we didn't get sued by our investors but we got sued by a shareholder because when the stock price goes down shareholders sue we've done nothing wrong other than make a big mistake but you know so you have litigation your investors are taking their money out i'm in the middle of a divorce the divorce starts to proceed my my ex wife's lawyer's expectations of what my net worth was was about three times what it actually was and it was going lower right in the middle of this and i i remember the lawyer saying look bill you know you know vestimate your net worth at x but don't worry we only want a third but x was three x so a third was a hundred percent and and then we had i had litigation and actually never before publicly disclosed and i'll share it with you now we had a public company that owned about a third of our portfolio that was called our version of berkshire hathaway i tried to you know learn from mister buffett over time and it was so to speak permanent capital the beauty of problem with hedge funds is people can take their money out every quarter what buffett has is a company where people wanna take their money out they sell the stock but the money stays so we set up a similar structure in october of two thousand fourteen and then a year later valiant happens and then a year later we're in the middle of the mess and we're still in the mess you know like by kind of mid two thousand seventeen we've got a litigation underway and another activist investor a firm called elodie associates which is run by a guy named paul singer took a big position in our public company that was the bulk of our capital and they shorted all the stocks that we owned and they went long the short probably went long the short that we were short and they were making a bet that we'd be forced to liquidate and then they would make money on you know our public company was trading at a discount to where all the securities were so they bought the they bought the public company they shorted the securities and then they you know came to see us and to try to you know be activists and force us to liquidate and that's sort of woah so i thought this was gonna be wow i would i envision an end where the divorce takes all of my resources the permanent capital vehicle ends up getting liquidated and another activist in my industry puts me out of business and i had met neri oxman right around this time and i'd fallen completely in love with her and i was envisioning a world where i was bankrupt a judge found me guilty of you know whatever you know he sends me off to jail or not that judge because he was a civil judge but another judge sues the sec department of justice and i find myself in this incredible mess and i decided i didn't want things to end that way so i i did something i'd never done before i talked all before about you don't borrow money i borrowed money and i borrowed three hundred million dollars from jp morgan in the middle of this mess and i give jp morgan enormous credit in seeing through it and also you know i had been a a good client over a long period of time and it's like you know it's a handshake bank and they bet that i would succeed and i took that money to buy enough stock in my public company that could prevent an activist from taking over and effectively buy control of our little public company and i got that done and that i knew was the moment the turning point and i resolved my divorce and divorces get easier to resolve when things are going badly i was able to resolve that we settled the litigation i was buying blocks of our stock in the market i remember a day i bought a big block of stock in the market i got a call from gordon singer who is paul singer's son who runs their london part of their business and he's like bill was that you buying that block i said yes and he's like fuck so he knew he knew that once i got that they were not gonna be able to succeed and they went away and that that was the bottom and i i we've had an incredible run since then and there you were able to protect your reputation from the valiant failure still i mean you know this is a business where you're gonna make some mistakes it was a big one it was very reputationally damaging the press was a total disaster but i'm not a quitter and actually the the key moments for us we'd never taken our core investment principles and actually really written them down something we talked about at meetings investor you know kind of our investment team meetings i had a member of the team i said look go find a big piece of granite and a chisel and let's take those core principles i want them like moses's ten commandments okay we're gonna chisel them then we're gonna put it up on the wall and once we produce those we put one on everyone's desk i said look if we ever again veer from the core principles you know it hit me with a baseball bat yeah and that was the bottom and ever since then we've done we've had the best six years in the history of the firm so refocus on the fundamentals that and love helps the story love helps i i literally met nary at the absolute bottom our first date was september seventh of two thousand seventeen that was very close to the bottom actually there's one other element to the story so this went on for a few months after i met her the other element is that one day i go got a call from mary she's like bill guess what i'm like what brad pitt is coming to the media lab he wants to see my work i'm like that's beautiful sweetheart i didn't know brad pitt was interested in in your work as a man that's a difficult phone call to take and apparently he's really interested in architecture okay now nara and i were like you know we would whatsapp all day every day we'd talk throughout the day brad pitt shows up at the media lab at ten o'clock i you know talk to her in the morning i kinda text her to see how things are going don't hear back and on whatsapp you can see like whether the other person's read it or not k yeah no response yeah a couple hours later send another text no response six o'clock no response eight o'clock no response ten o'clock no response and you know yeah she finally calls me at ten thirty and tells me how great yeah this so i had this scenario okay i'm gonna a judge is gonna find me we're gonna lose to the judge all my assets will disappear yeah and then brad pitt's gonna take my girlfriend yeah brad pitt's your competition this is great so it was like a moment yeah that that was sort of the bottom and then sort of you know the motivational thing i didn't wanna lose to an activist didn't wanna lose my girl to some other guy so brad pitt and you emerge from all that the winner on all fronts i'm a very fortunate guy very fortunate and lucky you talked about some of the technical aspects of that but psychologically just is there like what are you doing at night by yourself that was a hard time hard time because i was separated from my wife and my kids i was living in you know not the greatest department you know i'm you know i had a beautiful home and so i had to go find like a bachelor place and i was i didn't wanna be away from my kids i moved like ten blocks away and i wasn't seeing them and they didn't like it so i ended up buying an apartment i didn't like in the same building as my kids like with a different different entrance so i could be near them but i was home alone i got a dog that was a a bar we call him babar not the elephant he's a black labradoodle nice he was supposed to be a mini but he's not so as mini but i got him at six weeks old and he would keep me company and i started meditating actually and a friend recommended tm and i would meditate twenty minutes in the morning twenty minutes in the evening and i also big believer in exercise and you know weight lifting and i play tennis and i've i had been this is not my first you know proximity to disaster i had another moment in my career like you know two thousand two and i learned this method for dealing with these kind of moments which is you just make a little progress every day so today i'm gonna wake up i'm gonna make progress you know i'll make progress in litigation i'll make progress in the portfolio i'll make progress with my life and progress compounds a bit like money compounds you don't see a lot of progress in the first few weeks but like thirty days in like oh okay you know like you can't look up at the mountaintop where you used to be because then you'll give up right but you're just okay just make step by step by step and then ninety days in you're like okay i was way down there okay i'm not the mountain okay i don't look up just keep making you know progress progress progress and progress really does compound and one day you wake up and like wow it's amazing how far i've come and if you look at a chart of pershing square our company you can see the absolute bottom you can see where we were you can see the drop and you can see where we are now and that huge drop that felt like complete unbelievable disaster looks like a little bump on the curve and it really gives you perspective on these things you just have to power through and i think the key is you know i've always been fortunate like from a mental health point of view and you know nutrition sleep exercise and a little progress every day it's you know very that's it and you know good friends and family you know i had you know go take a walk with a friend every night you know and a sister who loves me and parents who are supportive but they were you know they were all worried about their their son their brother you know it was it was a moment and also by the way the other thing to think about is when you recover from something like this you really appreciate it you know and and also the you know as much as the the media loves okay when some successful person falls they love writing the story of success they love even more the story of failure but when you recover from that it's kind of like the american story yeah right you know america you think of the great entrepreneurs and how many failures they had before they succeeded you know how many rocket launches you know did spacex have explode on the pad right and then you look at success i mean that's why musk is so admired you mentioned herbalife can you take me through the saga of that it's historic so we at pershing square shorted very few stocks and the reason for that is short selling is just inherently treacherous so if you buy a stock it's called going long right you're buying something your worst case scenario is you lose your whole investment you buy a stock for one hundred it goes to zero you lose one hundred dollars right per share you buy one share you lose one hundred you short a stock at one hundred what it means is you borrow the security from someone else the analogy i gave that made it easy for people to understand it's a bit like you think you know silver coins are gonna go down in value and you have a friend who's got a whole pile of these eighteen eighty silver silver us dollars and you think it would go down to value you say hey can i borrow you know ten of those dollars from you he's like sure but what are you gonna pay me to borrow i'm like i'll pay if you know i'll pay you interest on your on the value of the dollars today so you borrow the dollars that are worth one hundred dollars each today you pay them interest while you're borrowing them and then you go sell them in the market for one hundred dollars that's what they're worth and then they go down in price to fifty you go back in you buy the silver dollars back at fifty dollars and you give them back to your friend your friend is fine you borrowed ten you gave him the ten back and he got interest in the meantime he's happy he made money on his coin collection you however made fifty dollars times the ten coins you made five hundred bucks that's pretty good the problem with that is what if you sell them and they go from a hundred to a thousand now you're gonna have to go buy them back and you gotta pay you know whatever ten thousand dollars to buy back coins you know that you would you sold for five hundred you're gonna lose ninety five hundred dollars and there's no limit right to how high a stock price can go companies go to three trillion dollars in value right tesla a lot of people short of tesla saying oh it's overvalued he's never gonna be able to make a successful electric car well i'm sure there are people who went bankrupt shorting tesla that's why we didn't short stocks but i was presented with this actually reporter that covered the other short investment we made early in the career a company called mbia came to me and said bill i found this incredible company you gotta take a look at it it's a total fraud and they're scamming poor people and we should say that mbia was a very successful short it was a big part of it was that we used a different kind of instrument to short it where you we reversed that sort of we made the investment asymmetric in our favor meaning put up a small amount of money if it works we make a fortune whereas short selling is you kind of sell something and you have to buy it back at a higher price herbalife didn't have the what's called credit default swaps that you could purchase not a big enough company it didn't have enough debt outstanding to be able to implement you had to short the stock in order to make it as successful to bet against the company and the more work i did in the company the more i was like oh my god this thing's an incredible scam you know that they purport to sell weight loss shakes but in reality they're selling you know kind of a fake business plan and the people that adopt it lose money and they go after poor people they go after actually in many cases undocumented immigrants who were pitched on the american dream opportunity and because they have few other options because they can't get legal employment they become herbalife distributors and it's a business where you so called multi level marketing or pure multi level marketing is sort of the name for a legitimate company like this or it's a pyramid scheme where basically your sales are really only coming from people who are you convinced to buy the product by getting them into the business that's precisely what this company is and like okay shorting a pyramid scheme seems like one we'll make a bunch of money but you know two the world will be behind us because they're harming poor people you know regulators will get interested in a company like this and we said you know the ftc is going to shut this thing down and we did a ton of work and i gave this sort of epic presentation laying out all the facts stock got completely crushed and we were on our way and the government actually got interested early on launched an investigation pretty early sec and other otherwise but then a guy named carl icahn showed up and there's we have a little bit of a backstory but his motivations here were not really principally driven by thinking herbalife was a good company he thought it was a good way to hurt me so he he basically bought a bunch of stock and said it was a really great company and you know carl at least at the time threw his weight around a bit he was a credible investor had a lot of resources and that began the saga so he was we should say a legendary investor himself i'd say legendary in a sense yes for sure an iconic iconic carl icahn oh that's very well done so definitely a iconic investor so what was the backstory between the two of you so i mentioned that i had another period of time where significant business challenges this was my first fund called gotham partners and we had a court stop a transaction between some private a private company we owned and a public company it's another long story if you wanna i would love i would love to hear it as well but it was really my deciding to wind up my former fund and we owned a big stake in a company called hallwood realty partners which was a company that owned real estate assets and it was worth a lot more than where it was trading but it needed an activist to really unlock the value and we were in fact going out of business and didn't have the time or the resources to pursue it so i sold it to carl icahn but and and i sold it to him at a premium to where the stock was trading i think the stock was like sixty six i sold to him for eighty but it was worth about one hundred and fifty and i said look and part of the deal was carl's like look i'll give you schmuck insurance you know i'll make you sure you don't look bad and i had another deal at a higher price without schmuck insurance but i deal with carl at a lower price for schmuck insurance and the way the schmuck insurance went he said look bill if i sell the stock in the next three years you know for a higher price i'll give you fifty percent of my profit well that's a pretty good deal so we made that deal and because i was dealing with carl icahn who had a reputation for you know being difficult i was you know very focused on the agreement and we didn't want him to be able to be cute so the agreement said if we sell if he sells or otherwise transfers his shares and i we came up with a definition to include every version of sale okay because you know it's carl well he then buys the stake and then makes a bid for the company and you know plan is for him to get the company and he bids like one hundred and twenty a share and the company hires morgan stanley to sell itself and it raises bid to one twenty five and one thirty eventually gets sold i don't remember the exact price let's say a hundred and forty five dollars a share and carl's not the winning bidder and he sells his stock or he loses or transfers his shares for a hundred forty five dollars a share so he owes actually our investors the difference between one forty five and eighty times fifty percent and i had like you know lawyers never like you to put like a arithmetic example i put like a formula you know like out of a math book in in the documents so there can be no confusion it was only an eight page really simple agreement so the deal closes and he's supposed to pay us in two business days or three business days i wait a few business days no money comes in i call carl i'm like carl congratulations on on the hollywood realty thanks bill i said oh just wanna remind you i know it's been a few years but you know you we have this agreement remember the schmuck insurance he's like yeah i said well you owe us our schmuck insurance he said what do you mean i didn't sell my shares i said do you do you still have the shares he says no i said what happened to them well the company did a merger for cash and they took away my shares but i didn't sell them you understand what happened so i had i said carl i'm gonna have to sue you i said sue me i'm gonna sue you so i sued him and the legal system in america takes can take some time and what he would do is we sued and then we won in the in the whatever new york supreme court and then he appealed and he you can appeal like six months after the case we waited till the hundred and seventy ninth day and they would appeal and then we fought at the next level and then he would appeal and he appealed all the way to the supreme court of course the supreme court wouldn't take the case it took years now we had as part of our agreement we got nine percent interest on the money that he owed us so i viewed it as my carl icahn money market account with a much higher interest rate and eventually i won what was the amount just a tiny now it was material to my investors so my first fund i wound it down but i wanted to maximize everything for my investors right these are the people who backed me at twenty six years old i was right out of business school i had no experience and they supported me so i'm going to go to the end of the earth for them and four and a half million relative to our fund at the end was maybe four hundred million so it wasn't a huge number but it was a big percentage of what was left after i sold all our liquid securities so i was fighting for it so we got four and a half million plus interest for eight years or something that's how long the litigation took so we got about double so he owed me nine million dollars which to carl icahn who had probably a twenty billion dollars net worth at the time this was nothing but to me it was like okay this is my investors money i'm gonna get it back and so you know eventually we won eventually he paid and then he called me he said bill congratulations now we can be friends and we can we can invest do some investing together i'm like carl fuck you you actually said fuck you yes i'm not that kind of person generally but you know he made eight years to pay me not me even me my investors' money they owed and so i yeah so he probably didn't like that so he kind of hung around in the weeds waiting for an opportunity and then from there i you know started pershing we had a kind of straight line up you know we were up in the first twelve years we could do nothing wrong then valiant verbal life right he sees an opportunity and he buys the stock he figures he's gonna run me off the road and so that was the beginning of that and kind of the the moment and i think it's the i'm told by cnbc it's the most watched segment in business television history mhmm they're interviewing me about the herbalife investment on cnbc and and then carl icahn calls into the show and we have kind of a interesting conversation where he calls me all kinds of names and stuff so it's it was a moment it was a moment in my life it wasn't public information that he was long on herbalife he didn't yet disclose he had a stake yeah but he was just telling me how stupid i was to be short this company so for him it wasn't about the fundamentals of the company it was about it was just personal hundred percent is there part of you that regrets saying fuck you on that phone call to carl icahn no i i generally i generally have no regrets because i'm very happy with where i am now mhmm and i feel like you know it's a bit like you know you step on the the butterfly in the forest and the world changes because you know every action has a reaction you know if you're happy with who you are where you are in life every decision you've made good or bad over the course of your life got you to precisely where you are i wouldn't change anything you said you lost money on herbalife so what so he did the long term battle what he did is he he got on the board of the company and used the company's financial resources plus his stake in the business to squeeze squeeze us and a squeeze and short selling is where you restrict the supply of the securities so that there's a scarcity and then you encourage people to buy the stock and you drive the stock up and as i explained before you're short those coins at ten they go to a hundred you can lose a theoretically an unlimited amount of money and that's scary that's why we we don't short stocks that's why i didn't short stocks before this but this was unfortunately i had to have the personal lesson so how much was for him personal versus part of sort of the game of investing well he thought he could make money doing this he wouldn't have done it if he did otherwise he thought his bully pulpit his ability to create a short squeeze his control over the company would enable him to achieve this and he made a billion we lost a billion so you think it was a financial decision not a personal it was a personal decision to pursue it but he was waiting for an opportunity where he can make money at our expense and was kind of a brilliant opportunity for him now the irony is well first of all the ftc found a few interesting facts so one the government launched an investigation they ended up settling with the company and the company paid two twenty million dollars in fines i met a professor from berkeley a couple years ago who told me that he had been hired by the government as their expert on herbalife and he got access to all their data was able to prove that they're a pyramid scheme but the government ultimately settled with karl because they were afraid they could you know they didn't they could possibly lose in court so they settled with him but if you look at the stock if we'd been able to stay short the entire time we would have made a bunch of money because the you know stock had a six billion dollar market cap and we shorted it today is probably a billion billion and a half so you left the short or whatever that's called closed covered closed it out yeah when we sold valiant we covered herbalife that was the resetting moment for the firm because it would just psychologically and you know the beauty of investing is you don't need to make it back the way you lost it right you can just take your loss by the way losses are valuable and that the government allows you to take a tax loss and that can shelter other gains and we just refocused can you say one thing you really like about carl icahn and one thing you really don't like about him sure so he's a very charming guy so in the midst of all this at the hallwood one he took me out for dinner to his favorite italian restaurant really yeah but we're in the middle of the litigation to see if he could resolve it and he offered ten million to my favorite charity the problem was that it wasn't my money it was my investors' money so i couldn't settle with him on that basis but you know i had the chance to spend real time with him at dinner he's funny he's charismatic he's got incredible stories and you know actually i made peace with him over time we had a little hug out on cnbc even had them to my house believe it or not i hosted a something called the finance cup which is a tennis tournament between people in finance in europe and the us and we had the the event at my house and one guy thought to invite carl icahn and so we had carl icahn there to present awards and again i have to say i kind of like the guy so but was i didn't like him much during this is there because at least from the outsider perspective there's a bit of a personal vengeance here or anger can build up do you ever worry the personal attacks between powerful investors can cloud your judgment what is the right financial decision i think it's possible but again i try to be extremely economically rational and actually the last seven years have been quite peaceful i really have not been an activist in the old form for many years and the vast majority of even our activist investments historically were very polite respectful cases the press of course focuses on them the more interesting ones like chipotle was one of the best investments we ever made we've you know we're we got four of eight board seats and we worked with management it was a great outcome i don't think there's ever been a story about it and the stock's up you know almost ten times from the time we hired brian nichols ceo but it's not interesting because there was no battle whereas herbalife of course was like an epic battle even canadian pacific so you know for a period there you most people when they meet me in person they're like wow bill you seem like a really nice guy i thought you know so but things have been pretty calm for the last seven years of course there's more than just the investing that your life is about especially recently let me just ask you about what's going on in the world first what was your reaction and what is your reaction and thoughts with respect to the october seventh attacks by hamas on israel you know it's a sad world that we live in that one we have terrorists and two that we can have such barbaric terrorism and you know just a reminder of that so there's several things i can ask here first on the your views on the the the prospects of the middle east but also on the reaction to this war and in the united states especially on university campuses so first let me just ask you said that you're pro palestinian can you explain what you mean by that you know with all of my posts about israel you know i'm obviously very supportive of the country of israel israel's right to exist israel's right to defend itself my arab friends my palestinian friends you know were kind of saying hey bill where are you you know what about palestinian lives and i was pretty early in my life a guy named marty peritz who's been important to me over the course of my life a professor or first investor in my fund introduced me to nari asked me when i was right out of school to join this nonprofit called the jerusalem foundation which was a charitable foundation that supported teddy kolak when he was mayor of jerusalem i ended up becoming the youngest chairman of the jerusalem foundation in my thirties and i spent some time in israel and the early philanthropic stuff i did with the drism foundation the thing i was most interested in was was kind of the palestinian the plight of the palestinians and kind of peaceful coexistence and so i had kind of an early kind of perspective and you know as chairman of the jerusalem foundation i would go into you know arab communities i would meet with families in their homes you know you get a sense of the the humanity of of a people and i care about humanity i generally take the side of people who've been disadvantaged you know almost all of our philanthropic work has been in that capacity so it's sort of my natural perspective but i don't take the side of terrorists ever obviously and yeah the whole thing is just a tragedy so to you this is about hamas not about palestine yes i mean you know the the the problem of course is when hamas controls you know for the last almost twenty years has controlled gaza you know they've including the education system they're educating you know you see these you know training videos of kindergarteners indoctrinating them into hating jews and israel so it's it's and of course you don't like to see palestinians celebrating you know some of those early videos of october seventh with you know dead bodies in the back of trucks and people you know cheering so it's it's a really unfortunate situation but i you know i think about you know a palestinian life is important and as valuable as a jewish life as a american life and you know what do people really want they want a place they want a home they wanna be able to feed their family they want a job that generates the resources to feed their family they want their kids to have a better life than they've had they want peace i think these are basic human things i'm sure the vast majority of palestinians share these views but it's such an embedded situation with hatred and as i say indoctrination and then you know going back to incentives you know terrorists generate their resources by committing terrorism and that's how they get funding and that's you know there's a lot of graft you know it's a plutocracy right the top of the terrorist pyramid you know if you accept the numbers that are in the press you know the top leaders you know have billions of dollars you know forty billion or so has gone into gaza over the last and and the west bank over the last thirty years a number like that and a lot of it's disappeared into some combination of corruption or tunnels or weapons and the tragedy is you know you look at what singapore has achieved in the last thirty years right do you think that's still possible if we look into the future of ten twenty fifty years from now yeah absolutely so not just peace but peace comes with prosperity you know people are you know under the leadership of terrorists you're not going to have prosperity and you're not going to have peace and i think the you know the israelis withdrew in two thousand five and fairly quickly hamas took control of the situation that would that should never have been allowed to happen and i think you know if you think about i had the opportunity to spend a call it an hour with henry kissinger a few months before he passed away and we were talking about gaza or in the early stage of the war he said look you know this is not you can think about gaza as the as a test of a two state solution it's not looking good these were his words so the next time around you know the palestinian people should have their own state but it can't be a state where you know forty billion resources goes in and is spent on weaponry and missiles and rockets going into israel and i do think a consortium of the gulf states you know the saudis and others have to ultimately oversee the governance of this region if i think if if that can happen i think you can have peace you can have prosperity and you know i'm fundamentally an optimist so coalition of governance governance matters you know going back to what we talked about before and the you know that that kind of approach can give the people a chance to flourish hundred percent i mean look at what dubai has accomplished with you know nomads in the desert right and that's become a major it's a tourist destination gaza could have been a a tourist destination take me through the saga of university presidents testifying on this topic on the topic of protests on college campuses protests that call for the genocide of jewish people and the university presidents maybe you could describe it more precisely but they fail to denounce the calls for genocide so it begins on october eighth probably and you can do a compare and contrast with how dartmouth managed the events of october seventh and the aftermath and how harvard did and october eighth or shortly thereafter you know the dartmouth president who had been in her job for precisely the same number of months that that the harvard president had been in her job the first thing she did is she got the most important professors of middle east studies who were arab and who were jews and they convened them and held an open session q and a for students to talk about what's going on in the middle east and began an opportunity for common understanding among the student body and dartmouth has been a relatively benign environment on this issue and students are able to do work and there aren't disruptive protests with people with bull horns walking into classrooms interfering with you know people pay today eighty two thousand dollars a year which itself is crazy to go to harvard but imagine your family borrows the money or you borrow the money as a student and your learning is disrupted by constant protests and the university has nothing you know when george floyd died know the harvard president wrote a very strong letter denouncing what had taken place and you know calling this an important moment in american history and took it incredibly seriously her first letter about october seventh was not that let's put it that way and then her second letter was not that and then ultimately you know she was sort of forced by the board or the pressure to make a more public statement but it was clear that it was hard for her to come to an understanding of this terrorist act and then the protests erupted on campus and they started out reasonably benign and then the protesters got more and more aggressive in terms of violating university rules on things like bullying and the university did nothing and that obviously for the jewish students the israeli students the israeli faculty jewish faculty created an incredibly uncomfortable environment and the presence seemed indifferent and you know i went up to campus and i met with hundreds of students in small groups and larger groups and they're like bill why is why is the president doing nothing why is the administration doing nothing and that was really the beginning and that you know i reached out to the president reached out to the board of harvard i said look this thing is headed in the wrong direction and you need to fix it and i i have some ideas love to share and i got the heisman as they say you know they just kept pushing off the opportunity for me to meet with the president and meet with the board and a certain point in time i pushed you know i'm kind of a activist when you push me it reminded me of you know like early days of activism where i couldn't get the ceo of wendy's to to return my call i couldn't get the ceo ceo of harvard you know to take a meeting and then finally i spoke to the chairman of the board a woman by the name of penny pritzker who i you know knew from i'm on a business school board with her and it was as i described one of the more disappointing conversations in my life and it did not seem she seemed a bit like if you will deer in the headlights they they couldn't do this they couldn't do that the law was preventing them from doing various things and that led to my first ledge at the university and i sort of ended the letter you know sort of giving this president of harvard a dare to be great speech is this your opportunity you know you can fix this this could be your legacy and i sent it to the i emailed it to the president and the board members i whose email addresses i had i posted it on twitter i got no response no acknowledgment nothing and in fact the the open dialogue i had with a couple of people on the board basically got shut down after that and that led to letter number two and then and then when the congress led by elise stefanik announced an investigation of antisemitism on campus and concern about you know violations of law the president was called to testify along with two other you know the president of mit you know the president of university of pennsylvania and we're having similar issues on campus i reached out to the president of harvard and said well one the israeli government had gotten in touch and offered the opportunity for me to see the hamas if you will gopro film and i said you know what i'd love to show it at harvard and they thought that would be a great idea and so i partnered with the head of harvard chabad a guy named rabbi hershey and we were putting the film up on campus and i thought you know if the president were to see this it would give her a lot of perspective on what happened and she she should see it before her testimony and so i reached out to her or actually rabbi hershey did and he was told she would be out of town and couldn't see it and then i reached out to her again said look i'll facilitate your attendance in the congress you know come see the film i'll fly you down that was rejected and then she testified and i watched a good percentage eighty percent of the testimony of all three presidents and it was an embarrassment to the country embarrassment to the universities you know they were evasive they didn't answer questions they were rude they smirked you know they looked you know very disrespectful to to our congress and and then of course there was that several minutes where finally at least stefanik was not getting answers to her questions and she said you know let me be you know kind of clear what if protesters were calling for genocide for the jews does that violate your rules on bullying and harassment and the three of them basically gave the same answer you know it depends on the context and not until they actually execute it on the genocide does the university have the right to intervene and the the thing that perhaps bothered me the most was the incredible hypocrisy you know harvard was you know each of these universities are ranked by this entity called fire which is a nonprofit that focuses on free speech on campus and harvard it's been in the bottom quartile for the last five years and dropped to last before october seventh out out of like two hundred and fifty i should mention briefly that i've interviewed on this podcast the founder of fire and the current head of fire we discussed this at length including running for the board of harvard and the whole procedure of all that it's it's quite a fascinating investigation of free speech for people who care about free speech absolutism that's a good episode to listen to because those folks kind of fight for this idea it's a it's a difficult idea actually to internalize what does free speech in college campuses look like harvard has become a place where free speech is not tolerated on campus or at least free speech that's not part of the accepted dialogue or you know this whole notion of speech codes and microaggressions really emerged on the elite you know the harvard yale campuses of the world and you know the president of harvard's then president of harvard's explanation for why you know you could call for the genocide of the jewish people on campus was harvard's commitment to free expression and you know one of the more hypocritical statements of all time and you really can't have it both ways either harvard has to be a place where it's a free speech she basically said we're a free speech absolutist place which is why we have to allow this and harvard could not be further from that and so that was a big part of it and i was in the barber chair if you will getting haircut and i had a guy on my team send me the three minute section i said cut that line of questioning and i put out a little tweet on that and it's i call it my greatest hits of of of of posts it's got something like a hundred and ten million views and and you know everyone looked at this and said what is wrong with you know university campuses and it and their leadership and their governance by the way you know in a way this whole conversation has been about governance harvard has a disastrous governance structure which is why we have the problem we have and just to linger on the testimony you mentioned you know smirks and this kind of stuff and you mentioned dare to be great i myself am kind of a sucker for great leadership and those moments you mentioned churchill or so on even great speeches people talk down on speeches like it's maybe just words but i think speeches can define a culture and define a place define a people that can inspire and i think actually the testimony before congress could have been an opportunity to redefine what harvard is dare to be great for dare to be a great leader president harvard had a huge opportunity because she went third right the first two gave the world's most disastrous answers to the question and she literally just copied their answer which is itself you know kind of ironic in light of ultimately what happened it's tough because you can get busy as a president as a leader and so on there's these meetings so you think congress maybe you're smirking at the ridiculousness of the meeting you need to remember that many of these are opportunities to like give a speech of a lifetime sure like that if there is principles which you want to see an institution become and embody in the next several decades there's opportunities to do that and you as a great leader also need to have a sense of when is the opportunity to do that and october seventh really woke up the world on all sides honestly like there is serious issue going on here and then the protest woke up the university to there's a serious issue going on here it's an opportunity to speak on free speech and on genocide both yes do you see the criticism that you are a billionaire donor and you sort of used your power and financial influence unfairly to affect the governing structure of harvard in this case first of all i did i never threatened to use financial or other resources the only thing i did here was wrote i wrote public letters i spoke privately to a couple of members of the board i spoke for forty five minutes to the chairman none of those conversations were effective or went anywhere as far as i could tell i think my public letters and then some of the posts i do tweets yeah and that you know that little three minute video excerpt had it had an impact but it wasn't about i mean you can criticize me for being a billionaire but that had you know it was really the words it's a bit like again going back to the corporate analogy it's not the fact that you own five percent of the company that causes people to vote in your favor it's the fact that your ideas are right and i think you know i was disappointed after the congressional testimony the board of harvard said that they were a hundred percent behind unanimously a hundred percent behind president gaye and so clearly i was ineffective and ultimately what took her down was other i would say activists who identified issues with academic integrity and then she lost the confidence of the faculty and once that happens it's hard to stay and i wanted her to be fired basically or be forced to resign because of failures of leadership because cause that would have sent a message about the importance of leadership you know failure to stop emergence of antisemitism on campus and you know there's some news today the protests are getting worse is there some tension between free speech on college campuses and disciplining students for cause of genocide yes there's certainly attention and i think first of all i think free speech is incredibly important and i'm on the side i'm a lot closer to absolutism on free speech than otherwise the issue i had was the hypocrisy right they were restricting other kinds of speech on campus principally conservative speech conservative views so it wasn't a free speech absolutist campus and the protests were actually quite threatening to students and there are limits to even absolutist free speech and they begin where people feel you know intimidation harassment and you know threat to bodily harm etcetera that kind of speech is generally i think pretty technical but as people feel that they're in imminent harm by virtue of the protest that speech is at risk of not meeting the standards for free speech but harvard is a private corporation and as a private corporation they can put on what restrictions they want and harvard had introduced only a few months before bullying and harassment policies and that's why representative stefanik focused on does this it's not like she said does calling for genocide against the jews violate your free speech policy she says does calling for genocide against the jews violate your policies on bullying and harassment and i think everyone looked at this when they said it depends on the context and they said look if you've replaced jews with some other ethnic group students have been who've used the n word for example have been thrown off campus or suspended you know students who've you know hate speech directed at lgbtq people has led to disciplinary action but you know attacking spitting on jewish students or you know kinda roughing them up a bit seemed like you know we're calling for their elimination didn't seem to violate the policy so it's you know look i think a university should be a place where you have broad views and open viewpoints and broad discussion but it should also be a place where students don't feel threatened going to class where their learning is not interrupted when final exams are not interrupted what by you know people coming in and and with loud protests students asked me when i went up there what would you do if you were harvard president i said and this was before i knew what was happening on the dartmouth campus i said i would i'd convene everyone together this is harvard we have access to the best minds in the world let's have a better understanding of the history let's understand the backdrop let's focus on solutions let's bring arab and jewish and israeli students together let's form groups to create communication that's how you solve this kind of problem and none of this stuff has been done it's not that hard do you think this reveals a deeper problem in terms of ideology and the governance of harvard in the maybe the culture of harvard yes so on governance the governance structure is a disaster so the way it works today is harvard has two principal boards there's the board of the corporation the so called fellows of harvard it's a board of i think twelve independent directors and the president there's no shareholder vote there's no proxy system it's really a self perpetuating board that elects effectively elects its own members so there's you know once it becomes once the balance tips politically one way or another they can you know it can be kept that way forever there's no kind of rebalancing system you know if a us corporation goes off the rails so to speak the shareholders can get together and vote off the directors there's no ability to vote off the directors then there's the board of overseers which is i think thirty two directors and there a few years ago if you could put together six hundred signatures you could run for that board and put up a bunch of candidates and about five or six get elected each year and a group did exactly that and it was an oil and gas kind of disinvestment group they got the signatures a couple of them got elected and harvard then changed the rules and they said now we need thirty two hundred signatures and by the way if there are these dissident directors on the board we're only going to allow we're going to cap them at five so if three were elected in the oil and gas thing now there are only two seats available and then a group of former students kind of younger alums one of whom i knew approached me and said look bill we should we should run for the board and they decided this pretty late only a few weeks before the signatures were due and we love your support you know i took a look at their platform i thought it looked great i said look happy to support and i posted about them you know did a zoom with them and they got thousands of signatures you know collectively the four got whatever twelve thousand signatures or something like this and they missed by about ten percent the threshold and what did harvard do in the middle of the election they made it very very difficult to sign up you know for a vote and it just makes them look terrible and they've got now thousands of alums upset that and and again this wasn't an election it was this was just to put the names on the slate so the only candidates on the slate are the ones selected by the you know the existing members and so it's it's businesses fail because of governance failures universities fail because of governance failures it's not really the president's fault because the job of the board is to fire higher and fire the president and help guide the institution academically and otherwise so that's governance an ideology i was like how can this be october seventh the event that woke me up was thirty student organizations came out with a public letter on october eighth literally the morning after this letter was created and said israel is solely responsible for hamas's violent acts again israel had not even mounted a defense at this point and there were still terrorists running around in the southern part of israel and i'm like harvard students you know thirty four harvard student organizations signed this letter and like what is going on you know wtf right and that's when i went up on campus and i started talking to the faculty and that's where i started hearing about actually bill it's it's this dei ideology i'm like what okay dei like diversity equity inclusion you know i you know obviously i'm familiar with these words and and you know i see this in the corporate context and they say yeah and they started talking to me about this oppressor oppressed framework which is effectively taught on campus and represents the backdrop for many of the courses that are offered and and and the various some of the studies and other degree offerings i'm like i had not even heard of this and you know i'm pretty aware person but i was completely unaware and basically they're like look israel is deemed an oppressor and the palestinians are deemed the oppressed and you take the side of the the oppressed and any acts of the oppressed to dislodge the oppressor regardless of how vile or barbaric or okay i'm like okay this is a super dangerous ideology and so i wrote a like questioning post about this like here's what i'm hearing you know my is this right then i had someone a friend of mine sent me a christopher rufo's book america's cultural revolution which is sort of a sociological study of the origins of the dei movement and critical race theory and i found it actually one of the more important books i've read and also i found it quite concerning and really it's sort of a ultimately dei comes out of a kind of a marxist socialist backdrop way to look at the world and so i think there are a lot of issues with it but unfortunately it's advancing i ultimately concluded racism as opposed to fighting it which is what i thought it was ultimately about so may maybe you can speak to that book a little bit so there there's a history that traces back across decades and then that infiltrated college campuses so basically what ruffo argues is that the black power movement of the sixties really failed it was a very violent movement and many of the protagonists ended up in jail and out of that movement a number of kind of thought leaders this guy named mark hughes and others built this framework kind of an approach say look if we're gonna be successful can't be a violent movement number one and number two we need to infiltrate if you will the universities and we need to become part of the faculty and we need to teach the students and then once we take over the universities with this ideology then we can go into government and then we can go into corporations and we can change the world so i thought important book and the more i dug in the more i felt there was credibility to this not just the kind of sociological backdrop but to what it meant on campus and faculty harvard faculty were telling me that you know there's really is no such thing as free speech on campus and that you know there was a survey done i don't know a year or so ago of the harvard faculty and only two percent of the faculty admitted even in an anonymous survey admitted to being having a conservative point of view so we have a campus that's ninety eight percent non conservative liberal progressive that's adopted this dei construct and this and then i learned from a member of the search committee for the harvard president that they were restricted in looking at candidates only those who met the dei offices criteria and i shared this in one of my postings and i was accused of being racist but and that's someone who believes in that diversity is a very good thing for organizations and that equity and fairness isn't really important and having an inclusive culture is critical you know for a functioning of our organization you know so here i was someone who was like okay di sounds good to me you know at least in the small d small e i version of events but this dio ideology is really problematic so what's the way to fix this in the next few years the infiltration of dei with the upper case version of universities and the things that have troubled you the things you saw at harvard and elsewhere in the same way this was an eye opening event for me it has been for a very broad range of other people i've never gotten you know i mentioned general growth i got a lot of nice letters from people for making money on a stock that went up a hundred times but i literally get hundreds of emails letters texts handwritten letters type letters from people from the ages of twenty five to eighty five saying bill this is so important thanks for speaking out in this you were saying what you know so many of us believe but have been afraid to say you know it's described as almost a mccarthy esque kind of movement and that if you challenge the dei construct people accuse you of being a racist it's happened to me already you know i'm perhaps you know i'm i'm much less vulnerable than a university professor who can get shouted off campus and canceled i'm i'm sort of difficult to cancel but that doesn't mean people aren't gonna try and you know i've had i've been the victim of a couple of interesting articles in the last few days or at least one in particular in the washington post written by what i thought was a well meaning reporter but it's just clear that you know i've taken on some big parts of at least the progressive establishment dei i'm also believer that biden should have stepped aside a long time ago and it's only getting worse and so i'm attacking the president dei elite universities and you make some enemies doing that but i i should say i you know i'm still at mit and i i love mit and i believe in the power of great universities to explore ideas to inspire young people to think to be to inspire young people to lead let me ask okay how can you explore how to think when you're only a shared a certain point of view right how can you learn about leadership when when the the governance and leadership of the institution is is broken and exposure to ideas if you're limited in the ideas that you're exposed to so i think universities at risk i mean the concerning thing right is if thirty four student organizations that each have i don't know thirty members or maybe more right that's a thousand okay that's a meaningful percentage of the of the campus perhaps that ultimately respond now ten or so of the thirty withdrew the statement once many of the members realized what they had written so i don't think it seems like the statement was signed by the leadership and not necessarily supported by all the various students that were members but if the university teaches people these precepts this is the next generation of leader you know normally if you think about i wrote my college thesis on university admissions the reason why controlling you know the gates of the harvard institution the admissions office is important isn't many of these people who graduate end up with you know the top jobs in government and and ultimately become judges they're you know permeate through society and so it really matters what they learn and if they're limited to one side of the political aisle and they're not open to a broad array of views and this represents some of the most elite institutions in our country i think it's very problematic for the country long term yeah i one hundred percent agree and i also felt like the leadership wasn't even part of the problem as much as they were almost out of touch like unaware that this is an important moment it's an important crisis it's an important opportunity to step up as a leader and define the future of an institution so i don't even know where the source of the problem is it could be literally governance structure as movement well it's two things i think it's governance structure i also think universities are selecting they're not selecting leaders yeah you know it's not clear to me that university should necessarily be run by academics right you know the the the dean of a university you know the person who helps sort of the business of the university right and then there's the academics of the university and having a i would argue having a business leader run these institutions and then having a board that's involved a board that has itself diverse viewpoints and by the way permanently structured to have diverse viewpoints is a much better way to run a university than picking an academic that the faculty supports because you know one of the things i learned about how faculty get hired at universities ultimately it's signed off by the board but you know the new faculty are chosen by each of the various departments and once the departments tip there's sort of a tipping point politically where if once they tip in one direction the faculty recruit more people like themselves and so the departments become more and more progressive if you will with the passage of time and they only advance candidates that that match their that meet their political objectives it's it's not a great way to to build an institution which allows for small d diversity allows for yeah diversity and diversity by the way is not just race and gender and that's also something i feel very strongly about well luckily engineering robotics is touched last by this it is touched but you know i've when i'm at the computing building stata and the new one politics doesn't infiltrate or i haven't seen it infiltrate it infiltrate quite as deeply as elsewhere but it's in the biology department at harvard because biology is controversial now yes yes yes because biology and gender you know there there are there are faculty there's a woman at harvard who was literally canceled from the faculty as a member i think she was at the med school and she made the argument that there are basically two genders determined by biology she wasn't allowed to stay that's another topic for another time that's another topic you should do a show on that one that'd be an interesting one so as you said technically claudine gay the president of harvard resigned over plagiarism not over the thing that you were initially troubled by it's hard to really know right it's not like a provable fact i would say at a certain point in time she lost the confidence of the faculty and that was ultimately the catalyst and whether that was how much of that was the plagiarism issue and how much of that was some of the things that preceded it or was it all of these issues in their entirety we don't really there's no way to do a calculus can you explain the nature of this plagiarism from what you remember so aaron sarbarium and christopher rufo one from the free beacon and chris you know surfaced some allegations on or identified some plagiarism issues that i would say the initial examples were you know use of the same words with proper attribution some missing quote you know footnotes and then over time with i guess more digging they released i think ultimately something like seventy six examples of what they call plagiarism in i think eight of eleven of her articles and one of the other things that came forth here is as president of the university she had sort of the thinnest transcript academically of any previous president you know very small relatively small body of work and then when you couple that with the amount of plagiarism that was pervasive and then i guess some of the other examples that surfaced were not missing quotation marks where the authors of the work felt that their ideas had been stolen and really plagiarism is academic fraud there's there are indicia one indicia plagiarism is a missing footnote that could also be a clerical error and so when a you know professor is accused of plagiarism university does sort of a deep dive they have these administrative boards and it can take six months nine months a year to evaluate you know intent matters was it this intentional theft of another person's idea that's academic fraud or was this sloppy you know you missed or just humanity right you you miss a footnote here or there and i think once it got to a place where people felt it was theft of someone else's intellectual property that's when it became intolerable for her to stay as president of harvard so is there a spectrum for you between different kinds of plagiarism maybe plagiarizing words and plagiarizing ideas and plagiarizing novel ideas of course the common understanding of plagiarism if you look in the dictionary it's about theft theft requires a intent did the person intentionally take someone else's ideas or words now if you're if you're writing a novel right words matter more right if you're taking shakespeare and presenting it as your own words if you're you know writing about ideas you know ideas matter but you're not supposed to take someone else's words without properly acknowledging them whether it's quotation marks or otherwise but in the context of a academic's life's work before ai everyone's going to have missing quotation marks and footnotes i remember writing my own thesis you know i would write i would take the books you couldn't take out of widener library so i'd have index cards and i'd write stuff on index cards and i put a little citation to make sure i remember to cite it properly and you know scrambling to do your thesis get it in on time what's the chances you forget at what point what are your words versus the author's words and you forget to put quotation marks just the humanity you know the human fallibility of it so you know you you don't get it's not academic fraud to have human fallibility but it's academic fraud if you take someone else's ideas that are an integral part of your work is there a part of you that regrets that at least from the perception of it the the president of harvard stepped down over plagiarism versus over refusing to say that the calls for genocide are wrong again i think it would have sent a better message if a fail if a leader fails as a leader and that's the reason for their resignation or dismissal then she gets if you will caught on a technical violation that had nothing to do with failed leadership because i don't know what lesson that you know what lesson that teaches the board about selecting the next candidate i mean the future of harvard a lot of it's going to depend on who they pick as the next leader here's an interesting anecdote that i think has not surfaced publicly so a guy named larry bacow was a previous president of harvard larry bacow was on the search committee and they were looking for a new president and what was strange was they picked an old white guy to be president of harvard when there was you know a call for a more diverse president and what i learned was harvard actually ran a process had a diverse new president of harvard and in the due diligence on that candidate shortly before the announcement of the new president they found out that the president that presidential candidate had a plagiarism problem and the search had gone on long enough they couldn't restart a search to find another candidate so they pick larry bacow off the board off the search committee to be the next president of harvard as kind of an interim solution and then there was that much more pressure to have a more diverse candidate this time around because it was a big disappointment to the dei office if you will and i would say to the community at large that harvard of all places couldn't have a you know a racially diverse president it sent an important message so the strange thing is that they didn't do due diligence on president gaye and that it was a relatively quick process so the whole thing i think is worthy of further you know exploration so this goes deeper than just the president yeah for sure when a company fails most people blame the ceo i generally blame the board right because the board's job is to make sure the right person is running the company and if they're failing help the person if they can't help the person make a change that's not what's happened here the board's hand was sort of forced from the outside whereas they should have made their own decision from the inside do you still love harvard sure it's a four hundred odd year institution it enormously helpful to me in my life i'm sure my sister also went to harvard and you know with the experiences learnings friendships relationships you know again i i'm very happy with my life harvard was an important part of my life i went there for both undergrad and business school i learned a ton met a lot of faculty a lot from a number of my closest friends who i i still really keep in touch with highmed then so yeah it's a great place but it needs a a reboot yeah i i i still have hope i think universities are really important institutions you know when i went to harvard there were sixteen hundred people in my class i think today's class is about the same size and their online education really has not sort of taken off right so i heard peter thiel speak at one point in time and he's like what great institution do you know that's truly great that hasn't grown in a hundred years right and you know the incentives in some sense of the alums are for it's a bit like a club if you're proud of the elitism of the club you don't want any have any new members but the fact that the population has grown of the country is so you know significantly since certainly i was a student in nineteen eighty four and the fact that harvard recruits people from all over the world it's really serving a smaller and smaller percentage of the population today and you know some of our most talented and successful entrepreneurs anyway you know it's a token of success that they didn't make it through their undergraduate years you know they left as a freshman or they didn't attend at all for entrepreneurs yes but it's still a place very important for research very important for advancing ideas and yes and and shaping dialogue and the next generation of supreme court justices yes and you know the members of government politicians so yes it's critically important but it it's not not doing the job it should be doing neri oxman somebody you mentioned several times throughout this podcast somebody i had a wonderful conversation with a friend with i've known looked up to her admired her has been a fan i've been a fan of hers for a long time of her work and of her as a human being looks like you're a fan of hers as well yes what do you love about neri what do you admire about her as a scientist artist human being i i think she's the most beautiful person i've ever met and i mean that from like the center of her soul she's the most caring warm considerate you know thoughtful person i've ever met and and she couples those remarkable qualities with brilliance incredible creativity beauty elegance grace yeah i'm talking about my wife but i'm talking incredibly dispassionately but i mean what i say she's the most remarkable person i've ever met and i've met a lot of remarkable people and i'm incredibly fortunate to spend a very high percentage of my life time with her ever since i met her you know six years ago so she's been a help to you through some of the rough moments you described for sure i mean i met her at the bottom which is not a bad place to meet someone if it works out is there some degree of yin and yang with the two personalities you have you have described yourself as emotional and so on but it does seem the two of you have slightly different styles about how you approach the world well interestingly we there's a we have a lot of like you know we come from very similar places in the world you know there are times where you feel like we've known each other for centuries you know i met her parents for the first time you know a long time ago almost six years ago as well and i knew her parents were from eastern europe originally so i asked her father like what you know what city did her family come from originally and i called my father and asked him you know dad what's you know grandpa abraham where's he or what's the name of the city and then i put the two cities into google maps and they were fifty two miles apart which i thought was pretty cool then of course at some point we did genetic testing make sure we weren't related yeah which we were not but we share incredible commonality on values we are attracted to the same kind of people you know she loves my friends i love hers we love doing the same kind of things we're attracted to and we like spending time the same ways and she has yes more emotion more elegance she doesn't like battles but she's very strong but she's more sensitive than i am yeah you you are constantly in multiple battles at the same time and there's often the media social media it's just fire everywhere you know that hasn't really been the case for a while i've had relative peace for a long time because i as i stopped being as i haven't had to be the kind of activist i was earlier in my career i think since october seventh yes i do feel like i've been in a war can you tell me the saga of the accusations against nary so i did not actually surface the plagiarism allegations against president gay that surfaced by you know aaron and maybe christopher rufo as well or maybe chris helped promote what aaron and some anonymous person identified but i certainly it was a point in time where the board had said we're one hundred percent behind her and unanimously and i really felt she had to go so it didn't bother me at all that they had identified problems with her work so i shared i i reposted those posts and then when the board she ultimately resigned and she got a nine hundred thousand dollars a year professorship continuing at harvard i said look in light of her limited academic record and these plagiarism allegations i she i she had to go i knew when i did so i assumed i was actually a bit paranoid about that thesis i had written i only had one academic work but i hadn't checked it for plagiarism and i thought that's gonna that's gonna happen actually i had a i i had someone i i did not have a copy on hand so i got a copy of my thesis and i and i remember writing it harvard at the time was pretty they kinda gave you a lecture about making sure you have all your footnotes and quotation marks i learned later that apparently they had a copy of my thesis at the new york public library and a member of the media told me he was there online with you know a dozen other members of the media all trying to get a copy of my thesis to run it through some ai they had to first do optical character recognition to convert the paper document into digital but fortunately through a miracle i didn't have an issue i didn't think about nary of course who has whatever a hundred and thirty academic works and so we were just at the end of a vacation for christmas break and it was early in the morning for vacation time and all of a sudden i hear my phone ringing in the other room or vibrating in the other room multiple times i'm like i pick up the phone and it's our communication guy fran mcgill and he's like bill business insider has apparently identified a number of instances of plagiarism in nari's dissertation let me send you this email he sent me the email and they had identified four paragraphs in her three thirty page dissertation where she had cited the author but she had used the vast majority of the words and that those paragraphs were from the author and she should have used quotation marks and then there was one case where she paraphrased correctly an author but did not footnote that it was from his work and so we were presented with this and told they're gonna publish in a few hours and we're like well can we get to the next day we're just on you know about to head home and they're like no we're publishing by noon we need an answer by noon and so we downloaded the copy of her thesis on like the slow internet and you know neri checked it out and she said you know what looks like they're right and i said look you should just admit your mistake and she wrote a very simple gracious yes i should have used quotation marks and on the author i failed to cite she pointed out that she cited them maybe other times and wrote a several paragraph section of her thesis acknowledging you know his work and none of these were like important parts of her thesis but she acknowledged her mistake and she said you know apologize for my mistake and i apologize to the author who i failed to cite and and i stand on the shoulders of you know all the people came before me and looking to advance work we sort of thought it was over we head home in flight on the way home although we didn't realize this till we got back the following day business insider published another article and said nari oxman admits to plagiarism plagiarism of course is academic fraud and this thing goes crazy viral oh bill is the title is bill ackman's wife mhmm celebrity academic mary oxman and they use the term celebrity because there are limits to what legitimate media can go after but you know celebrities there's a lot more leeway in the media and what they can say so that's why they call her a celebrity first time ever she'd been called a celebrity and and they they basically she's admitting to academic fraud and then they said and then the next day at five nineteen pm i remember the timeline pretty well an email was sent to fran magill saying you know we've identified you know two dozen other instances of plagiarism in her work fifteen of which are wikipedia entries where she copied definitions and the others were mostly software hardware manuals for various devices or software she used in her work most of which were in footnotes where she described a nozzle for a three d printer or something like this and they said we're publishing you know tonight the email they sent to us was sixty nine hundred words it was twelve pages it was practically indecipherable you couldn't even read it in an hour and we didn't have some of the documents they were referring to and i'm like nari you know what i'm going to do it i think it will be useful to provide context here i'm gonna do a review of every mit professor's dissertations every published paper ai has enabled this and so that was i put out a tweet basically saying that and we're doing a test run now because we have to get it right and i think it would be a useful exercise provide some context if you will and then this thing goes crazy viral and you know neri is a pretty sensitive person pretty emotional person and someone who's a perfectionist and having everyone in the world thinking you committed academic fraud is a pretty damning thing now they did say they did a thorough review of all of her work and this is what they found i'm like sweetheart that's remarkable i did one hundred and thirty works seventy three of which were peer reviewed blah blah blah and she's published in nature science and all these different publications that's actually it's pretty good batting average but you know they can't this is wrong right this is not academic fraud okay these are inadvertent mistakes and the wikipedia entries neri actually used wikipedia as a dictionary this is the early days of wikipedia and they also referred to the mit handbook which has a whole section on plagiarism academic handbook and if you read it which i ultimately did they make clear a few things number one there's plagiarism academic fraud and there's what they call inadvertent plagiarism which is clerical errors where you make a mistake and it depends on intent and there's a link that you can go to which is a section on if you get investigated at mit what happens what's the procedure what's the initial stage what's the investigative stage what's the procedure if they identify it and they make very clear that academic fraud is and they list plagiarism you know research theft a few other things but it does not include honest errors honest errors are not plagiarism under mit's own policies and in the handbook they also have a big section on what they call common knowledge and common knowledge depends on who you're writing your thesis for and so if it's a fact that is known by your audience you're not required to quote or cite and so all those wikipedia entries were for things like sustainable design computer aided design she just took a definition from wikipedia common knowledge to her readers no obligation under the handbook totally exempt on the using the same words she referred to like an whatever some kind of three d printer she was the stratasys three d printer and she quoted from the manual right away stratasys is a company you consulted for they're very happy you don't need to that's not something you're not stealing your ideas you're describing a nozzle for a device you use in your work and a footnote that's not a theft of idea right and so i'm like this is crazy and so this has got to stop and so i reach out to the a guy i knew was on the board of business insider the chairman and his name is gonna come public shortly i committed to that time to keep his name confidential it's now surfaced publicly in the press can i just pause real quick here just to i don't know there's a lot of things i wanna say but you made it pretty clear but just as a member of the community there's also like a common sense test i think you're more precisely like legal and looking at sure but there's just like a bullshit test and like nothing that nary did is plagiarism in the bad meaning of the word plagiarism right now is becoming another ism like racism or so on using as an attack word i don't care what the meaning of it is but there's the bad academic fraud like theft yes theft of an idea and maybe you can say a lot of definitions and this kind of stuff but then there's just a basic bullshit test where everyone knows this is a thief and this is definitely not a thief and there's nothing about anything that neri did anything in her thesis or in her life everyone that knows her she's a rock star right i just wanna make it clear it really hurt me that the internet whatever is happening could go after could go after a great scientist because i love science and i love celebrating great scientists and it's just really messed up that whatever the machine we could talk about business insight or whatever social media mass hysteria whatever is happening like we need the great scientists of the world because that's like the future depends on them and so we need to celebrate them and protect them and let them flourish and let their do their thing and like keep them out of this whatever shit storm that we're doing to get clicks and advertisements and drama and all this kind we need to protect them so i just wanna say there's there's no there's nobody i know and a million friends that are scientists world class scientists nobel prize winners they all love neri they all respect neri there's she did zero wrong and then the rest of the conversation we can have about how broken journalism is and so on but like i just wanna say that there's nothing that nary did wrong it's not a gray area or so on i also personally don't love that claudine gay is a discussion about plagiarism because it distracts from the fundamentals that is broken this becomes like some weird technical discussion but in case scenario did nothing wrong great scientist great engineer at mit and beyond she's doing the cool thing now so anyway could not have said it better myself now obviously i'm focused on the technical part right because you wanna be oh yes be precise here well it's not even that i mean yes i have said that we're gonna sue business insider and and in thirty five years of my career of someone who has not every article has been a favorable one not every article has been an accurate one i've never threatened to sue the media and i've never sued the media but this is so egregious it's not just that she did nothing wrong but they accused her of academic fraud they did it knowing they they make reference to mit's own handbook so they had to read all of the same stuff that i read in the handbook they did that work then after i you know escalated this thing to the you know henry blodgett the chairman of business insider to the ceo of axel springer i even reached out to henry kravis at a certain point in time one of the controlling shareholders of the company laying out the factual errors in the article business insider went public after they said nary committed academic fraud and plagiarism and said we never we didn't challenge any the facts remain undisputed in the article so so it's basically neri committed plagiarism that's story one neri admits to plagiarism she admits to plagiarism she admitted to she admitted to making a few clerical errors that's the only thing she admitted to and she graciously apologized so they said neri admits to plagiarism apologizes for plagiarism that's incredibly damning and by the way we're doing an investigation because we're concerned that there might have been inappropriate process but the facts of the story have not been disputed by nary oxman or bill ackman and that was totally false i had done it privately i had done it publicly on twitter on x i laid out i i have a whole tech stream a whatsapp stream with the ceo of the company and they and they double down they double down again and so i don't sue people lightly and you know stay tuned so you're at least for now moving forward with it's a certainty we're moving forward there's a step we can take prior to suing them where we basically send them a letter demanding they make a series of corrections that if they if they don't make those corrections the next step is litigation i hope we can avoid the next step and i'm just making sure that we when we present the demand to business insider and ultimately to axel springer that it's incredibly clear how they defamed her the factual mistakes in her stories and what they need to do to fix it and if we can fix it there we can move on from this episode and hopefully avoid litigation so that's where we are i don't know you're smarter than me there's technical stuff there's legal stuff there's journalistic stuff but just fuck you business insider for doing this i don't know i don't know much in this world but journalists aren't supposed to do that no look at it we're gonna surface all this stuff publicly ultimately the email was not to nary saying there was plagiarism in her work the email came from a reporter named catherine long the headline was your wife committed plagiarism shouldn't she be fired from mit just like you caused claudine gay to be fired from harvard yeah it was it was a political agenda she doesn't like me okay and she was trying to hurt me and they couldn't find plagiarism in my thesis and you know being the subject of short being a short seller the herbalife battle went on for years they tried to do everything to destroy my reputation so they're already gone through my trash they already done all that work so anything they could possibly find you know i've always lived a very clean life okay thankfully and if you're gonna be an activist shortcell you better because they're gonna find out dirt on you if if it exists and so they're like how can we really hurt bill by the way mit neri had left mit years earlier yes when the reporter found out she was no longer a member of the mit faculty they were enraged they didn't believe us they made us like you know prove to us she's no longer on the mit faculty because they wanted to get her fired and by the way malice is one of the you know important factors in determining whether someone whether defamation has taken place and this was a malice driven this was not about news and the the unfortunate thing about journalism is business insider made a fortune from this this story was published and republished by thousands of media organizations around the world it was the number one trending thing on twitter for like two days it every newspaper every it was on the front page of every israeli newspaper you know was on the front page of the financial times okay so this and she's building a business mhmm and you know if if you're ceo of a science company and you committed economic fraud that's incredibly damaging but i ultimately convinced her that this was good i said sweetheart you're amazing you're incredible you're incredibly talented but you're mostly known in the design world now everyone in the universe okay has heard of nari oxman okay we're gonna get this thing cleared up you're gonna be doing an event in in six months where you're gonna tell the world you're gonna go out of stealth mode you can tell the world about all the incredible things that you've you're building and you're designing and you're creating and you're gonna it's gonna be like the iphone launch because everyone's gonna be paying attention and they're gonna they're gonna wanna see your work and you know that's how i try to cheer up but i think it's true it is true but it's and you're doing your your job is a good part in seeing the silver lining of all this how is just from observing her how did she's you know stay strong through all of this psychologically because at least i know she's pushing ahead with the work oh she's supposed to be ahead in her work she's built an amazing team she's hired thirty scientists roboticists people who biologists plant specialists material scientists engineers really incredible crew she's built this thirty six thousand square foot lab in new york city that's a one of a kind it's still you know they're working out of it it's still under construction while they're working out of it and so she's gonna do amazing things but as i said she's an extremely sensitive person she's a perfectionist k imagine thinking that the entire world thinks you've committed academic fraud and so that was very hard for her she's a very positive person but i saw her in i would say her darkest emotional period for sure she's doing much better now but you can kill someone you can kill someone with by destroying their reputation people people commit suicide people go into these deep dark depression well my worry primarily when i saw what business insider was doing is that they might dim the light of a of of a truly special scientist and creator it's not gonna happen but i also worry about others like nary young narys that are that this sends a signal to that might scare them and you know journalism shouldn't scare aspiring young scientists the problem is the defamation law in the us is so favorable to the publisher to the media and so unfavorable to the victim and the incentives are all wrong you know the when you went from a paper version of journalism to digital and you could track how many people click and it's a medium that advertising drives the economics and if you can show an advertiser more clicks you can make more money right so a journalist is incentivized to write a story that will generate more clicks how do you write a story that generate more clicks you get a billionaire guy okay and then you go after his wife and you make a sensationalist story and you give them no time to respond right you know look at the timing here they on the first story you know they gave us three hours on the second one the following day five nineteen pm the email comes in not to neri not to her firm but to my communications person who tracks us down by five thirty you know ten minutes later and they published their story ninety two minutes after and they sent us we're gonna surface all these documents in our demand read the email they sent whether you could even decipher it it's you know it it's there was no and by the way there's a reason why academic institutions when a professor is accused of plagiarism why they have these very careful processes with multiple stages and they take they can take a year or more because it depends on intent was this intentional in order to be a crime an academic crime you gotta prove that they intentionally stole look in some cases it's obvious in some cases it's very subtle and they take this stuff super seriously but they basically accused nari of academic crime and and then ninety two minutes later they said she committed an academic crime and that should be a crime and that should be punishable with litigation and there should be a real cost and we're gonna make sure there's a real cost reputationally and otherwise to business insider and to axel springer because ultimately you gotta look to the controlling owner you know they're responsible i'll just say that you in this regard are inspiring to me for for for facing basically an institution that whole purpose is to to write articles so you're like going into the fire my kids' school the epithets of the school or the saying is go forth unafraid i think it's a good way to live and again i'm words can't harm me you know the the power of x and and we do owe elon enormous thanks for this is now so for example the washington post wrote a story about me a couple days ago mhmm and i didn't i didn't think the story was a fair story so within a few hours of the story being written i'm able to put out a response to the story and and send it to a million two hundred thousand people and it gets read and reread i haven't checked but you know probably five million people saw my response now those are the people on x it's not everyone in the world there's still there's a disconnection between the x world and the offline world but you know reputation in my business is basically all you have and as they say you can take a lifetime to build reputation and take five minutes to have it disappear and the media plays a very important role and they can destroy people at least we now have some ability to fight back we have a platform we can surface our views you know the typical old days are they write an incredibly damning article and you point out factual errors and then like two months later they bury a little correction on page whatever by then the person was fired or where their life is destroyed or the reputation is damaged you know it was with warren buffet talking about media and it's something he a business he really loves and he says you know what bill he said a thief with a dagger the only person who caused you more harm than a thief with a dagger is a journalist with a pen and those were very powerful words so you think x formerly known as twitter is a kind of neutralizing force to that to the power of centralized journalistic institutions hundred percent and i think it's a really important one and it's really been eye opening for me to see how stories get covered in mainstream media and then you actually what i do on x is i follow people on multiple sides of an issue and you can or i post on a topic and i get to hear the other side you know i read the replies and it you know the truth is something that people have had a lot of question about particularly in the last i would say five years you know beginning with you know trump's talking about fake news and a lot of what trump said about fake news is true you know the world a big part of the world hated trump and did everything they could to discredit him destroy him and you know he did a lot of things perhaps deserving of being being discredited by by a very imperfect in some cases harmful leader but you know everything from pre election you know the the hunter biden laptop story near post that you know then twitter you know made it difficult for people to to share and to read you know covid you know the jay baaderas of the world questioning the government's response questioning you know the you know long term lockdowns questioning keeping kids out of school questions about masks about vaccines which are still not definitively answered no counterbalance to the power of the government when the government can shut down avenues for free speech and where the mainstream media has kind of towed the line in many sense to the government's action so having a independently owned powerful platform is very important for truth for free speech for hearing the other side of the story for counterbalancing the power of the government elon is getting you know a lot of pushback you know the spacexs and teslas of the world are experiencing a lot of government you know questions and investigations and you know even the president of the united states came out and said look he's worth he needs to be investigated you know i'm getting my own version of that in terms of some negative media articles i don't know what's next but yeah if you stick your neck out in today's world and you go against the establishment or at least the existing administration you can find yourself in a very challenged place and that discourages people from sharing stuff and that's why anonymous speech is important some of what you find on twitter you mentioned trump i have to talk to you about politics sure amongst all the other battles you've also been a part of that one maybe you can correct me on this but you've been a big supporter of various democratic candidates over the years but you did say a lot of nice things about donald trump in two thousand sixteen i believe so i was interviewed by andrew sorkin a week after trump won the election yes and i made my case for why i thought he could be a good president yes so what was the case back then to which degree did that turn out to be true and to which degree did it not to which degree was he a good president to which degree was he not a good president look i think what i said at the time was the united states is actually a huge business mhmm and it reminds me a bit of the type of activist investments we've taken on over time where this really really great business has kinda lost its way and with the right leadership we can fix it and if you think about the business of the united states today right you've got thirty two trillion dollars worth of debt so it's over leveraged and it's highly leveraged and the leverage is only increasing we're losing money i e revenues aren't covering expenses the cost of our debt is going up as interest rates have gone up and the debt has to be rolled over we have enormous administrative bloat in the the country the the regulatory regime is incredibly complicated and burdensome and impeding growth our relations with our competitor nations and our friendly nations are are are far from ideal and those conditions were present in twenty twenty as well they're just i would say worse now and i said look it's a great thing that we have a businessman as president and in my lifetime i was really the first businessman as opposed to i mean maybe bush to some degree was a business person but i thought okay i was one of the ceo to be ceo of america and now we have trump look he's got some personal qualities that seem less ideal but he's gonna be president of the united states he's gonna rise to the occasion this is gonna be his legacy and he knows how to make deals and he's got he's gonna recruit some great people into his administration i hoped and you know growth can solve a lot of our problems so if we can get rid of a bunch of regulations that are holding back the country we can have a president obama was a i would say not a pro business president he did not love the business community he did not love successful people and having a president who just changed the tone on on being a pro business president i thought would be good for the country and that's basically what i said and i would say trump did a lot of good things and a lot of people you can get criticized for acknowledging that but you know i i think the the country's economy accelerated dramatically and that by the way you know the the capitalist system helps the people at the bottom best when the system does well and when the economy does well you know the black unemployment rate was the lowest in history when trump was president and that's true for other minority groups so it was good for the economy and he you know he recognized some of the challenges and issues and threats of china early he kind of woke up nato now that again the way he did all this stuff you can object to but you know nato actually started spending more money on defense in the early part of trump's presidency because of his threats which turned out to be a good thing in light of you know the ultimately the russia ukraine war and i think if you analyze trump objectively based on policies he did a lot of good for the country i think what's bad is he did some harm as well you know the i do think civility disappeared in america with trump as president a lot of that's his personal style and how important is civility i do think it's important i do think you know he was attacked very aggressively by the left by the media that made him paranoid it probably interfered with his ability to be successful he had you know the russian collusion investigation overhang and when someone's attacked they're not gonna be at their best particularly if they're paranoid i think there's some degree of that but i'm you know i'm giving kind of the best of defense of trump you know just you look at how he managed his team right very few people made it through the trump administration without getting fired or quitting and yeah he would say they're the greatest person in the world when he hired them and they're a total disaster when he fired them it's not an inspiring way to be a leader and to attract really talented people i think the events surrounding the election you know i think january six he could have done a lot more to stop a riot i i don't consider it an insurrection but a riot that takes place in our capital and where police officers are killed or die commit suicide because for failure to as they sought to do their job you know he stepped in way too late to stop that he could have stopped it early you know many of his words i think inspired people you know some of whom with malintent to go in there and cause harm and literally to shut down the government there were some evil people unfortunately there so he's been a very imperfect president and also i think contributed to the you know extreme amount of divisiveness in our country so i was ultimately disappointed by you know the note of optimism and again i always you know support the president i trust the people ultimately to select our next leader you know it's a bit like who wants to be a millionaire you know when you go to the crowd and the crowd says a certain thing you got to trust the crowd but usually in who wants to be a millionaire it's a landslide in one direction so you know which which letter to pick here we had an incredibly close election which itself is a problem so you know my dream and what i've you know i've tried a little bit played politics in the last little period to support some alternatives to trump so that we have a president you know i i use the you know example imagine you woke up in the morning it's election day whatever it is it's november fourth whatever twenty twenty four and you still haven't figured out who to vote for because the candidates are so appealing that you don't know which lever to pull because it's a tough call that's the choice we should be making as americans it shouldn't be i'm a member of this party i'm only gonna vote this way i'm a member of that party i'm gonna vote the other way and i hate the other side mhmm and that's where we've been unfortunately for too long or you might be torn because both candidates are not good yeah so you wanna i i love a future where i'm torn because the choices are so amazing the problem is the party system is so screwed up and the parties are self interested and they're they're they're there's another governance problem right an incentive problem michael porter who was one of my professors at harvard business school wrote a brilliant piece on the american political system and all the incentives and market dynamics and what he called the competitive analysis and it's a must read i should dig it up and you know send it around on x but it explains how the you know the parties and the incentives of these sort of self sustaining entities that you know where the people involved are not incentivized to do what's best for the country it's a problem you've been a supporter of dean phillips yes for the twenty twenty four us presidential race yes what do you like about dean i think he's a honest smart motivated capable proven guy as a business leader and i think in six almost you know in his three terms in congress he ran when trump was elected he said you know kids cried his daughters cried inspired him to run for office ran in a republican district in minnesota for the last sixty years was elected in the landslide has been reelected twice moved up the ranks in the congress you know respected by his fellow members of congress advanced some important legislation during covid on you know senior roles on various foreign policy committees centrist you know considered i think the second most bipartisan member of the congress i'd love to have a bipartisan president that's the only way to get kind of go forward but we'd enormously benefit if we had a president that chose policies on the basis of what's best for the country as opposed to what his party wanted what i like about him is he's financially independent he's not a billionaire but he doesn't need the job the party hates him now because he's challenged the king right and so but he's willing to give up his political career because what he thought was best for the country he tried to get other people to run who were of higher profile had more name recognition none would no one wants to challenge biden you know if they wanna be have a chance to stay in office or run-in the future but he's very principled i think he'd be a great president but he needs his shot is michigan but he needs to raise money in order to he's only got a couple weeks and he's gotta be on tv there that's expensive so we'll see so he has to increase name recognition all that kind of stuff also as you mentioned he's young yeah he's fifty five but he's a young fifty five you see him play hockey yeah i mean i guess fifty five no matter what is a pretty young age i'm fifty seven i i feel young i can do more pull ups today than i could as a kid so that's a standard you're at the top of your tennis game i'm at the top of my tennis game for sure maybe there's someone that would disagree with that and by the way the other thing to point out here is and i have been pointing this out as of others biden is i think he's done i mean it's embarrassing it's embarrassing for the country having him as a as a presidential candidate let alone the president of the country it's crazy and it's just gonna get worse and worse and he should you know hit the worst of his legacy is his ego that prevents him from stepping aside and that's it it's his ego and it is so wrong and so bad and so embarrassing you know when you talk to people i was in europe i was in london a few days ago and people are like bill how can this guy be a president and it's a bit like again i go back to my business analogy being a ceo is like a full contact sport being president of the united states is like some combination of wrestling marathon running you know try being a triathlete i mean you gotta be at the serious physical shape and at the top of your game to represent this country and he is a far cry from that and it's just getting worse and it's embarrassing and i and he's got he cannot be and by the way every day he waits he's handing the election to trump because it's harder and harder for an alternative candidate to surface now dean is the only candidate left on the democratic side that can still win delegates he's on the ballot in forty two states and the best way for biden to step aside is for dean to show well in michigan and so you think there is a path with the delegates and all that kind of stuff hundred percent so if you if what has to happen is what new hampshire he went from zero to twenty percent of the vote and and ten weeks with no name recognition mhmm you know i helped a little bit elon helped we did a spaces for him we had three hundred and fifty thousand people on the spaces some originally forty thousand live or something and then the rest after and then he was on the ground in new hampshire and new hampshire is one of the states where you don't need to be registered to a party to vote for that candidate so it's like jumble and he got twenty percent and that's with a lot of independents and democrats voting for haley haley who i like and who i've supported does not look like she's gonna make it you know trump is really kinda running the table and so vote for haley as an independent in michigan maybe throw away your vote i think it increases the likelihood that dean can get those independent votes if he he could theoretically again he needs he needs money he could beat biden in michigan biden's doing very poorly in michigan his polls are terrible the muslim community is not happy with him and he really has spent no time there and so if he's embarrassed in michigan in michigan it could be a catalyst for him withdrawing then dean will get funding if he wins michigan or shows well in michigan and people say he's viable he's the only choice we have he'll attract from the center he'll attract from people republicans he'll attract from the center he'll attract from people republicans who won't vote for trump of which they're a big percentage could be sixty percent or more it could be seventy percent won't vote for trump and also from the democrats so i think he's a really interesting candidate but we gotta get the word out yeah i got a chance to chat with dean i really like him i really like him and i think the next president of the united states is gonna have to meet and speak regularly with zelensky putin netanyahu with world leaders and have some of the most historic conversations agreements negotiations and i just don't see biden doing that no and not for any reason but sadly age i mean think about it this way when biden's present now you saw his recent impromptu press conference which he did after the special prosecutor you know report basically saying the guy was way past his prime and then he confused the president of mexico and the president of egypt so they're very careful when they roll him out and he's scripted and he's always reading from a lectern imagine the care they have in exposing him and it when they expose him it's terrible okay imagine how bad it is for real so it's not good no bad really bad for america and i'm upset with him and upset with his family i'm upset with his wife you know this is the time where the people closest to you have to put their arms around you and say you know dad you know honey you've you know you've done your thing this is gonna be your legacy and it's not gonna be a good one great leaders should also know when to step down yeah and one of the best tests of a leader is succession planning this is a massive failure of succession planning outside of politics let me look to the future first in terms of the financial world what are you looking forward to in the next couple of years you have a new fund like what are you thinking about in terms of investment your own and the entire economy and maybe even the the economy of the world sure so the sec doesn't allow doesn't like us to talk about new funds that we're launching that we filed with the sec sure but i would say i do and by the way if anyone's ever interested in a fund they should always read the prospectus carefully including the risk factors that's very very important but i like the idea of democratizing access to good investors and i think that's an interesting trend so we wanna be part of that trend in terms of financial markets generally the economy you know a lot of it's going to depend upon the next leader of the country so we're kind of right back there you know the the leadership of the united states is important for the us economy it's important for the global economy it's important for global peace and we've gone through a really difficult period and it's time we need a break but you know look i think the united states is an incredibly resilient country we have some incredible moats among them we have the atlantic and the pacific and we have you know peaceful neighbors to the north and the south we're an enormously rich country capitalism still works effectively here i get optimistic about the world when i talk to my friends who are either venture capitalists or my hobby of backing these young entrepreneurs i talk to a founder of a startup if you want to get optimistic about the world so i think technology is gonna save us i think ai of course has its frightening terminator like scenarios but i'm gonna take the the opposite view that this is gonna be a huge enabler of productivity and scientific discovery drug discovery and it's gonna make us healthier happier and better so i do think you know the internet revolution was you know had a lot of good some obviously some bad i think the ai revolution is going to be similar but we're at this other really interesting juncture in the world you know with technology and we're gonna have to use it for our good on the media front i'm happy about x and i think elon's gonna be successful here i think advertisers will realize it's a really good platform the best way to reach me if you wanna sell something to me i suppose i've actually bought stuff on some some ads and x i don't remember the last time i responded to direct response advertising you know in terms of my business i have an incredible team it's tiny we're one of the smallest firms relative to the assets we manage it's a bit like you know the the navy seals you know not the us army we have only forty people at pershing square so it's a tight team i think we'll do great things i think we're early on you know my ambitions investment wise i've always wanted to i've i've always said i'd like to have a record as good as warren buffett's the problem is each year he adds on another year he's now in his ninety third year so i've got thirty six more years to just get where he is and i think he's gonna add a lot a lot more years i'm excited about seeing what neri is gonna produce you know she's building an incredible company they're trying to solve a lot of problems with respect to products and buildings and their impact on the environment her vision is how do we design products that by virtue of the product's existence the world is a better place you know today you make you know her her world is a world where the existence of the new car actually is better for the environment than if the new car hadn't existed and think about that in every product scale that's what she's working on i don't wanna give away too much but you're gonna see some early examples of what she's working on so again i get excited about the future and and crises are sort of a terrible thing to waste and we've had a number of these here i think this disaster in the middle east my prediction is the next few months this war will largely be over in terms of getting rid of hamas i think i can envision a world in which saudi arabia some some of the other gulf states come together take over the governance and reconstruction of of of gaza security guarantees are put in place the abraham accords continue to grow a deal is made terrorists are ostracized that this october seventh experience on the harvard penn mit columbia unfortunately other campuses is a wake up call for universities generally you know people see the problems with dei but understand the importance of diversity and inclusion but not as a political movement but as a way that we return to a meritocratic world where someone's background is relevant in understanding their contribution but it's not we don't have race quotas and things that were made illegal years ago actually being implemented in organizations on campus so i think there's we can go through a corrective phase and i'm an optimist and i hope i hope we get there so you have hope for the entirety of it even for harvard i have hope even even for harvard it's generally hard to break four hundred year old things well i share your hope and you're a fascinating mind a brilliant mind persistent as you like to say and fearless the fearless part is truly inspiring and this was an incredible conversation thank you thank you for talking today bill thank you lex thanks
