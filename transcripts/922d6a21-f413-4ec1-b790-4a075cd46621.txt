love him there's a quote there's nothing to writing all you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed do you agree with that i agree i agree well i agree with that with journaling because i i can't write i can't write stand up like i can't write a bit but if i journal i'll find something that i go just write kinda writing where your the pen's moving faster than your brain and they're kinda like doing it together the thing i liked about ernest hemingway this is so stupid i'm a little dyslexic and so i'm not a good reader and so he wrote very simply and it wasn't until after i read a bunch of ernest hemingway i was working at barnes and noble and this person said don't you love his titles and i was like yeah sun also rises and they're like yeah but no the sun also rises and i was like yeah sun also rises and they're like no this no the sun also rises and i went oh oh yeah that is fucking badass yeah and then i but i'm like always late to the party with anything and then that night we were all doing coke and it was like five in the morning and we ended up on the roof of my apartment in greenwich village and that's the the like i'm a sunset guy i go up in florida mhmm but sunrises in new york are electric blue like electric blue and i was like the sun also rises yeah he was so good with just a handful of words yeah the simplicity the choice of words like basically his process is carving down write drunk edit sober write drunk edit sober yeah but he was good at like at like a small amount of words to to get a point across i'm the exact fucking opposite well he's also said the first draft of anything is always shit is that is that true for you i think so it's the best one i have it goes downhill from there so for you editing is destroying the original the first time i tell the first time i tell it it's perfect it's perfect it it just it works and then i go great and then i take it and i try to fix it and make it better and jazzier i just joke and razzle dazzle about my daughters and i driving past this deaf child sign and i just told it on stage it just happened and louie was in the audience he was i love that joke i said really he goes yeah and i just told it and i went done louis ck says he likes a joke it's fucking it's in the special mhmm and i tried to fucking razzle dazzle that joke into like a fifteen minute bit it got to the point where it was so it was so bad that i i i told him i i did a podcast with him i said what did you like about that joke because i can't get it to work anymore mhmm because it was just simple it was simple that your daughter didn't know how they'd figure out where deaf kids lived i went that's it he's like yeah i was like nothing about gun control and he was like i was like oh fuck man i really fucked that joke up and then i had to i had to go back to the beginning of it but that first time that's when that's when the joke comes out purest for me and then it's always chasing back to get that get that first telling some jokes are different like the machine obviously was a much longer story and like and like escape room for this one the longer stories take a little work but the the simple ones like like the deaf child in pajamas and those first times are perfect what do you think is is it about the machine story that works that was so captivating for people i think it's a i think i don't know i really wish i i don't know i think it's a good story i think it's a good story i think everyone has something similar that happened in their life where they had a crazy night mhmm and that no one believed and they told their friends and their and and or they experienced that with a friend like that and and and i think i think that's gotta be it i really don't know i think there's a part of i think there's a part of the like our community of of comedy fans that were that early death squad that was fun to watch someone take something from the podcast and turn it into a bit on stage yeah i think there's a lot of that but i think people identify with a wild crazy night that got out of control that they've probably had too i i think i don't fucking know do you think putin knows who you are because of that story i hope so i fucking hope so i hope so but there's there's a part of me that that you gotta understand is like i'm not i say stuff like that i'm sure there's someone who hears that and they go who is this fucking narcissist you're like no that's not it i'm just telling you the truth like i understand what i'm supposed to say well you know i don't know i you know i i don't know that's hard to say but i don't fucking give a shit about that guy mhmm i'm not that guy i'm telling you everything that comes out of my mouth the second it comes out i'm gonna be hundred percent honest i don't know any other way to live i kinda hope so that would be fucking cool and i look i know he's a bad i guess he's a bad dude i don't follow politics don but it'd be cool if like one day someone's like he's he's on his computer and some guy goes and he's like and and he's like and he's like and he shows it to him and and then he's like fucking this guy it's not out of the realm of possibility that putin has watched it and yet this this podcast has kinda made me realize how like small the world is i've gotten to meet some incredibly like yeah especially the people interesting people that like that's i mean that's the thing where i go like it's gotten really crazy the internet's really insane and netflix is really insane and the reach of like people that like is really simple but like i'm a big fan of the show drink champs i didn't think in a million years nori would ever know who i was and then he offered me to come do his podcast and then when i got there he told me he was a fan of mine and i went like i remember moving to new york listening to you and capone like i'm sitting there going wow yeah like and and then and the phone calls i've gotten since the movie came out and since razzle dazzle came out have been really insane when you realize as much as i know about people and i i like i there's people i'm fans of that don't know who i am that that that like that are like they're like some pitcher in fucking florida that i follow the kids i like i think i just fun to watch and pitch there was a softball player in tempe then she's do catching drills and i was really into softball with my daughter and we watch her catching girls there's a girl dee glaser who me and my daughters will watch her dance videos and then i hit her up she's like you know who i am and you're like oh yeah that's the way the world works what world leader would you drink with if you could so you mentioned putin fuck so putin doesn't drink much yeah zelensky drinks more but also not much boris yeltsin would have been a good he would have been a fucking good one i mean like i i i go hitler was a pussy like he he drank wine with a with a cup with a spoonful of sugar in it you never drank what churchill that's my hold on that's my guy yeah you know that's my guy right no i don't know that's your guy so he he did champagne no let me well you don't have to tell me a thing about winston churchill he i found out about his daily routine yeah so his daily routine was a big breakfast cigar coffee eggs over eggs sunny side up toast bacon sausage tomato beans fruit orange juice soft scotch cigar in bed and he'd sit there for three hours mhmm and he'd hold morning breakfast and that's they'd come in and he'd run through his day and then he'd get in the bathtub for fucking an hour and drink champagne and then he'd go to lunch and have some goose or whatever the fuck they ate back then with more champagne and then and then and then i mean and then he take a nap and like i love that so every year on the day of his death i think it's january twenty fourth i celebrate winston churchill's life by living the way he did mhmm and so i have breakfast in bed with the soft scotch and i just party all fucking day that would be the guy to drink with that would be the guy if you could pick anyone to drink with he drank every day throughout the day he lived like ninety four and was one of the most heroic figures in human history never never surrender i mean what a fucking badass thing you know he taught he taught the queen the queen was like a like a like a window licking idiot right like she was she had a third grade education so like her dad dies and she's like ten or twelve or whatever the first thing they do is they pull her out of school they're like you're done learning you're just gonna be the queen you gotta know this is what you need to learn don't make let people make eye contact with you put your hand out like this don't let people touch you so she like had she had like a really i saw the by the way i didn't do this research i just watched the crown okay and winston churchill kind of taught her about world politics and was that they like come in and she'd be like winston what did we do in africa and he's like this is gonna be a tough one and so yeah so but winston churchill is the badass but if i had to drink with someone living like drink there's like there's a two obvious one like obviously it's fucking kim jong un right you kinda wanna he drinks no he does you think my ivs are good in the morning you know kim jong un's ivs are next you're like i feel up and he's like it's on saturday he would be a badass to drink with i think he drinks hard liquor i think it's scotch johnny walker blue that's what i've heard i don't know where you heard this but i like this okay so i say things like that but then i'm sure i i i i i i don't know if you ever party with someone who just parties a little different than you and then you notice like like sometimes like athletes and then like you're at a strip club and then they they they talk weird to a woman you're like oh that's not me i'm so sorry so that'd be the thing the atrocities would be hard to get past with them not just the atrocity but the way of being i agree with you i actually don't like drinking with rich and powerful people often there's something weird about them yeah not not all of them mhmm and i don't like i don't like a drinking meeting like when someone goes what's like drinking like like what was that then people go like hey i'm taking you out tonight we're drinking yeah and then i go that's not the way i like to do it it gives me anxiety like our lives are very different you and i yeah were you in a fraternity no we could start there yet no i was not okay that's the the and the differences continue from there i'm sure so when you get your pledge pin uh-huh they take you out and their whole thing is you're gonna we're getting you fucked up yeah that energy is not my energy i don't like that like it's i just go why don't we just get drunk and feel really good about ourselves like i never like took mushrooms to see jesus i just wanted to enjoy rain x on a windshield like so like that that for me is like one of my things so if if kim jong un flew me to north korea to drink with him i'd be like i'd have to start really getting blackout drunk on the plane to enjoy drinking with him that day what's your favorite like different occasions what's your favorite drink what's your favorite way of drinking it's it's it's i've got it varies so what are the different contexts here it's like one on one one on one like you sit down with i don't know rogan invites you like it's a godfather to sit down and finally have a talk about something it's gonna be whiskey it's gonna be like a nice whiskey neat no i like it on the rocks i like lots of rocks it won't be something expensive because rogen is not he's not a fancy boy you know like he's a real regular he's a really regular dude he's gotten less regular the more millions of dollars he has i think there are parts of him where you're like yeah like where you're like oh wow we can do this yeah but he's a he'd he'd be like jack on the rocks or like bud buffalo trace or one of the maybe whiskey he's buying roganbee whiskey rocks and then like that's a good i i haven't hung out with joe by ourselves i take that back i was with him the other night but like it would be cool my times with joe's are are always on podcasts yeah and his i miss the times where it was where you just have you and him at a at a at the store late night yeah i i'm okay with podcasts like i i used to think this is like performative or something like this but it's not really no it's just a chance to really sit down i enjoy it because of the people i could never sit down with ah like david cross i would never sit down with david cross because we don't run-in the same circles and but it's nice he has something to promote and then he comes to my house and and then we can sit down for an hour and talk and then i and then or kevin smith like people i would never really hang out with tom i enjoy being alone with tom more off mic tom segura yeah we have a lot of history there's a lot of things secrets we know about each other and there's a lot of secrets going on in our each other's lives that i would never share on podcast that i that i can talk to him about and i really appreciate his and i know this isn't on brand of us beating each other up but like i really appreciate his insight as a as a dad and as a dude and as a son but but he makes me giggle harder than anyone so doing a podcast is fun so there's something on a podcast that's performative for you with him and then there's a part being him because we're trying to make each other laugh but i'll tell you if we're going back to drinks i'll tell you like a great a great afternoon drink is a campari spritz it's my one of my favorite drinks in the world i don't even know what that is oh campari spritz campari is an interesting alcohol because i think it's a bitter or it's a liqueur and it's got a weird rooty earthy taste it's red so it looks like kool aid that's why i got into it i thought campari on ice would be oh so nice it's a old commercial but man it's fucking like sucking the green giant's dick it is earthy what's earthy it's like it's it tastes like roots it's just oh nice it's not it's not it's oh there's a bitterness and like a it's just not great and then someone introduced me to a negroni which is campari and gin and a little soda water and then campari spritz campari spritz is campari prosecco and soda water mhmm in like a wine glass and it is so enjoyable it's got so many different profiles to it where you get the bitterness but the sweetness of the prosecco and then it flattens it out with the soda water and it looks like kool aid so i love it that's one of my favorite drinks to share in what context oh you're in italy and you've been walking around venice and everyone went their own ways and the whole family comes back together and you meet at a statue and and your wife's sweating and she's uncomfortable mhmm and your daughters are sixteen and eighteen and they're like what are we gonna what are we doing with the rest of the day and you go hey guys it's europe mhmm does anyone want a campari spritz and everyone goes i don't know what that is and you go for campari spritz that so it's minor in alcohol so it's not gonna light them up but it gives them a little bit of a buzz where they're like dad these are nice isla didn't drink hers so i drank hers i georgia had hers leanne had hers and we ordered another round i ordered an and they're fucking refreshing and the buzz is perfect it's not too much because it's just a little bit of champagne and some campari if the buzz is perfect and then a couple of them and then they kinda disappear and then you're just walking around again that's a great fucking drink do you have a drink alone so there's two kinds of alone one is alone like at a bar oh we there's other people but they're strangers right yeah they're kinda like out there k i've done that keep going yeah keep going tell walk me through all the alones and i'll and then i'll tell you the rest all kinds there's all kinds of there's a alone on a train we're transporting stuff along the train yeah train plane and then there's just alone in a in an empty home or a hotel room hotel office and it's sunday night sunday night and you're packing your bag and you got a flight at six am yeah but roadhouse is on and you're like shit so you get out of the front desk and go is the bar still open and they go yeah can i order something to take to my room sure how about six heinekens six heinekens yeah my wife wanted one too she's not up there you murdered her and you just say to yourself i'm just getting six so that if i have four i i just know i have two extra ones and then you go through six and you're like oh man i'm not done yet dude i've drank in every alone scenario you can possibly think of i've drank i've drank alone in a helicopter with a dude who didn't know i was drinking he was like i was like can i drink in here and he's like absolutely not and then i poured it in a flask and opened it and drank it and he's like dude we're in a fucking helicopter you don't think i can smell that mhmm i've the best alone drinking you can ever do in my opinion now we're getting into the weeds on it mhmm is alone behind someone's back what do you mean like when they don't know you're drinking but you're drinking like like christmas shopping and and your wife says alright let's all split up and you go cool and it's like it's it's like eleven o'clock on a sunday and they just opened that bar by the elevator in the beverly center and you just sneak over and you go hey man can i get a double jack on the ross fox for ross and they're like sure and you just have it and you just go let's just and then you're off and then you're like yeah yeah and then you just little sneak one sneak it sneak it and then you're and then buzzed and nobody knows and then your wife's like wait have you been drinking you're like do i yeah i'm drinking by myself in a fucking mall yeah on christmas how sad do you think i am and then you go yeah i am what about mood do you ever drink in a in a dark place so i broke i i had a chick breakup or a chick cheat on me when i was when i came back from russia and she slept with my best friend and i didn't know how to deal with the emotions i had and my buddy mike osborne said i can tell you this if you drink they go away and i went okay and that was the first and kind of last time i ever did that because i did it i've done it i've done it a couple times but it i try to avoid i try to avoid if there's emotion going to alcohol like meaning not when it's anxiety but like depression yeah i kinda sit in the depression because or anxiety i lean towards alcohol like anxiety like about flying or or or just like getting worked up on over something but with depression i try to avoid alcohol and just sit in it because i i because i've gone there before i've but anxiety is up i land i land all the time but depression heartbreak all that you just sit in the feeling yeah heartbreak's a weird one for me so like the last time i got my heart broken leanne dumped me mhmm we were dating for like four months and she broke up with me and my instinct was to have a drink my friends went to this this middle eastern restaurant and i told them what was going on and my buddy corey was like let's get a cocktail and i was like i don't want one i gotta figure this out because i want this chick and if i start drinking i'll be like yeah fuck it so i gotta figure it out like i i wonder i'm gonna find out my dad dies one day or my mom but my dad will be the rough one my mom will be equally as rough my dad and i are really close and i wonder if i've thought about this a lot if i'll have a drink dealing with that like i i think about that a lot i keep saying everything i get with my dad is extra my dad my dad had a a hundred percent blockage in his widowmaker twice and both times they saved his life and he got a stint i think twelve or thirteen years ago and then he just got a stint this last year but so i everything i get to do i feel like is extra and so you know he was just at the premiere of my movie and he got to see that and he had a very emotional response and i got i got that from him and i was like that that's a little ice on the cake i did you know the arena in tampa was the first time he ever saw me do stand up that was like a little extra so all these things i'm getting with them are all extra so i have you know and he's seventy four so yeah if if that'll be a tough one well at the premiere he was what proud yeah he came out he was sobbing crying and he goes i've underestimated you your whole life and i was like what and he's like and he just and he was shaking yeah he goes i just underestimated you i didn't know i didn't know you'd i didn't know you were this i didn't whatever it it was really hard to understand him to be honest with you i don't know totally what he said he might have just not liked the movie i i think you were hearing what you wanted to hear what'd you learn about life from your father it's not gonna make sense i wanna feel like sometimes i'm like a professional fucking wrestler because all i care about is you you come and see me do stand up so i'd whatever i gotta do to get you there but the number one thing my one takeaway from that man's humility and i applied i've applied it in different ways throughout my career on my twenty sixth birthday he gave me a really aggressive speech he i i was hungover and i just thought he was gonna say go happy birthday so i picked up the phone and i was like hey and he was like you are a tremendous piece of shit and then he broke me off you have no humility you have no this you have no never succeeded in anything you you're you're lying to yourself you're lying to everyone around you you're not doing what you're going after your dream i broke you i failed you as a father this and that i was like i thought you're gonna wish me happy birthday and so in that speech he told me if i wanted something i had to go at it and i had to go after it as as hard as i could and i had to do whatever it could i i could do to achieve that in this case it was working offering to do anything at the comedy club to get on stage he told i told him that that's not how it works and he said no that's that's how it works for some poor kid from harlem because that kid needs it he goes you've grown up with privilege your whole life you don't need it you think you're gonna be fine and so i went and i ended up getting a job out the door but i it was it was it was it's humbling it's it's really like it's it's makes me feel it made me feel uncomfortable and so that humility is it's the first time i really understood humility and i've applied that in many respects in like in like getting to be a a paid regular at the comedy store that happened late in life for me which i think most people would give up and be like fuck that i'm i'm already a touring comic i'm on tv i don't need that but it's something i wanted and i knew i wanted so i i just humbly went after it and then i think i i i still apply it when it when it comes to selling tickets or or or or selling a project to to fans or even to doing podcasts i try to be as honest as i can about whatever i'm going through or whatever i'm dealing with but when it comes to like selling things i don't have i don't have a problem trying to make fun of myself or or get in front of people so that they know that that i have a show because i the thing i'm good at the the one thing i know i'm good at is stand up and and i i say that humbly but like i want them to come there so like i've heard people make fun of me like before they're like yeah i'm not some i'm not some clown in a speedo who's want who's gonna i'm a real comic and i go okay but i'm i wanna i want them at my shows and you can be that guy and i'll be this guy yeah the clown in the speedo yeah it's like what are you gonna do funny people make fun of me for taking my shirt off like i guess behind my back no one ever does it to me like no one would ever comics aren't comics aren't comics aren't that manly yeah yeah but i always go like i always go like who what do you care what am i what do you do i what do you care and you love taking your shirt off more than anything you know when something becomes a meme and becomes super popular it it becomes easy to not love the thing anymore to get tired of it you still love it well more than anything i like being shirtless more than having a shirt i'm very uncomfortable in a shirt yeah like right now and i have tactile issues like i have legit tactile issues i'm most comfortable in stretchy jeans mhmm with a loose fitting belt and then these shirts exactly but i don't i'm i like more like a v neck i feel i can feel this on my neck right now and i can feel it on my arms mhmm and so i'm i'll sit a certain way because it i it it just rubs me wrong but yeah i'm more comfortable shirtless i can never wear what you're wearing yeah well this is my shirtless we each of us have to find our place in this world yeah in terms of fashion i would love to be able to wear what you wear yeah because it looks good it feels like an escape from convention with you or me both of us yeah because i this nobody wears this unless you work security for somebody yeah but it looks good on you does it i don't know you know i think people think i don't know like they would say like what what if you lose weight you can't take your shirt off anymore go no i can fucking take my shirt off yeah you're fucking out of your mind i'm gonna take my shirt off all the time you mentioned early on heartbreak after the russia trip with a girl who slept with your friend let's go back to hemingway quotes the best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them so to go all in with the trust i love hemingway so much have you been betrayed in your life yeah what do you think about trust that's an interesting question i've been betrayed in my professional life a couple times by really close friends and i'm not someone who can like i have a mantra that i mean i'm i don't know if people have heard it or not and i'm i hate i hate sharing it but it's but it's true the mantra is so you think i'm weak like do you think it's like that's my thing so i i feel like people take advantage of me and i go oh so you think i'm weak you forget everyone that like the the when i'm named the the people that have betrayed me i'm a larger man than all of them and and but i and so that's what really fucks with me as i go so you think i'm weak like where i grew up when you do stuff there was physical consequences i grew up in florida like i've i've been beaten up a bunch i'm not saying i can fight but like i'm i'm not scared of getting beaten up and the the times that i've been betrayed i and and and even i i know even like by ari whichever people see that drugging as a betrayal and i did for a period but it was it was only because it was ari and he was my one of my best friends and me and him had to work through that because i i i couldn't not love him like i couldn't not have him in my life he he means a lot to me he really does he's a great friend to have but he's also i don't know what was going on with him at that time but he made a bad decision and i had to forgive him for that because i knew he he knew my mantra mhmm i think i'm harder to trust people now i'm i'm not as apt to trust people at all but there was a moment i i don't know if i've ever shared this and i don't know how this will sound but there was a moment that information got leaked about a thing and all my managers and agents both both tom and my tom and our managers and agents would like to separate either separate us mhmm or one of us one of them get both of us it's just more lucrative for them sure so they have always kind of pitted us against each other a little bit and they do it subtly mhmm they'll do it to me and and my team and then his team will do it to me and then my team will do it to him and his team will do it to him and there was a moment where information got leaked about this thing i was doing and my team was like just so you know your your boy tommy is is the rat mhmm and i had to it was the one time and leanne said do you think tom would do that i said i don't know how faith works like i'm not a super religious person but i will tell you that i believe in tom and i don't think he did it and i will stand by that ignorantly and and i will and i will ride or die with him because i cannot live in a world where i don't trust him yeah if i don't trust him then i am so fucked and and it wasn't him it wasn't him and it was it's a cool feeling to know that you could like that you could blindly trust someone blindly have faith in someone know that they're they have your best interest at heart but yeah it took me a while to get there rogan helped me get there because i wasn't trusting him or joey or tommy or anyone i wasn't trusting anyone i've gotten in a bad thing and i just wasn't trusting anybody and rogan was like yeah man we're trying to be your fucking friend and i was like yeah i don't i don't need friends i couldn't understand what why rogan was interested in me and i was i said to like someone was like is he gay like what the fuck yeah and then he was just a nice guy he was just a nice guy that'd be hilarious if joe was sexually attracted to you this whole time this whole time is the reason he keeps inviting you back i would be more excited i would be more excited if just if he tried to kiss me on the lips once just and just and a like an going in a scotty scotty jay way from boogie nights where he's like what do you like my car yeah you know nobody would believe that story no one yeah if i was joe i would kiss dudes all the time and then be like and then and then when they didn't kiss back oh you know one will never no one will ever believe you yeah well when you trust people like that and they fuck you over that can really really really hurt you end up on a treadmill in a hotel room fighting with them you fight with them all the time you fight with them all the time you fight with them constantly and it's and i and i i have this thing like where i go ruminate on an idea and i can't get it out of my head and i hear the words they say and i and then i and so all in your head on a treadmill in your head just fighting just fucking fighting and then yeah and then one day you get past it like one day you just go fuck them i'm not gonna let you give them real estate and then you just forget about them and then they reach out and they'll they'll try to be a dick or a bully because they're bullies they're bullies is what they are don't ever forget it they're fucking bullies and they got bullied it's not their fault they got bullied and then they try to bully you and you're and you don't have any connection anymore and you're like oh you can go fuck yourself you can actually go fuck yourself you're not my boss you're not my wife you don't fuck me you don't pay me get the fuck out of my life but this kind of mantra of the you're not weak you still wanna be able to be fragile to the world and appear weak almost i am i am i mean that's the problem is i think i am pretty fucking weak like i'm not the i'm not the strongest dude out there i have really thin skin i get my feelings hurt all the time yeah and so but like but it sucks when you watch like your friend see something in you that you go or do they go fuck him he's not paying attention fuck him let's just fuck him let's take his money you know what fuck him he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing look he's a drunk alcoholic and you go oh no bitch i pay attention like i'm i'm i'm wide awake i'm here i'm working my ass off you're not gonna fucking well that's the tough thing about like you and tom segura you're at the top of your game on top of the world some of the most famous comics in the world and you could see money start to creep in like business decisions yeah i don't know it's a tough it's a tough place it's really tough it's really tough for you know especially as we're growing and and i'll tell you what it i don't know how much i'm allowed to say but i can tell you this we had a business deal where feelings were getting involved and money was involved in that and the money was causing the feelings and one of us said to the other person our feelings are more important than the money mhmm so let's just split the money mhmm and it was and it was and it was and and and it was it was really like a solid moment where i where both of us were like that is how we should run this yeah that's the interesting things like with bands you have like popular bands that split and even yeah even though it's clear that the contribution is not even it's like there's a front man and all that kind of stuff but it's ultimately the right thing to do to say fuck you to the money for the most part and prioritize the feelings yeah especially because like i couldn't do it without him he couldn't do it without me we do it separately we'll have guest bears on some will blow up some won't you can never figure it out but when we're together it does well mhmm and so we need each other for it to work and we've you know like i said we're on a handshake deal with two bears and no one likes that but we're like hey i mean we i don't like i to the point where i like he'll call me and go yo we have a deal to do this for for x amount are you in and i go yeah i don't check the books i don't need to i don't i don't i know him i just know him yeah what do you love most about tom segura the we saw a gay couple one time mhmm it was a good start and there was one guy who was in khakis and one guy was in jean shorts with a python around his neck yeah and tom goes if we were gay which one would you be i said i'm fucking python yeah and he was like yeah i'm khaki and i go really and he goes yeah that's why we work and he goes all relationships are pythons and khakis and i went really and he goes look at you and leanne who do you think you are i go i'm python and he goes she's khakis and he goes me and push i go oh she's python he goes and i'm khakis he goes i'll always be khaki and sometimes i'll have a relationship where i'm the python but it's i'm usually a khaki yeah and i was like yeah i am a little bit of a lunatic i i'll tell you the one of the the a moment that explains me and him that the world will never see it was just a great moment we got stem cells with rogan one weekend yep one day and i'd had surgery in my arm and ty didn't wanna do it i was terrified and tom just said just come out and meet up with us tom knew he was gonna make me get them mhmm and so i got them and he you know joe's there and so we're just all talking yeah yeah yeah yeah and i'm and tom can see that i'm spinning out a little bit and i get in the car and you know tom's got a porsche so we're like right next to each other and i just wanna feel if it's swollen and it is a little swollen because i just got an injection and then and tom's driving and he's got his hand on the thing he just puts his hand on my arm and he goes you're okay he he just he's watching he knows me so well yeah that he knows that i'm spinning out of control he's like you're okay and then i was like and i felt okay i was like you're right i'm okay what the fuck fuck am i doing my brain's that brain man that guy got so much love in him dude he does he has you know he had a fantastic relationship with his dad and and and i think whatever that did that dude did to create that dude he headed out of the fucking park because he has so much love that he doesn't need reciprocated like at all like he can just love and then he it feels good for him to give mhmm and to like take care of someone and like you know he started the whole birthday gift thing because and he didn't need to he just was like hey man i had this bike i thought you'd like it and then of course i've turned it into a fucking bit and now we're upside down i'm one twenty upside down on a fucking race car that we can't make our money back on i love it what do you love most about joe rogan oh that dude i could go on and on about joe rogan joe rogan is the most selfless individual i've ever met he doesn't care if he has you on the podcast he wants you to be the funniest person in the room he wants you to be the smartest person in the room let me tell you something joe rogan is ten times smarter and funnier than me he wants you to shine he wants you he wants to put you over to his fans he that shit did not exist before he started doing his podcast people didn't share you with their fans no one was like hey man come on on the road with me they brought you on the road because they wanted you to suck and they put you in bad scenarios joe rogan wanted you to shine he gave he gave so many people beautiful career gave them careers gave them joe could have looked at his podcast as his thing this is my thing i bring on these guys i'm a be the funniest guy in the fucking room i know some guys that have done that might be me might be time i talk over people and not listen really well joe had did the opposite now look i've tried to learn from joe on my podcast and do the same that guy and when you think about it you name ten of his friends i i bet eight of them are doing arenas right now mhmm they're all doing theaters all his friends do theaters all his friends do theaters he is he is just you know i i i he and he won't accept this compliment i tried paying it to him in in austin when i was in austin last night well he's not gonna accept in compliments i gave him a gift too and i said hey i i need i need to show you i can't just tell you this because it's gonna fall in deaf ears i need to give you a minute so you have something so you know that i think about you and i'm grateful for having you in my life a lot for many reasons i have more friends in my life because of you he taught me how to trust people again i have a career because of you i have a major motion picture because of you i do arenas because of you without you and my life a lot of these these things maybe never would have happened i never would have told the machine on stage i wouldn't have gotten i wouldn't have never started a podcast i wouldn't have three podcasts like i mean all these things are are things he not just he didn't just take me to the water one time and give me a drink he he he gave me a machete and he said this is how i get to the water you gotta put cut your own path but just give me a heads up you can also use my path whenever you want i mean he he is the most selfless individual he will go down in history as one of the ten most important people in stand up comedy without a doubt he changed the game it didn't exist like this before him and and he won't accept that compliment what was the gift you gave him i can't tell you is it a dildo it was a dildo it was a double sided dildo i go hey when you get free time can we scissor fuck each other you're happily married for nineteen years so i think you're a good man to ask how do you find love how do you find how do you date in order to find the love of your life of a lifetime this is gonna sound off but don't don't tie yourself down meaning like don't spend time fucking with those little mini shrimp and peeling them every night mhmm when you know you're looking for a lobster yeah like and so i think what happens a lot of guys they just they're so busy and like just getting pussy and going from here to here to here yeah i was never that guy i always wanted i always wanted to find someone who understood me i always wanted that mhmm and so you know granted i haven't had sex with a lot of chicks but that's and it's and it's not by choice i'm not saying like maybe there was times i would have done it but i but i know that i was always looking for someone to figure out to get me and then and then i will say this when you know you know when you know you know when you think there's i can't imagine a life without this person that that that happened to me and i i can only say my experiences i had leanne i loved her and and i and i didn't even realize it and the second that she dumped me i went oh no no no no no oh i i don't get to live a great life without her she's the thing that's gonna give me a great life i knew it undisputed i i went for a run and she dumped me i went to my shower i cried i went to barnes and noble i bought men are from venus women are from mars i watched fight club in my closet i didn't drink i drank a lot of nyquil to sleep and then i went for a hike in in runyon canyon i was running back down outpost by benafleck's house and and the sun was setting and i just said god if you're listening just give me this check back i'll never fuck it up this is the one i won't fuck it up i won't cheat i'm not gonna be a bad dude i wanna have kids with her i'll be there i'll be a great fucking dude i'll take her out on dates like i'll love this chick and i got home and she was in my room in a sundress yeah and i was like oh fuck he i didn't know he was real yeah i was like shit man give me like one more night let me let me get some strange tale real quick yeah before i commit forever but i think when you know you know this is so silly but i follow that in business like when you know you know and like my assistant's with us and someone goes how did you how do you find a good assistant i go when you know you know like people will show you who they are i can tell you when i fell in love with my assistant we were doing a tv show and and and we worked past dinner and all the dinner places were closed yeah and he just said hey i got like four meals i didn't know which one you'd want so i got four different meals for you i ordered them they're up in your room and just let me know whichever you want i'll i'll take care of the rest of them yeah and i was like oh that that dude thinks about other people before himself he didn't even get himself dinner he just got me four dinners and i was like fuck yeah i i did the same thing with my my social media manager the way she was operating was i was like i feel like she's thinking about me yeah and we connected on so many levels on so many levels i could talk to her about things and ideas i had and then i was like okay i want her i want him i want i think you i think it's gotta be that thing when you know you know and it can be so simple as like like a personal trainer or like a a jujitsu class or like just where you go oh i'm connecting right now but you have to allow yourself to notice that personally you i i think you do i mean i think you have to put yourself out there and you have to be available for it you know that's the hardest part is just being available for it because so peep so many people just wanna be busy just dating yeah i just wanna have someone in my life i don't wanna be bored i don't wanna what if i die alone i don't wanna i i like just be available for it what is it you said peeling the baby shrimp yeah when you could be having a lobster lobster's still a lot of work i have to say yeah but well they yeah but it's lobster shit so this is a fucking baby shrimp or like and you ever get you ever get the ones in brazil where you just go fucking eat the shell i don't care anymore like you're so fucking hungry you just handful of lobster like it's popcorn or baby shrimp like it's popcorn i've done that in vietnam i've done that i where i just go it's too much work so when you're in it what's the secret to a successful marriage what what do women want bert kreischer oh fuck that's i'm the wrong guy to answer that i think how to make love to a woman by brooke kreischer how do you make love to a woman i'll tell you how i do it meh i go down on her first make sure she has an orgasm yeah and then i get my turn and that's over pretty quick it's like a it's like getting your ears pierced you'll feel a little prick and it's over yeah i i don't know if i've done a great job keeping her happy i think i keep her interested like i think i i i i keep her occupied like i'm like a a little bit of a rodeo clown mhmm like i don't know i mean like i i i know we're happy right now i know we're really happy but i don't know if i ever did as good a job as she did like she's always been like she's always been a gangster like done did everything just does everything she does it all she does everything like fucking everything and she loves it she just does it mhmm and then she shows love for you by taking care of you and so like i have a lot of time just been this like almost like step and repeat husband where it's like i come in to take a picture like hey monday tuesday alright i'm on the road wednesday take care guys or like travel channel i live for two weeks at a time i left for the movie for three months so like i don't know that i've ever done a bang up job i buy it like i i go i remember one time i was just like i don't cheat on her i don't hit her i don't yell at her i'm a pretty good fighter i'm a really good fighter like like i'm good at like going like hey we're on the same team oh you mean de escalation i'm really good at like i'm very self i'm very accountable i'm very self correcting like if if we're in a fight and she points something out and i go oh you're right i go fuck you're right about that you're right you're totally right oh in the moment in the moment i'm really good at that and my wife's not she's not a good apocalyzer like she needs to sleep on an apology and then she can do it i can apologize in the moment if i realize i'm wrong and i'm really quick to find my fault yeah i look for my fault because i go tell me what i did adversely as a parent i have pulled my daughters aside and been like yo that wasn't you that was mom yeah i'm giving you a heads up because i don't want because i i got really confused as a kid because my dad always made sure i knew i was wrong and sometimes i wasn't yeah and then as a kid you're kinda fucked up you're like well how do i know if i'm wrong i think that raises so i i was really good with my girls going like yo and then and then parenting georgia taught me a lot about self correcting self correcting was that my oldest i'd only probably parented like my dad parented like just like raise your voice get up to here that's it no that doesn't fuck this yeah how come the dogs don't have goddamn leashes on the collars on their necks and so with georgia i had to learn through therapy that if the if the if the consequence is here and it and the highest it goes is here then why the fuck wouldn't they lie and do everything because they go well i know what it's like to hear but if you can vary your consequence with a child and find some conversation in it mhmm then all of a sudden they're like well fuck well i don't wanna like this this does this does suck i i like this i like where we talk and he says write a thousand words on why driving around your kids in a car kids in a car is bad so threat and extreme violence every once in a while just to yeah let him know the dog can fucking bite yeah the dog can bark the dog can bite but if you pet him on his belly he'll wag its tail yeah do you worry about being away too much i mean you're one of the most creative content pushers and creators out there you're just constantly innovating constantly putting stuff out there but do you worry that pulls you away from like the mundane experience of life yeah that can bring contentment and happiness yeah i feel like sometimes it cannibalizes your real life where you start going you start thinking in promo videos or you start looking at a vacation as a bit yeah like we should go zip lining well ida why why don't you do what shoes are you wearing i like it can it can definitely cannibalize your life my wife's really good at going like no like no phones the girls are really good the girls when i started instagramming stuff they started saying stuff like dad hits mom and i'm like woah woah woah guys they're like no put your phone away yeah dad dad loves boys and i'm like woah woah woah woah stop stop stop stop stop yeah what's what are some secrets words of wisdom you can say for how to be successful online and all the everything you've learned you're kinda like the the mister beast of comedy just innovating constantly in terms of how to promote stuff in terms of how to present stuff across the different social media and across youtube podcasts all that stuff i think the number one thing is don't be afraid to suck no one sees the shit that sucks doesn't get views it just gets forgotten yeah gets forgotten the good stuff they remember and then that's all they bring up the stuff that sucks just goes away and they're like oh yeah did you do that i i don't even think i saw that fuck it who cares yeah you know it's like it's like i i watched i i one of my favorite stories about this is a guy named sean patton i was explaining instagram stories to him and ari and mark norman and i was explaining that you can set now sell tickets on instagram stories it was back when they swiped up instead of tap the button swipe up and they didn't understand it and i said let me show you and i put up tickets for sale and i said you know hey guys swipe up and then i just showed them in ten minutes look there's so many people swiped up it's a hundred and forty five people mhmm it's a lot of people to buy tickets for a fucking comedy club and they were like woah and then i go hey what do you do stories about i go fucking anything who gives a shit just anything and some things work some things don't and i watched sean patton shout out to sean patton try for about fifteen minutes to do an instagram story about his cup of tea mhmm he was making cup of tea and he was making it and he kept going hey you got okay hold on fuck hold on let me yeah i was filming him from the couch yeah i was filming all these attempts the whole thing yeah i filmed every single one of my like fifteen different stories of him trying to do that i had a hundred and forty five thousand views on each story mhmm he never posted it he never posted it and i was like i was like man if he had just posted that one he never posted anything in his stories yeah that one a hundred forty five five thousand people would have gone to his story to see that cup of tea being made and see which one he finally went with and so sometimes i think the biggest mistake you can make is just not doing it just do it just post it turn the camera on the idea will show up and that that's the number one thing just turn the camera on and it'll come up you'll figure it out do you do multiple takes or no maybe i do three like and i'm talking even like in the with the dance video i did where i did the hip hop dance i did two takes on that mhmm with where i've had the marching band come to my house i did two takes on that once you start doing more takes you you lose the fun of it i think and and then the fun ones i mean my favorite one i've ever done without a doubt my favorite promo i've ever done is i needed they added a second show in some city and and and they added a second show like friday and saturday and or third show and i said i they just told me i was like fuck i'm leaving like tomorrow i need to sell tickets so i said real quick girls meet me outside and leanne's like girls are doing homework i'm gonna take five seconds i put on a speedo i got the american flag i gave ila the hose i gave leanne the leaf blower and i gave georgia the drone mhmm and i just had georgia drone it back to reveal the leaf blower and the the mist you were seeing was coming from isla and leanne yeah i'm gonna speed up with american flag i have bob seager playing rambling gremlin man yeah and and that night larry the cable guy texted me and he goes this is fucking genius and i was like it was just and it was just like yo just let's just shoot something who gives a fuck like just shoot something just just just say something and and and and put a little just do a little movement into it and mhmm and those are my back in the i used to be i watched a bunch of my promo clips back from back in the day i used to be really good now it's like i'm promoting so fucking many things i'm just like i'm almost like i'm exhausted about my promotions yeah because you know the the well can dry up in terms of ideas yeah and it's like how many times am i gonna show a picture of my ass my ass sells really good that's whatever my ass is on instagram fucking million views guaranteed a million views your ass and and and and enter and it's and it's an active post like people are like i did the best one i did the other day was where i superimposed my ass on my front mhmm and it just looked beautiful yeah no views oh so you i think it got reported oh i see it looked like a front vagina oh is that what it was yeah i think so but like but yeah my ass abs styles like i'm i'm at a place right now where i am promoting i'll be promoting this movie i'll be promoting this movie until it goes to a streamer mhmm i'll be promoting it shamelessly i am proud of it i i had a great time shooting it it's in theaters it'll be on video on demand it'll be on the streamer i'm sure i don't know but i'm sure i'm promoting fully loaded my summer festival with nineteen different comics i'm promoting the tops off world tour that starts again this fall i'm promoting my cruise the fully loaded cruise i'm promoting red rocks i'm promoting so many things that today was the very first time in my career where i said in january i'm gonna take a break i'm gonna take a break and go like hey man let's let's get your resting heart rate down yeah let's let's get some sleep let's let's maybe take off like three months from drinking like let's just really like slow it down and and and also not think when you're thinking in promo all the time it it can be a little exhaust i mean you think you think it's exhausting to look at my feed it's exhausting to be my feed i'm my feed yeah and sometimes less is more one of the things that nope nope one one of the things that inspires me about rogan for example is he almost never does this kind of stuff yeah yeah and how seldom he does his podcast because you write less is more how what does he do like once a month yeah no he does it three times a fucking week yeah less more is more is perfect but for example when he does like a story or something like this yeah he does one take it's kinda shitty it's it's the same take it's the same it's elk with a bunch of jalapenos a knife that he had sent to him by a fucking knife maker and him going look at this look at this traeger smoker i reverse seared this this this is what's great look at this i'm about to put in the butter and like this is grass fed butter this is really raising my testosterone rogen is it's you're right with guys like rogen when he does do a story they're a little precious yeah and there's i don't think he's he's ever done a a second take on any of those stories no there's i'd you have to really admire that like if the shot is framed poorly if the audio sucks doesn't matter doesn't matter when he this is like like i can get in the weeds on rogan but and especially when it's instagram do you remember when he got his polar plunge and he couldn't sit it in a minute mhmm and then the next day yep and then he must have gotten it on the internet bad yeah he must have gotten it bad yeah the next day he sat there for twenty minutes and he lowered his core temperature by like two degrees and it took him like a month to get that back yep that is that fucking man what an interesting you know it's i told you at the beginning we were just talking i like i really enjoy i draw inspiration for men i'm not like mhmm you david goggins cam haines mhmm andrew huberman roberto huberman i love fucking i mean there's so many guys like that rogen you know tim kennedy like there are a lot of guys that are like just very different men than me and i love jocko wilnick mhmm like i love i love reading their stuff or listening to their audiobooks or what listen to their podcast because i'm so not like that mhmm but that to for me when i add a little bit of that in my life like i remember you went to i don't know what you were doing but you were walking us through your day mhmm and it was so fascinating it was like it was like i i ran eight miles today i listened to an audiobook i was running eight miles and then i came and i worked for about three hours straight on ai stuff and i'm like and i was like wait you sat at a desk like you like sat at a desk and like and i i actually i wouldn't even know what to do i i would start doing crafts like i wouldn't like to that you went i was like is your computer like yeah have you sat for like four hours focused on a single task me yeah no no oh i have a hard time sleeping for four hours yeah like i i i don't have that i i don't have a brain that like i i really admired it when i listened to you do it because then you were like you're taught you were fasting at the time you're doing your fast and then you talk about what you ate mhmm and i i was jealous i wanted to be able to be like that and i think at that time we started i think you're doing maybe bone broth or something mhmm and we started doing bone broth pretty religiously and and adding that into a fast because i was like it does for someone like me it does feel cool to add a little bit of control into life mhmm so you life so integrating a little bit of a way of being from another person that you're not like yeah like like like so so david goggins is consistently pushing himself i love i did it i did it over the pandemic more but i love to go in today i'm running a marathon i'm gonna get on the treadmill and it's it's not gonna be all at once but i'm a get through a marathon today so let's get up give us six pumps some coffee and let's see if we can do like five miles and then know that we started there and that was really fun to to to to like cam haines does that too where he goes like he almost just sets the limit and then and then achieves that his son truett is really fascinating because his son truett right now is trying to get the and like i bet people would never think that this is who i watch but i get real inspiration from those people because i showed jocko i showed a clip to jocko to ayla because ayla's like me like like a a person of her fluids mhmm impulse i i walked in on her one time she was in the pantry in a bathrobe in the dark drinking a root beer yeah and i opened the door and she went i said what she goes i thought you were mom shut the door and i shut the door to let her finish the root beer yes she has a hard time waking up so i go i looked i'm in here i want you to see this clip from jocko she goes who's jocko i said he's a navy seal she goes he works at the zoo i went no he goes he's a navy fucking seal i go it's a badass job she goes it's a silly name and i went no it's not it isn't a silly name these guys are the toughest dudes in the world mhmm she goes she's kinda right though about the silly name i never even realized that well yeah you talk to a child yeah and so i go watch this what he says about waking up so he hits the thing and jaco goes first thing you do when you hear that alarm clock you could roll over you could go back to bed you could just snooze but you get out of bed and that's your first victory and isla hits pause and she goes how great is that nap right after you hit snooze though i went it is pretty funny i go hang on it is great you're missing the point you've been missing this whole speech he's with casey neistat when he's telling this speech he's with casey neistat yeah and so i hit it and then he goes and then you've got a victory under your belt then you go to the gym and you work out and i go you listen to this island she goes yeah and he goes and then when you go to the work now you've got two victories you've worked out and you've woken up on time you didn't hit that snooze button so when you go into that break room and you see donuts and she hits pause she goes if he's about to say no to donuts i'm done listening i go he's definitely gonna say no to donuts do you think he's gonna have a donut and she goes you like this guy i go i fucking love him and she goes do you think he'd like you and i go what do you mean she goes dad you hit snooze you skip working out and you love donuts and i'm like yeah you're making a good fucking point i go i but i but i do love that like i love to watch that brain work and go like like i don't i don't hit snooze like i don't hit snooze now i go fuck it because i'm up but i and and then and then i go to the gym every single morning i go to the gym every single morning and today is national donut day i didn't have a donut and so like i i like i i like try to apply these a little bit because i i mean the other side of me is like tonight after we do this i'll do another podcast and then i'm gonna call leanne and go yo we're in beverly hills meet me out here mhmm let's go have drinks let's go have fucking couple capari spritz let's i was over at a friend's house in overnight let's get some edibles and let's fucking have a night about it yeah get some sushi go have sex in the hot tub and i gotta work out at fucking ten in the morning i gotta tell you that nap when you press snooze is the sweetest that's that's my victory first victory is pressing snooze and getting the nap onto the belt i have you ever had i had so this this morning i didn't work i didn't work out i had pressed at like five in the morning until about six you're going hard right now yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm moving and then i had apoxies flew to austin was like what yeah what just run around theaters and now you're back yeah run around theaters to do to promote the movie and then look you only get one shot at these movies so you might as well do and look it's really hard to get people to go into a movie theater right now mhmm and so i woke up at like six did or five or six to seven did press and then i went and i said and i'm really into podcast history podcast right now mhmm and i was listening to this one about the conquistadors and i was and i was like when i woke up i was like i wouldn't mind going back to that and i said i'll tell you what i'm gonna take a little nap and go now i slept good last night i slept like seven hours last night boy that thirty minute nap it felt like five hours mhmm and i woke up going i gotta readjust my sleep score that has to be a ninety seven that was the best fucking nap those little snooze naps are monsters you know there's i don't care that's probably for me one of the peak experiences of life is those naps i don't know what that is have you ever slept in a tour bus a tour bus versus a regular bus like a tour bus like meaning like in a bunk no i've taken a lot of buses in my life though like you mean like just like a like a grande ground those are very different and like a chance listen they okay it's just part of part of life in a greyhound i was on a greyhound one time one time right when notorious b i g album came out in college mhmm and i was going from tallahassee down to tampa and the dude got on the tour bus got on the bus next to me black dude and he sat down he said where you headed and i said tampa he said you grew up in tampa i said yeah i said you and he goes yeah i i said you go to school with fam and because famu and florida say the two schools one's black one's white he goes no i just got a prison i said you got a prison and he goes yeah yeah man i got out of prison i stabbed the dude and and and i've been in prison i just got out today he goes what are you listening to i said no notorious b i g and he goes oh shit that's out and i went yeah and he goes i wanna hear it can i hear it and i was like yeah and he used my headsets the whole bus ride to tampa i didn't have the i was like he's stabbed a man they're yours now yes and then i just sat next to him and like is it you're enjoying it he's like this is good no tour bus snaps yeah when you're in a bunk it's ice cold bus isn't moving five o'clock you like we work out from like up until like five o'clock five thirty show starts at seven but that five o'clock to six six thirty nap is pitch black it's like a coffin mhmm and it is ice cold and you got all your pillows and blankets in there and you put a little history podcast on in the corner and you just listen to like kurt mumbashi or or like oh my god so you're talking about like five six pm for seven pm show oh it's the best nap you'll ever have you wake up so refreshed yeah like i've woken up from naps like where i'm like fuck yeah like they're those those tour bus naps are the best naps yeah i think having a full productive day mhmm and then like five six pm you do a nap and then you do something really stressful after that like really high performing like like a show but if i do like i i really like doing podcasts like late at night after a nap i think i fucked up my podcast rhythm because they were doing them in the day yeah and so sometimes i'm just like i like if i work out in the morning i'm good on a podcast but if i don't work out i suck on a podcast and i'm just like uh-huh yeah yeah that's cool no i i my favorite is i used to do this a lot i haven't done it in a while is full busy day nap at home mhmm box of wine on the treadmill and do that until like midnight or watching tv box of wine box of wine on a treadmill it's the best how are you wait how are you sipping it jake you you have a glass but but you have a box the box fits on the corner on the treadmill so you just got a little spigot yeah and you just sit there and just put on like guys' grocery games or like just some just like a you're walking or are you running i walk i walk at like a three five so what'll happen is if you start at three start at three casual walk twenty minutes you get a mile in and then you and you're gonna feel loose mhmm get up to a three five you can do seven miles on these things and just and just and you're just enjoying your night especially like my wife back in the day when we lived in our old house my wife would come into the man cave and she'd sit on the couch and we'd watch tv together yeah and like watch game of thrones and you just like for an hour and you just get on the treadmill and do it oh man i'd i loved haven't done that as much lately that was the fucking thing lose yourself you can forget yourself you forget you're on a treadmill yeah and you just start like walking and you're sweating and you're and you're having wine and then at a certain points you're like like you'd like you you start jogging especially like are we watching not all quiet on the restroom front what's the one where they've gotta they've gotta get the message to the frontline i would run like i was in world war two yeah i would run when they would run and it was fucking awesome and i would be like because they were doing drinks i'd be like take a drink you gotta run up there and i'd be like okay yeah i'm really into i'm really into history podcast right now like i've been in them for a while twentieth century or everything everything everything i listened to was it marcus aurelius and cleopatra mhmm today in the middle of the podcast they're like you know just so you know cleopatra wasn't as hot as everyone says i was like why are you saying that yeah tell me she's a six she looks like snooki yeah like i why let me let me dream that she looked like kim kardashian yeah and then i listened to that one today i listened to world war two a lot oh a lot of books on world war two a lot of podcasts about it what's your favorite theater the pacific or or european no european pacific well because my family is so much of it has died in that theater so dude it's personal so much of it i i hate to sound cliche like a arnold schwarzenegger in an eighties movie but it's personal keith well you know what i find funny about that yeah is lenin it was lenin right john lennon or no no no no no was it lenin was we're we're two right or is it stalin stalin stalin stalin yeah stalin thought him and hitler would be friends yeah i think that's so cute that he was like we're gonna be buddies yeah like we're boys yeah and then hitler's like oh fuck you yeah i'm hitler bro this is what i do well at first he was like fuck yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we'll be friends yeah yeah sure sure and then call me call me better yet i'll show up in winter how's that sound yeah the that that i find i find all of that so so fascinating when i was a kid i had a hard time understanding how because we were always at war with russia when i was a kid and i had a hard time understanding how we could be on the same team as russia in world war two and i was like wait how did that turn south and then you guys listen to podcast yeah i'm i'm that all of that all of that like all of the world war two i i got really into the the pacific shit for a while but i'm really deep in the in in the whole we we we went to normandy from the the cliffs of dover mhmm and to think so that's the fucking beach that's the fucking beach oh shit this is cold as fuck mhmm these dudes jumped in ice cold water yeah and this isn't like a cool beach like this is and it's just so insane to and then to see like the the it's pretty intense i i don't know why i got into history late in life i wasn't i was kind of into it but i'm really into it now and i love just learning a little something about you know today was i listened to like the noiser has a great history stuff it's like history for dummies i think like i get to i can't listen to the really smart stuff it starts losing me too many names and i'm gone yeah well dan carlin is always the best your podcast with dan carlin yeah was so fucking good yeah he is he is i mean i only know about martin luther because of dan carlin i only know like i would've i made a joke about some lutheran the other day and everyone laughed and i was like did you guys listen to the same podcast i did because i just am quoting dan carlin that his podcast i mean we all quoted the same shit about genghis khan about how he could shoot a dove off a horseback but we knew that all four hoofs had to be off the ground at the same time they shot they would sometimes take their meat and stick it under their saddles and that i mean dan carlin is he is the motherfucker yeah god those were man discovering podcast was the coolest time of my life and the interesting thing about him is is audio and so it's the voice so for me i mean everybody has a story with a prostitute in a motel dan carlin was my prostitute in the mot i invite him to a motel i don't even remember in the middle of nowhere he shows up with that voice and the rest the rest is history so good things that we'll never know what happened you oh boy did he like no i'm just kidding i'm i'm i'm really running with this yeah yes we did we got along with it i mean he's an incredibly kind and thoughtful person constantly self critical thinking he's not good enough he just works on those episodes forever forever and he just thinks that there's these just like with goggins there's these other historians that i think like weigh on him like they're going to judge him or something like this in his mind i i talked about i talked to him about daniel patelian and i guess his thing is he i get i guess his his hang up is carlin's is he's not a he he's not like this like he doesn't feel like he's a real historian yeah but he is yeah i mean he's it's the way he shares the story look we had a history teacher in seventh grade who's a con artist and he came and taught our seventh grade and it it was told con artist all he taught us about was barnstorming barnstorming and the jfk assassination i walked away having such an appreciation for barnstorming a very small blip on americana but i know a lot about barnstorming because of this guy and he because he was passionate about barnstorming it was the funnest seventh grade history class i'll ever take in my entire life you mentioned tour bus what's the best road trip you've been on have you have you driven across the country just you no we had one road trip in college where a bar had burned down and we found out that the alcohol was still in the bar yeah so we took my jetta yeah over to the bar and we emptied out the bar of all the burnt up liquor we didn't know what anything was we threw it into the trunk with no clothes like no no clothes and we said let's just start driving and we drove from tallahassee and ended up in west virginia and just just drove just drove it was like five dudes we drank one person drove i i i wasn't a big and this sounds kinda crazy i wasn't a big drinker in college until i went to russia mhmm and so i drove the majority of the way and then we we get somewhere and and we get a hotel room and it was one of the most epic fucking weekends of just debauchery and chaos and i think we took mushrooms and we we we we went down a river in tubes so it's mostly about the bond between the five people versus dudes versus like throwing yourself into meeting like strangers and this kind of stuff yeah and it was when it was when i was like i was i was trying to be a poet at that time and so like we were actual poetry yeah it was a really bad part of my life i was just yeah i tried to be in a band too that didn't work out the way i wanted it to i just was never i always was i was never the i'm not a good serious person like i'm a good funny person i'm good to be the fool but i'm not good when i try to be serious it looks foolish and so even like you know someone said showed me throwing out the first pitch the other day as something and all i could see is my gut flying everywhere and i was like that's why it went viral i was like fuck i thought it was my throwing style that was a pretty epic one the best road trips i ever took was during the pandemic during the pandemic when we were when when we would we're doing that drive in movie theater tour mhmm i created a drive in movie theater tour when no one was working and the very first one we all no one had left our houses we all went to my house we got my tour bus we had just wrapped the day the tour bus showed up we just wrapped the cabin just wrapped doing the cabin on netflix and we got covid tested we got in the tour bus and we said let's create our bubble and stay safe and that night we drove i think just outside gallup mhmm and we stayed in a and no one had been outside and we stayed at a at a at a koa camp on arrival and we watched thunderstorms come in on a lake and we were all smoking cigars and drinking ipas and and it was fucking and that whole road trip we road tripped across the country to start the tours mhmm and then we just and we were outside for the first time and we were and it was that period of my life i'm so grateful i didn't make a ton of money because we had a big crew and i've made sure i was trying to make sure everyone can because no one had paid bills in a while but that fucking tour was the funnest we took up pickleball we took up disc golf everything was wide open in the middle of the country you could do things but we were still in our bubble and we lived in that tour bus and at the at night we just get back in the tour bus by ourselves and get fucking wasted and and i mean that fucking run it'll nothing will ever be like that yeah because you like rediscovered the humanity the camaraderie because the pandemic kinda killed that they suffocated us from like the basic connection yeah and then and and there was this you always had an anxiety attack halfway through that you got covid this one you know covid was killing people and you were like i i know i've got covid and then and then we'd come in to sedona and this is also why i didn't make a ton of money we'd come into sedona and we get a house in sedona for five days an airbnb and we'd all isolate there before we went home to our families yeah i remember i remember i remember the first time we did it we didn't isolate we just pulled back into la and all our families were freaked out so i had to stay live on the tour bus in at a different house and it was fourth of july and i came in and they were doing an egg toss and they're like well you can do an egg toss and this is how bad my anxiety gets you can do an egg toss with your daughter isla so isla and i did an egg toss and we fucking got it to like legit like forty fucking feet where i was throwing overhand lobbing them to her and the egg cracked in her hands and it broke over her face and i got in bed that night high on weed fucking drunk and i went what if i gave my daughter covid from an egg toss i go that would be the most horrific way to kill a child she got it from an egg toss it broke in her face her dad did covid yeah i mean that that's the scariest thing about covid i think is not you dying but because of you somebody else dies oh i got it that feel that's that that's the fear i think that really like took hold on people that's why they're they were way more cautious than perhaps they needed to be it's just like i don't wanna be the guy that's responsible for killing somebody i love or somebody that somebody else loves my leanne gave everyone in our family covid she came up to me and she gave me a hug yeah after christmas and gives me a hug and i said what's the matter and she goes i think i have covid i go bitch six feet yeah the fuck are you doing yeah back it up fauci like fucking and then she we went well then we went off and then and then she had it and it went away and we're all fine and we're like okay we're like we can still go to park city so we all go to park city then georgia gets covid and then georgia starts crying and she goes i think i gave you covid and i was like i'm fine she goes you're at high risk and i'm like what she's like you're a fat alcoholic i'm like woah easy where the fuck what about feelings yeah and then georgia got covid me and i live were still in park city leanne had it my tour bus came up picked georgia up georgia and leanne took him back to la and i was i and i were there and i tested and then we get on the plane and i i cough and ayla's got her mask on ayla just looks at me you know the best the one thing we miss are the eyes over masks yeah the the yeah and then we get home and i had covid and i was like if you gave me fucking covid and then she never got covid she never got covid you mentioned ipas what's the lay of the land of great beers in in this expansive world of ours i like pilsners i'm a pilsner guy i'm an ice cold beer guy ice cold pilsner i like a ice cold beer i like an ice cold one of the best beer buzzes i ever had is we had bought a new house but we weren't building it and i and over covid i didn't drink for like three months four months until we decided to go back out on tour and we figured that out and i was in the backyard and leanne came back with like two tall boy german pilsners and cracked them she goes let's have a beer and i was like fuck yeah and man that second that a beer buzz is different than anything yeah because the second it it touches you you feel the sparkle and you're just like yeah baby i'm back and then she's like you want another one i'm like fuck yeah and then we have another one and then and that beer buzz is especially afternoon beer buzz mhmm is just so pretty it's different than a night beer buzz a night beer buzz is like oh i guess we'll have a beer and then i'll have a couple i gotta go to work tomorrow alright yeah but that afternoon irresponsible beer buzz yeah pilsner pilsner there's i i don't mind an ipa but i it's gotta be at a it's gotta i gotta be at somewhere i gotta be at somewhere i they gotta have an ip like a like a local ipa mhmm there's gotta be food involved and then i'm enjoying an ipa i i i threw up an ipa in a bathtub in salt lake city one time it was a bath what do you mean oh you threw up in the bathtub okay no no no i was drinking in the bathtub like bathtub with some water in it or no no no no no you're sitting in the bathtub no i'm getting ready to take a shower and i had a growler of ipa yep it's about six in the morning yep i have to fly that day to vegas to jump off the stratosphere yeah all i need is a little bit of a buzz to get myself on this fucking plane yeah i have anxiety going through my fucking head because i'm jump i'm gonna be the first person to jump off stratosphere and so i'm drinking an ipa out of a growler in a bathtub at six in the morning and it just didn't sit right and i threw it up and i was off ipas for like ten fucking years yeah i didn't have another ipa until i was like forty six because i was like all i could think about was throwing up that ipa in a bathtub in a shower and being like i mean i'm a i'm a throw up thinking about it but yeah i don't i didn't fuck with ipas for a while and then during the pandemic i got it i got back into ipas i was that way with jack and coke jack daniels and coke really got so drunk many many years ago that just couldn't look at it i can't touch i can't touch what's janis joplin's drink southern comfort i can't touch southern comfort she just drink it straight well i but southern comfort is at forty percent that's hard no it's almost like a liquor honestly it's really sweet yeah jack jack double jack on the rocks lots of rocks yeah i may i had a quote that and i got a a video that went viral about i'll never quit drinking yeah and i have not gotten on a plane since that without having a flight attendant not even ask what i want walk up with a double jack on the rocks lots of rocks i mean it happens so on times i don't wanna drink yeah i flew to austin the other day i was like i'm not drinking on the plane because i felt sick yeah and man he walked up he goes double jack on the rocks rocks rocks i was like fuck you know it yeah but yeah that's that's my drink wait what's your drink i thought you'd be a vodka guy well vodka i associate with a lot of moments in my life of happiness because vodka is associated with shots and camaraderie and there's eastern europe in general a bunch of guys get together and you celebrate life intensely yeah people fight people just feel people experience life in a deep way you just get too drunk for for like for a reason but i don't see that as like drinking drinking that's like a a journey towards a destination it's like to me drinking is like whiskey neat or beer like you said ice cold beer yeah this is that afternoon beer like for a person like me who's extremely regimented and disciplined sometimes you get the situation i i just remember i mean just i remember there's a bar at mit where i just remember in the afternoon there was like a business meeting i sat down we started with a beer and they were like really crisply cold some kinda lager and then just one beer and two beers and all of a sudden you say fuck it let's just the rest of the day this is what this is and you said bright like you just light and just nature is beautiful out there oh and you just said fuck it to all the meetings fuck it to everything else just the camaraderie the the just talking about life being silly being you know all of that see that see you're describing something i'll never get because i'm not regimented i would love i would love i would love only for the moment that you get to have you get the most precious little angel's breath that anyone's gonna get because you live this life that's dialed in and it's scheduled and so when you say fuck it it's like that's like me doing coke like it's like oh fuck it yeah like and you can just do that with beer that is fucking amazing i would love to live a regimented life just to get the chance to go hey guys i'm not performing surgery today fuck it hey guys yeah this this bus full of kids kids gotta it's gotta drive itself home fuck it i couldn't even i couldn't even tell you you know what's so interesting about me and you is like you know you know i'm a fan of yours i couldn't even i don't really know what ai is like other than like dildos or ai right like like if it has some electronics in it yeah it's not electronics it's it's no i don't think a dildo classifies as a robot because i thought that's how they're gonna take over fucking mankind just well they start with these the the fucking womanizer that knows how to eat a pussy and then they're like we don't need men anymore but like it's so interesting that i couldn't even like i can barely tell you what my dad does for a living he's a lawyer i could kind of like he's called me and said hey man you gotta stop talking about what i do because you're not doing it right mhmm i i go what do you mean he's like that's not whatever you're saying i do i don't do and so but like i couldn't even begin to explain your job to my daughter well i think there's the way you do the job which is the way you experience life the regimented just even just a nine to five job right you have do you work nine to five no but i work much more than that yeah but there's no every kind of lifestyle has its complexities i think nine to five means you have to wake up at a certain time every day do people tell you to to pull it back and and they're like hey you're working too hard yeah a lot of people what i want in my life what i love in my life especially people close to me are the ones that say work harder because everybody how do you get them how do you get them i don't have anyone in my life that does that everybody's always worried about me everyone's worried about me everyone's always worried about me the only thing no one ever says if i showed you my dms right now my my text all it is is like hey man i'm worried about you yeah like joe i i love joe to death not once has he he always i don't know if you've seen the caring joe eyes where like i'm worried about you yeah where it's like and you're like hey man don't do that and he's like i'm worried about you and and you're like don't fucking worry about me i'm working it's i'm just working i love working i love what i do i love what i do i i can only imagine that you love what you do as much as i love what i do because that's all i ever wanna think about it's all i ever wanna talk about it's all i ever wanna be like i i i i when when my wife wants me to take august and whatever the august whatever the fuck is up in the month of september that's comes after august no but like july and august off yeah after we do fully loaded and i was like no i was like what do you mean like so like what i'll just what am i like sitting in a chair and stuff mhmm she said no you can do like take up a hobby i go writing jokes mhmm can i get on stage can i do sets in the city because i'm not gonna fucking you do you want me to like like i don't understand i don't understand people who don't i don't understand people who don't have the drive to work all the time i don't understand that i envy it i envy it because i go i would love mhmm to just be like i'm gonna play video games i can't play a video game if i did i'd be on twitch trying to make money like i love how do you find someone who goes you need to work harder yeah especially when they see like i i don't know what you look like but i i look tormented when i'm working very hard like it means like it's easy to worry for my well-being it's not like i'm happy go lucky but i'm happy underneath it my working too hard is like on a plane every other day or every day getting up at six working out and then going until like two in the morning or one in the morning and then going to sleep and then getting up at six working out getting on a plane going to another place like that's what my working it's just a lot of travel in mine mhmm if i didn't drink on planes i don't think anyone would probably worry about me at all they'd be like no you're doing great but the working out is there so i i gotta ask you because you and i seem to have a similar relationship with running i like this idea of slow treadmill i like running slow yeah like you know like a ten minute mile or something like this so i'll just run forever just listen to an audiobook listen to brown noise think i love it what's brown noise it's actually brownian noise but short brown noise it's kinda like white noise but deeper so it's just noise like that oh wow it kinda sounds like a waterfall and i'll just listen to it and something happens to i think there's yeah you can ask huberman about this i don't but apparently there's some science that kind of focuses the mind and so on it's funny because i think sometimes what people don't get about running is they go they get on and they put it on like a six right away on like a treadmill and they go i can't do this for fucking thirty minutes but you can if you build yourself up to your six and you play games i play games with myself a lot like i'll play games where i go i and i i can do this i can do this i i can do this almost not all day long but i can do this a lot longer like i did it for two hours the other day mhmm before my workout or no hour and a half before my workout where i started a three point five walking and then i and then i get my jog up to like a five and then i'm like five point five and then i go six and then i go and once i'm at a six my body's really loose mhmm and so then i'll go alright bring it down to a three point five and then i go punch it to a seven point five for a quarter of a mile and then let's walk at a four let's jog at a five right i can do that i love they're called fartlets i think and i love those like where that's like it's regimented running and sprinting at certain levels i love that and i love also when i work out to listen to music but put on foreign language cooking shows on netflix can you explain that they just put it on mute you don't need to hear it for some reason they're sexier the way they're shot they're sexier yeah and it's like street food asia and they're just watching them make street food in asia there's one called broth it's called broth the nation of broth and they're just making broths and you're like fuck i want some broth so this is south america this is asia south america asia they do one on pizzas i've watched this one on pizzas that i've watched it there's like four episodes i've watched every episode so many times that my trainer goes god that's that fucking i would i could watch that again yeah i love watching foreign language cooking shows on mute when i work out while blasting music while blasting hips she's there alright well i usually run outside but i do the same kind of thing i i don't mind hiking and i like i do like you know what my fun thing the fun thing i would do and this is this is ripped off totally from campaigns is i like to go there's a great hike called frieman canyon out in the valley where i live and i'd be like alright i'm gonna run to frieman canyon i'm gonna jog to frieman canyon i'm gonna hike frieman canyon and then i'm gonna jog back and then i wonder how long that is and i go don't think about it just know that that's your thing just know that that's your thing and then all of a sudden you're like shit that was eight miles you're like that's a fucking beast the hike doesn't even feel like anything the hike once you do the jog is the hard part there the jog home is a fucking cake walk i had the best jog when i was in serbia i had the best jog i think it was in hyde park i think the name of the park is hyde park it was get this it was eighty percent downhill wow so this jog you started the park and it was like and i'll i'll do it like this for you you went like downhill like this downhill like this downhill like this and then it was like a little steep incline to get to the beginning of it so you it was like a little like nice like lower back pain you're like okay okay and then the jog was perfect mhmm and you did it four times it was four miles i loved it my very first day i did it a butterfly got in front of me it's like six in the morning yeah six in the morning a butterfly got in front of me and it ran the whole first mile in front of me and i just it was like so surreal it would disappear and then it would show back up in front of me yeah you sure it was real definitely real and then the next day and so i go i'm on the right path i'm on the right path the next day i go for a jog six in the morning and it rained and as i'm doing this steep uphill incline a tree collapsed in front of me just went and i went woah a tree fell in the woods and i was here to see it shut the fuck up i was like that's crazy and it didn't hit me i go i'm on the right path and then i started getting overthinking it like the next day i saw a condom and i was like this is a complete joy i was like people fucked here last night but yeah but yeah that was one of the best jogs i've ever had i could do that i could run that park every single day and no one jogged that park in serbia i actually recently had a condom on my doorstep and i i wanted to ask whoever is up there above what what that means what the you know what the story behind that is yeah because i you know just a pissed off ups guy i i i just was it compromised what do you mean compromised like was there stuff inside it oh i didn't look i mean very few people put on the condom and go it's not for me i'm gonna take it off yeah it's a little tight i don't know it could be to to send a message like a horse's head kinda thing oh yeah i don't know i don't know what the message is exactly do you use condoms if you had a one night stand would you use a condom i don't know what a condom is i ain't never heard call i'm i'm learning good call i'm i'm learn i've learned about sex from you today if my wife dies there's no condoms in my future i'll get it i don't care have babies i don't give a shit you're a man of principle i like it marc maron wrote something about your book many many many ages ago life of the party i think it's there's an interesting question in there so first of all wrote eloquently about you bert kreischer is one of the great american wild men a gonzo warrior driven not by cynicism or desire to reveal dark truths but instead by a deep almost essential need to have a good time no matter what his stories track the trials and tribulations of a big hearted dude trying to fit in help out and party and find himself after all is said and done we arrive with him at the true humility of joy so when was this desire for pure joy born in you it seems like you are driven towards this joy yeah i think i think i arrived at it in college i wasn't always the guy i am i was really a serious pretty serious dude like when i got to college like dark brooding serious yeah i wanted to be like i wanted to be like eddie vedder i wanted to be like a a poet and a fucking lead singer and i wanted to be taken seriously and i wanted to be attractive and i wanted to be yeah you know like i wanted to be wanted by chicks and and respected by dudes and you know and slowly but surely i think the bird i really am chipped away at that and was like hey man like i i would say funny i would say funny things that would surprise me they were so funny mhmm meaning like in my fraternity i'd say things that were the funniest thing that i i go how did i think of that yes and then slowly i was like and i remember as i as i chipped away at that and as i got older i would i would i would lean towards that we would go on a bus trip to like clemson and i would get on the the the walkie talkie on the bus and i would do stand up for like an hour i just make jokes for an hour and i and i loved the impulse of like you know you get on the bus and everyone's like we're gonna drink and you get that one group of girls that was gonna drink and then to break them and they're like oh fuck it fine let's drink and then that to to watch that happen and i think then once i and then when i went to russia this is so cliche for me to say but interacting with those young banditi mhmm they were they were pretty serious dudes they didn't have like they were pretty stoic dudes mhmm and when you could make them laugh it was like a real it was a real joy the silliest things i remember you know we were told there was a club it's called it was like it was called cafe or europa or maybe cafe americana that's where everyone really hung out like all the the real dudes the real dudes in saint petersburg and they had told us that like they told us in our class that russian women didn't have tampons mhmm so they were like bring tampons to give to the babushka the the dabushka that ran the floor after all this time the fact that your russian sucks is awesome yeah it's because you keep mispronouncing words horribly i horribly i'm so fucking bad yeah i am so bad you know that's how you know that's how i got the name of the machine right yeah i was trying to say i'm a machine though yeah and i said i'm a car yeah and they just were like and so i came into the room one night with a top pocket full of tampons yeah and they were like what are those for i said girls how are we gonna pick up girls and the look on their face was so it was so pure joy i remember the first night i brought out lemons and this is it sounds it sounds make believe now to say it because it's been in the movie and yeah but i brought out lemons we were in lemon drops i had vodka and lemons and sugar and a pocket knife and a fanny pack and i put out lemons and and this guy igor goes oh the machine runs on lemons like it was just so foreign that you would need lemon for them yeah and so i i think and i made friends with those like i mean like friends whatever you can but like definitely me and that guy igor were legit friends legit friends like but from a place of joy like being joyful it was like it was like real seeing them light up and then i remember backpacking through europe after that and realizing i could bring a spark of fun to like a campfire and i had little tricks like i learned all the currencies around the world and so i i'd challenge people to a currency game i go let's go head to head you say you you name a country and a currency and i'll name a country and a currency and i would i would slow roll them i'd just do the all the dollars right the chinese dollar the american dollar the australian dollar i'd run through all the dollars and they'd be be like you only know the dollars and then i and then i get start getting really deep mhmm i could make an event out of a night in in europe i could make an event i remember we were in strasbourg and the bar was supposed to close but i had friends coming to the bar they had the train hadn't gotten in in yet and i said i said don't close the bar i'll stand on the bar and i'll entertain everyone in this room i'll dance i'll do whatever if you just keep the bar open and the guy goes if you can keep me laughing i'll keep the bar open and i danced and and made this guy laugh on a bar for legit i'm not even like i'll legit thirty minutes until my friends walked in and they're like what the fuck's going on i had this ability to to to without humility i didn't mind looking like a fool and like doing and there were really stupid jokes at the time just very like base american frat boy jokes but i had a sparkle when i came back i feel i feel like i i learned how to like to do that and do funny things that were like fun like i would we go to a football game and i'd i'd i brought a camera around with me a lot i like to take pictures and i remember one of the jokes i'd go is i go hey everybody i told my parents i have a lot of friends can you guys gather around and we'll take a picture mhmm and so you know like fifty people would lean around like hey and like just the dumbest silliest things and and and and i don't and i wasn't a big self promoter so these would happen and i would i was just doing them for me and my friends mhmm i'd bring a guitar out and i just make up songs and and and and so i think in in watching this this serious bird get chipped away at until my like six and a half year of college where it was just this silly guy and then rolling stones written about me and i'm like and then i'm like well and i remember a couple serious dads going yo you got a chance to turn this into something you need to go to you need to follow your dream and i tried to stand up the first night and i was like maybe not wasn't the funniest guy but man they laughed and we had a good time for thirty minutes and it worked and it was stream of consciousness and i was like yeah and then of course you know that same little path you take gets convoluted in in in new york because you wanna be a serious comic and you wanna be taken seriously and you wanna be edgy and you wanna say the and then slowly but surely that you're the real bert chips away at it and he's like yeah man just fucking take your shirt off and kill a beer yeah like fucking tell the machine story tell a story about your stupid kids like just you don't need to be the fucking edgiest dude in the room leave that to the good ones let let let bill and fucking joe and tom they're the those are the legit fucking gangster comics there i mean those are the fucking you're never gonna out fucking chappelle those those guys are fucking gangsters do what you do have fun make life fun and seize the day and fucking try to bring a spark to people and let them forget about their fucking day and the the interesting thing about alcohol i've i don't really like drinking in terms of the actual physical like how it makes me feel but there's the the the camaraderie that happens what i wish there was another way to get there but i don't think there is that joy you get of just everybody getting together taking shots or drinking not the polite kind of drinking but just everybody just the the fuck it kind of drinking yeah and when someone goes alright i'm in like that alright yeah that's the funnest and then yeah especially when you have a big group yeah and there's like a big group and yeah like we were at the premiere the other night and and and i was working i was legit working i had to i'm trying to sell the movie to outlets media outlets and bust them with the boy bust them with the boys my wife flew them in to surprise me and they're over on the red carpet and they're like yo let's let's scull a beer let's kill a beer and i was like oh and then i'm like oh fucking i don't give a this is what life's about and that moment where they're like yeah that's the funniest fucking especially when i can get leanne to do it when i get leanne to get a drink and she'll and she's like like i wasn't supposed to drink last night and she was like you wanna just we still get have a glass of wine in the front yard and you're like oh my heart skips a beat i go glass of wine in the front yard are we gonna talk wild are we gonna say crazy shit to each other like fuck yeah in the front yard front yard yeah what are you doing in the front yard let the dogs play oh big trees in the front yard why are you sitting on the where were you sitting sitting in the in the adirondacks on the front porch letting the dogs play letting the dogs rest in the front yard maybe go over pick some cherries look at the fucking trees hear the wind going through the front yard and then you go to the backyard that's where the cigar comes out a little more privacy but you have black red wine mall back keep our sulfites low yeah wine is a whole another one too i feel sophisticated oh yeah i've i went i traveled before ukraine i went to paris for the first time i drank wine there and i felt like i was a sophisticated man you know dude i mean speak much french but you don't need to you don't need to just start smoking too just have a fucking cigarette yeah i was gonna start writing poetry dude hemingway there's like a glass of wine in italy and like like just out in like we went we went the most beautiful fucking day of my life just outside florence they have all the vineyards and stuff and we took a vespa tour nice and and it was fucking and ayla's too young to ride so she's on the back and now everyone can drink there you know you're not supposed to drink and drive vespas but they don't they go a glass of wine is nothing yeah and you're like okay i guess i'll have a couple then if you think one's nothing then i think two's nothing also so this is drunk bert on a vespa drunk not even drunk but just lightly bus yeah lightly feathered yeah where and it's beautiful my wife hasn't been drinking georgia has georgia's too young isla is too young but i had at dinner we had a couple and we're going through these hills and it starts raining and it starts raining and i go ayla what are we missing and she goes music big boy and i go what do you wanna hear and then she just starts going i can't stop this feeling she's screaming it at behind and then i hear georgia screaming it and then leanne singing it and then sandy and her two daughters are singing it we're all in these vespas and we're all singing it and and i and i swear to god if i hadn't been lightly feathered i don't know if i would have been like adam what are we missing because you know alcohol will give you that thing like what's next yeah what's bigger how do we take this to the next level and then i got this little girl who's still my little girl at that moment when she's singing sing it all the good times aiming up so long yeah i'm in up girl and then we stop at the and we stop at the light and all of us are looking and it's pouring rain it is i mean i remember sobbing crying sobbing crying sobbing crying and then i was like let's get these fucking vespas up and get to a vineyard yeah and then we went to a vineyard and the all the girls tried a little wine no one got buzzed or anything but you're just sitting there with your family going like fuck dude it and i'm not certain you get that without a little bit of a little bit but then a lot is also interesting i had i had a lot of whiskey with rogan once i think i saw that yeah i think i saw that with whitney too he was in a push up concert contest with david the only time i met david goggins in person one of the great embarrassments in my life is trashed out of my mind i'm trying to say how much of a fan i am and i could tell by the look in his eye that what is actually coming out of my mouth is not good it's not good and his wife is embarrassed standing right there also just everybody's embarrassed for me and i'm trying my best and then somehow i find myself a minute later doing push ups with him as a challenge push ups i didn't it wasn't counting all i knew i'm not stopping and he was polite enough to stop i think probably like fifty i don't know there's a a gift someone gives you when they get drunk and they allow they get drunk and they lower their guard mhmm and they allow you to see them that way it's a gift it's a real gift it's just as cool as like pulling someone aside and going yo i'm into anime mhmm like are you cool with that and then they're going yeah i'm oh yeah can i show you some cool anime and then you're like that's not my thing but it's like a cool thing it's like sharing cool music with someone or or like tell them something about your childhood when you when you get drunk like real drunk around someone you're giving them a gift yeah and that gift is i want you to see me for everything i am yeah you're not gonna get any lies you're not gonna get any bullshit this is me at my absolute worst i have a rule i will never never get mad at someone for getting too fucked up because they're giving you a gift they're saying like yo i did this on accident but i trust you enough to let you know that this is who i am and this is what you're getting i love it i love it especially when it comes to someone you don't expect like you mhmm shut the fuck up david gockin shoulda hugged you and said thanks for showing me this yeah i guess that really i haven't you're right i haven't thought of it that way there's an intimacy to that because that is a gift of like fragility like this is me i mean i'm i'm a very loving drunk but i'm boy am i a dumb drunk i'm just dumb i bet you haven't seen dumb drunk well dumb in terms of the eloquence of the words that are coming out of my mouth so like you're just not stitching words together correctly to make sentences no i turn into hemingway lost in translation like i'll start saying random words but like translate it to japanese and back to english it's not making any sense but there's love like i think what you feel is this kind of desire to connect that i think i always feel towards other people but when i'm drunk let me just say fuck it i don't need to be polite i'll just be loving oh fully yeah yeah it's it's cool when people let you see that in them because some people are really like measured like no one drink and then i'm done i don't want it no no no no and you're like oh show me a little more mhmm and then like it's cool and i never like i and i love my favorite moment is in the next morning when they're like did i make an ass out of myself and you get to say not at all yeah not at all that's the coolest thing because some people bad people will leverage that over yeah you can and you can see it's a bully tactic they'll leverage that the bad interactions i've had mhmm with in this business that we were talking about earlier they were people that that when you got fucked up they used it against you yeah they held it over your head and they said listen man i don't know what the fuck but if you want and you're like hold on mhmm and then and then they made you they gaslight you into thinking you were the only one that was fucked up and you're like okay i guess i know who you are now and i was like didn't you get fucked up a little bit too yeah like i know we smoked weed and i thought we ate xanax but like what about the i know i had a a couple beers but like i wasn't that fucked up well whitney is really good at that because she's the the person i woke up next morning and she she said you know hey you you you're wonderful you're eloquent you're great i i'm sure she was making that up completely it was funny i got blackout drunk at whitney's roast of me like blackout drunk don't remember any of it and don't remember any of it don't remember speaking on the microphone i don't remember talking in the microphone and and i i i did the set apparently yeah and i said to whitney like in a real moment of vulnerability whitney is like a sister to me like a legit sister my daughters call her aunt whitney leanne she's like a sister leanne if she comes over to do a podcast whitney will show up an hour early and sit with leanne out in leanne's rose garden and just talk mhmm and whitney i i said the next day i called whitney and i was getting on a plane and i was knew i was hungover i said how bad was i last night she goes you were fucking fantastic and just didn't let me sit with it then i watched the video and i was like oh i was fucking out of control i was way out of control thank you for lying to me yeah so while being a wild out there comic she's also this like caring and loving human being so interesting she has she has the most nurturing sensibility she is you she sends my daughter's gifts out of nowhere just out of nowhere they send georgia gifts up at college mhmm it's just a gift like she is just she takes care of people that's her love language and she's also the person that taught me what what the hell love language even means apparently there's a book and there's like five of them oh you and whitney i would love to sit in a fucking room and watch you two talk yeah she has a robot yeah that looks like her and that's the future that robot i told her she should have that robot do porn let someone fuck that robot mhmm and then and she and she could deep fake the face if she wants but i go promote it's promote it special that way like a full on not like showtime softcore porn like full on porn porn full on like to do like just like hi welcome inside yeah you look tired do you need a drink yeah oops i'm stuck in the dryer you know what's the promotion you're most proud of that you've done without a doubt it's gotta be when i took dance lessons yeah that was epic because i tried to get joe and tom and ari to do it for sober october i was reading for you and they said no joe's like absolutely not at all joe was gonna say no but joe's a legit dancer like he can legit dance yeah he took like dance lessons for a movie and is apparently an amazing dancer mhmm and so you're right he could have said yes he could have said yes because i don't remember listening to that podcast where you really made the pitch yeah and i said we all take hip hop dance lessons it's your your cardio is through the roof yeah and and those you do an an hour dance lesson then we all do a hip hop dance and then we all put our hip hop dances against each other and we see who has the best hip hop dance yep it's different than the typical stuff we do it's fun and we can also work out we can do everything but like let's do hip hop dance and joe adamantly was like that's a horrible idea i will not do that and then and then tom and ari just you know just whatever they were like yeah i i signed with joe we'll do something else and then i was like but i knew i liked hip hop dance and so i was like i'm gonna take hip hop dance lessons anyway i'm gonna just do it over sober october and i'm just gonna i'm gonna fucking do it then maybe maybe i'll do a hip hop dance video mhmm and then show it to them and let them rate me and then we did it and i and it was twelve hundred dollars and i for hip hop dance lessons for like a month or whatever for like a couple weeks and then when we did it i thought you know what i bet we could put tour dates next to this mhmm because it's it was it turned out being like kinda good but kinda funny i go but we could put tour dates next to this and it was the beginning of me figuring out the whole like my promos were short and quick mhmm and they were always like something silly what's up guys it's your boy bert kreischer and then that one blew up and immediate i was announcing the tour and immediately every tour date sold out and then every we added shows that day we added shows and every one of those sold out and i was like woah and then tom was like the fuck was that and i was like i think i just sold out my whole fucking tour and and then tom and then when tom did his one like that and put his tour dates on it yeah went over the top he sold all his tours and and he was like woah he's like dude i sold out every fucking show we've added shows i'm doing like an arena here and this is before we were doing arenas i was like shut the fuck up and that changed my game where i was like alright so everything's gotta be and then and then i was like i don't mind spending a little money and then the next one i did was the marching band and i was just like and but it was you know it's real crazy i just said can you guys get me a marching band and they were like yes like it's like twenty four hundred bucks i go cool and and they're like what do you want them to do and i go i don't know we'll figure it out and they came over and they had outfits and they were like so what do what do you what do you want us to play i go what song do you guys know and then they didn't even know each other they were all hired people and they were like rubber band man and i was like oh sure yeah and then we just scripted it out i was like alright i'll pretend it's a regular thing with the weights i'll walk out and then i'll blow a whistle mhmm and then you come out with the and then and then we see we got like two videos out of that and that sold out dates and then i was like fuck and then and then and then and then and then the real baller one the fucking real one the real one was i tore all the muscles in my arm going into into shooting the movie and i ripped all the tricep muscles off and they were retracted so i had to go in for surgery and the anesthesiologist said to me the night before he's like what music do you want going in going under and i was like what and he goes you can pick your music going under i said wait hold on what is it like he go i go is it like casual and he was like yeah i said i'm doing a promo read going under he goes what do you mean i said i'll i'll explain it to you tomorrow but i'm gonna i'm not gonna count backwards i'm just gonna do a promo read until i pass out mhmm and my phone's gonna fall on the ground all i need you to do is hit stop record mhmm and so they rolled me into surgery i had red rocks i'd only sold like seventy five percent of red rocks which is the biggest ten thousand is the biggest venue i'd i'd ever played in and i rolled in with my thing with ccr playing in the background and i just was like i was i lay here on this mat or on this steel pile i was terrified as i go into surgery i want you to know one thing i'm playing red rock september tenth and i started doing my promo read and he was like yeah i go jimmy buffett's there the night before and the night after he's like for real i go yeah you wanna come he's like hell yeah he's like alright he's like you're going under and he hits it i go officer and i dropped the phone woke up out of surgery and the first thing i said is where's my phone and he goes you got it and leanne's like i've already watched it it's good and i went for real nice and so like that was a that was a that was a that was a big one that was a big one too yeah that was genius but that was sort of opportunity kinda jumping in an idea have you ever met mister beast jimmy no so he he's i got to hang out with him for a day and listen to him brainstorm with the team ideas yeah he kinda sounds like you but on steroids in terms of like first of all willing to spend any amount of money on an idea like anything anything is allowed anything is allowed i love that energy the only thing is no like rated r stuff so he's really trying to go like for the broader audience for kids and so on so that's the limitation so you can't do like most of the ideas that pop into my head when anything is allowed is kinda dark yeah but the point is to really aggressively brainstorm every single day at the whiteboard like what and he does that for youtube shorts too for one minute videos really it's just like really like what is the coolest thing we could possibly do i love that i love that energy and that energy most people don't do that and they should basically youtubers do that because they're obsessed about this particular youtube algorithm and so on and and jimmy is the best at that but like that can benefit you if you're a scientist if you're a comedian if you're whatever just go all out it's there's something really authentically fun about just coming up with a really stupid idea and just going let's see what happens who gives a fuck mhmm we've had those like i thought i could catch an arrow one time and and my and my wife's like absolutely fucking not and i go i really think i can i go let's just get really close shoot it and then i'll see if i can catch it and she's like no that's not what you're doing and then my cousin's like hey we could cheat it to make you look like you caught an arrow and i went what he was just okay let's do it like this and so we did it and it got sold a ton of tickets it looks like i really caught it everyone knows i didn't catch an arrow i mean for the movie we did a promo legendary was like you do all the promos and we did a promo and i thought i could slide out of my car like tom cruise did in a in a helicopter yeah and with roller skates and get behind the car and then skate behind the car and we just ran over my foot and it was real and it was scary but we just caught it all and in doing it my cousin's like give me the read mhmm and i'm like duh my movie comes out memorial day weekend i think we have to go to the hospital and then we went to the hospital and i'm in a speedo with a helmet on yeah one broken roller skate and then and then that did really well and so like i said the whole thing is just turn the camera on you never know when it's gonna fucking happen and don't be afraid to look stupid and all that kind of stuff just go all out fucking ego is the death of comedy like when you when you really give a like if it's hard to be the coolest guy in the room and still wanna be a comedian it's just let yourself be whoever you are and you'll see the great ones they're like that they don't they you know they'll they're they're just regular fucking dudes and you get some real slick ones like dave dave's probably might be the coolest guy in the fucking room he might might really might be yeah but i think that's just who the fuck he is who who are the outside your close friend group who are the greats to your top five out of outside outside of my friend group so like for me probably norm macdonald oh mitch hedberg george carlin thomas seguer number one oh yeah no i just had no way to say that it's an interesting pairing no mitch hedberg dave attell dave attell dave attell every everybody deeply respects david attell more than even his comedy i love the show where he was insomniac insomniac he's so good at just the the natural comedy of human interaction he's a brilliant comic he's just a brilliant fucking mind norm macdonald's a fucking genius an absolute genius i mean look you know chappelle and bill burr are are the two best in our generation in my opinion and i and that's you know and that's understanding that like i'm still friends with some of the best in our generation but like just the way their brains work is really on the next level mhmm like you know what those are guys stanhope is the same way just fucking genius you know i rogan segura those are my friend group that's my really close friend group but like those other guys i'm i'm friends with but they're not like that's like yeah louis ck oh louis ck fuck he's amazing it's hard to do because you start like forgetting the it's like people and then it's almost like people go oh so you didn't like that person you're like no i fucking love that person yeah yeah i mean there's for for me like robin williams which is a whole another thing oh yeah sarah silverman fucking i love janine i mean i'm i'm i'm a fucking big janine fan i love her brain marin's fucking hilarious mhmm you know patton's brilliant david cross i mean there's like it's you know it's it's really to ignore those guys and those guys were like the whole forefront of the alternative comedy front they're fucking amazing yeah and the people that have like marin or joe that have podcasts is interesting it's an interesting pairing because you get to know like everything about them but then they're also comedians and i've gotten i've gone to joe's club a lot i i i listen to joe and just that whole group of comics do comedy and go to the same set over and over and over and to see how it changes it's it's really cool it's the coolest thing when i first started to watch someone like cattell was really brilliant at it because you'd watch him tinker with a set yeah and he it'd be he'd have a a an idea like hitting someone over the head with a hammer from behind and then he'd work it nine different ways you know and you'd be like woah so you're the hitting hammer in the head is the thing that he's working on i hope eddie murphy comes back he's one of the greats chris rock chris rock is fucking bring the pain is like the reason i got into comedy yeah do you have a device for young folks you seem like a stellar example of a successful human being or more seriously a very kinda nonlinear life do you have advice for young people in high school and college how to have a a good life they can be proud of don't worry too much about what you do when you get older but when you do start worrying find the thing you love and it'll never feel like work the to fucking i can't imagine what it must feel like to be a lawyer and have to read papers or whatever they do all day and know that that's my day yeah i mean that i it must feel like what iowa school felt like for me mhmm if you find that thing you love to do you will work endlessly effortlessly and hard as fucking shit every day and you'll love every day of your life find what you love and let it kill you bukowski said that for then that's the fucking thing because that's what i'm doing i'm letting it fucking take i'm i'm fucking i'm i'm on that fucking bullet train to fucking nowhere on this fucking comedy journey i love it i love it so it's like the hunter ass thompson thing what is it however you put it basically you're not supposed to be end up in a well preserved box you slide in sideways smoke just beat up yeah just just a giant mess i love i love those guys that can really live that life that are like yeah man i'm breaking it i'm breaking it down like a guy like tony hawk or matt hoffman like yeah if i if i don't fucking break the fuck out of this thing before i i'm yeah then i'm not doing it right then again there's also churchill who tried to break the thing and he couldn't lived into his nineties a bad motherfucker just a bad motherfucker so i guess the only hope we can have for bert kreischer is that you're gonna be the winston churchill of comedy my life is lived perfectly if i'm ninety five years old and all my friends are dead yeah they're like they're like can you believe that wolf got rogen yeah can you believe segura six hundred pounds and they had to carry him out in a crane out of that house can you believe that it's just bert kreischer and joey diaz left just standing there in october super october just the two of you left this is just laughing october is just i'm ninety five at the mark twain awards and they're like bert kreischer's still fucking here who saw that coming i
