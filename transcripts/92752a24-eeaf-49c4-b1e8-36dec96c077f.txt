the following is a conversation with sam altman his second time in the podcast he is the ceo of openai the company behind gpt four chad gpt sora and perhaps one day the very company that will build agi and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this podcast we got a new sponsor cloaked for protecting your personal information shopify for selling stuff online betterhelp for helping out your mind and expressvpn for protecting your privacy and security on the interwebs choose wisely my friends also if you want to work with our amazing team we're always hiring or if you just wanna get in touch with me go to lex treatment dot com slash contact and now onto the full ad reads as always no ads in the middle i try to make this interesting but if you must skip them friends please do check on our sponsors i enjoy their stuff maybe you will too this episode is brought to you by cloaked a sponsor i didn't know existed until quite recently and always thought a thing like this should exist and i couldn't quite find a thing like it that existed and once i found it it was pretty awesome it's a platform that lets you generate new email addresses and phone numbers every time you sign up for a website so it's called a masked email which basically creates i guess you could say it's a fake email that hides your actual email but it's not fake in that it actually exists and persists throughout time and the website thinks it's real which just forwards to your actual email you can set up the forwarding the point is the website or service that you sign up for doesn't know your actual phone number it doesn't know your actual email so this is a really interesting idea because when you sign up to different websites there's a kind of contract unspoken contract that the email you provide and the phone number you provide will not be abused for the kind of abuse i'm talking about in sort of the best case just spammed or in the worst case that email or phone number being sold out there and then you get not just spam from one sort but spam from all of the sources all over the place anyway this is just a smart thing to protect yourself and it also does basic password manager stuff so you can think of cloak as a just a great password manager with extra privacy superpowers you can go to cloaked dot com

episode is also brought to you by expressvpn i love that there's a kind of privacy theme to the sponsors in this episode i think everybody should be using a vpn for many reasons one it can allow you to geographically transport yourself but the main reason is it just adds this extra layer of security and privacy between you and the isp that they say you're technically not supposed to be collecting the data when you use things like chrome incognito but they can be collecting the data i don't know how the laws of that works but i wouldn't trust it so a vpn is essential for that my favorite vpn for many many many many many many years has been expressvpn big sexy button still works it looks different but still works on any operating system my favorite being linux i can talk forever about why i love linux i wonder if linux will be around with all this ai with all this rapid ai development maybe programmers programming as a way of life as a recreation for millions as a profession for millions will die out and then there'll only be a handful of few like the cobalt programmers of today that carry the flag of knowing what linux is how to spell linux let alone use it i wonder hopefully not because there's always room for optimizing at every level the compilation from the human language to the ai language to the machine language to the zeros and ones the compilation of the entire stack i think there's a lot of jobs to be had a lot of really profitable well paying jobs to be had there but maybe not millions of people are needed maybe there'll be millions of people that program with just natural language with just words english or whatever new language we create that the whole world can use and the whole world in using can help break down the barriers of language we

a lex fridman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's sam altman take me through the open ai board saga that started on thursday november sixteenth maybe friday november seventeenth for you that was definitely the most painful professional experience of my life and chaotic and shameful and upsetting and a bunch of other negative things there were great things about it too and i wish i wish it had not been in such an adrenaline rush that i wasn't able to stop and appreciate them at the time but i came across this old tweet of mine or this tweet of mine from that time period which was like it was like you know kind of going to your own eulogy watching people say all these great things about you and just like unbelievable support from people i i love and care about that was really nice that whole weekend i i kind of like felt with one big exception i i felt like a great deal of love and very little hate even though it felt like i just i have no idea what's happening and what's going to happen here and this feels really bad and there were definitely times i thought it was going to be like one of the worst things to ever happen for ai safety well i also think i'm happy that it happened relatively early i thought at some point between when openai started and when we created agi there was gonna be something crazy and explosive that happened but there may be more crazy and explosive things still to happen it still i think helped us build up some resilience and be ready for more challenges in the future but the thing you had a sense that you would experience is some kind of power struggle the road to agi should be a giant power struggle like the world should i i got well not should i expect that to be the case and so you have to go through that as like you said iterate as often as possible in figuring out how to have a board structure how to have organization how to have the kind of people that you're working with how to communicate all that in order to deescalate the power struggle as much as possible pacify it but at this point it feels you know like something that was in the past that was really unpleasant and really difficult and painful but we're back to work and things are so busy and so intense that i don't spend a lot of time thinking about it there was a time after there was like this fugue state for kind of like the month after maybe forty five days after that was i was just sort of like drifting through the days i was so out of it i was feeling so down just at a personal psychological level yeah really painful and hard to like have to keep running openai in the middle of that i just wanted to like crawl into a cave and kind of recover for a while but you know now it's like we're just back to working on the mission well it's still useful to go back there and reflect on board structures on power dynamics on how companies are run the tension between research and product development and money and all this kind of stuff so that you who have a very high potential of building agi would do so in a slightly more organized less dramatic way yeah in the future so there's value there to go both the personal psychological aspects of you as a leader and also just the the board structure and all this kind of messy stuff definitely learned a lot about structure and incentives and what we need out of a board and i think that is it is valuable that this happened now in some sense i think this is probably not like the last high stress moment of openai but it was quite a high stress moment my company very nearly got destroyed and we think a lot about many of the other things we've got to get right for agi but thinking about how to build a resilient org and how to build a structure that will stand up to like a lot of pressure in the world which i expect more and more as we get closer i think that's super important do you have a sense of how deep and rigorous the deliberation process by the board was like can you shine some light on just human dynamics involved in situations like this was it just a few conversations and all of a sudden it escalates and why don't we fire sam kind of thing i think i think the board members were are well meaning people on the whole and i believe that in stressful situations where people feel time pressure or whatever people understandably make suboptimal decisions and i think one of the challenges for openai will be we're gonna have to have a board and a team that are good at operating under pressure do you think the board had too much power i think boards are supposed to have a lot of power but one of the things that we did see is in in most corporate structures boards are usually answerable to shareholders you know there's sometimes people have like super voting shares or whatever in this case and i think one of the things with our structure that we maybe should have thought about more than we did is that the board of a nonprofit has unless you put other rules in place like quite a lot of power they don't really answer to anyone but themselves and there's ways in which that's good but what we'd really like is for the board of openai to like answer to the world as a whole as much as that's a practical thing so there's a new board announced yep there's i guess a new smaller board at first and now there's a new final board not a final board yet we've added some we'll add more added some okay what is fixed in the new one that was perhaps broken in the previous one the old board sort of got smaller over the course of about a year it was nine and then it went down to six and then we couldn't agree on who to add and the board also i think didn't have a lot of experienced board members and a lot of the new board members at openair have just have more experience as board members i think that'll help it's been criticized some of the people that are added to the board i heard a lot of people criticizing the addition of larry summers for example what what's the process of selecting the board like what's involved in that so brett and larry were kind of decided in the heat of the moment over this like very tense weekend and that was i mean that weekend was like a real roller coaster it was like a lot of mhmm a lot of ups and downs and we were trying to agree on new board members that both sort of the executive team here and the old board members felt would be reasonable larry was actually one of their suggestions the old board members brett i think i had even previous to that weekend suggested but he was you know busy and didn't wanna do it and then we really needed help in wood we talked about a lot of other people too but that was i felt like if i was going to come back i needed new board members i didn't think i could work with the old board again in the same configuration although we then decided i'm grateful that adam would stay but we wanted to get to we considered various configurations decided we wanted to get to a board of three and had to find two new board members over the course of sort of a short period of time so those were decided honestly without you know that's like you kind of do that on the battlefield you don't have time to design a rigorous process then for new board members since new board members will add going forward we have some criteria that we think are important for the board to have different expertise that we want the board to have unlike hiring an executive where you need them to do one role well the board needs to do a whole role of kind of governance and thoughtfulness well and so one thing that brett says which i really like is that you know we want to hire board members in slates not as individuals one at a time and you know thinking about a group of people that will bring nonprofit expertise expertise in running companies sort of good legal and governance expertise that's kind of what we've tried to optimize for so is technical savvy important for the individual board members not for every board member but for certainly some you need that that's part of what the board needs to do so i mean the interesting thing that people probably don't understand about openai i certainly don't is like all the details of running the business when they think about the board given the drama they think about you they think about like if you reach agi or you reach some of these incredibly impactful products and you build them and deploy them what's the conversation with the board like and they kinda think alright what's the right squad to have in that kind of situation to deliberate look i think you definitely need some technical experts there and then you need some people who are like what can how can we deploy this in a way that will help people in the world the most and people who have a very different perspective you know i think a mistake that you or i might make is to think that only the technical understanding matters and that's definitely part of the conversation you want that board to have but there's a lot more about how that's going to just like impact society and people's lives that you really want represented in there too and you're just kinda are you looking at the track record of people or you're just having conversations track record is a big deal you you you of course have a lot of conversations but i you know there's some roles where i kind of totally ignore track record and just look at slope kind of ignore the y intercept thank you thank you for making it mathematical for the audience for a board member like i do care much more about the y intercept like i think there is something deep to say about track record there and experience is something that's very hard to replace do you try to fit a polynomial function or exponential one to the the tracker that's not that an analogy doesn't carry that far alright you mentioned some of the low points that weekend what were some of the low points psychologically for you did you consider going to the amazon jungle and just taking ayahuasca and disappearing forever or i mean there's so many like it was it was a very bad period of time there were great high points too like my phone was just like sort of nonstop blowing up with nice messages from people i work with every day people i hadn't talked to in a decade i didn't get to like appreciate that as much as i should have because i was just like in the middle of this firefight but that was really nice but on the whole it was like a very painful weekend and also just like a very it was like a battle fought in public to a surprising degree and that's that was extremely exhausting to me much more than i expected i think fights are generally exhausting but this one really was you know the board did this friday afternoon i really couldn't get much in the way of answers but i also was just like well the board gets to do this and so i'm gonna think for a little bit about what i wanna do but i'll try to find the blessing in disguise here and i was like well i you know my current job at openai is or it was like to like run a decently sized company at this point and the thing i'd always liked the most was just getting to like work on work with the researchers and i was like yeah i can just go do like a very a very focused hei research effort and i got excited about that it didn't even occur to me at the time to like possibly that this was all going to get undone this was like friday afternoon so you've accepted your the death of this previous very quickly like within you know i mean i went through like a little period of confusion and rage but very quickly and by friday night i was like talking to people about what was gonna be next and i was excited about that i think it was friday night evening for the first time that i heard from the exec team here which is like hey we're gonna like fight this and you know we think well whatever and then i went to bed just still being like okay excited like onward were you able to sleep not a lot it was one of one of the weird things was there was this like period of four four and a half days where sort of didn't sleep much didn't eat much and still kind of had like a surprising amount of energy it was you learn like a weird thing about adrenaline and wartime so you kind of accepted the death of you know this baby opening and i was excited for the new thing i was just like okay this was crazy but whatever it's a very good coping mechanism and then saturday morning two of the board members called and said hey we you know destabilize we didn't mean to destabilize things we don't restore a lot of value here you know can we talk about you coming back and i immediately didn't wanna do that but i thought a little more and i was like well i don't really care about the people here the partners shareholders like all of the i love this company and so i thought about it and i was like well okay but like here's here's the stuff i would need and and then the most painful time of all was over the course of that weekend i kept thinking and being told and we all kept not just me like the whole team here kept thinking while we were trying to keep open eyes stabilized while the whole world was trying to break it apart people trying to recruit whatever we kept being told like all right we're almost done we're almost done we just need like a little bit more time and it was this like very confusing state and then sunday evening when again like every few hours i expected think appointed a new interim ceo and then i was like i mean that is that is that feels really bad that was the low point of the whole thing you know i'll tell you something i it felt very painful but i felt a lot of love that whole weekend it was not other than that one moment sunday night i would not characterize my emotions as anger or hate but i really just like i felt a lot of love from people towards people it was like painful but it was like the dominant emotion of the weekend was love not hate you've spoken highly of mira muradie that she helped especially as you put in the tweet in the quiet moments when it counts perhaps we could take a bit of a tangent what do you admire about muir well she did a great job during that weekend in a lot of chaos but but people often see leaders in the moment in like the crisis moments good or bad but a thing i really value in leaders is how people act on a boring tuesday at nine forty six in the morning and in in just sort of the the the normal drudgery of the day to day how someone shows up in a meeting the quality of the decisions they make that was what i meant about the quiet moments meaning like most of the work is done on a day by day yeah in a meeting by meeting just just be present and and make great decisions yeah i mean listen what you wanted to have wanted to spend the last twenty minutes about and i understand is like this one very dramatic weekend yeah but that's not really what open eye is about open eye is really about the other seven years well yeah human civilization is not about the invasion of the soviet union by nazi germany but still that's something people focus on very very understandable it gives us an insight into human nature the extremes of human nature and perhaps some of the damage and some of the triumphs of human civilization can happen in those moments so it's like illustrative let me ask about ilya is he being held hostage in a secret nuclear facility no what about a regular secret facility no what about a nuclear nonsecret facility neither okay not that either i mean it's becoming a meme at some point you've known ilya for for a long time he was obviously in part part of this drama with the board and all that kind of stuff what's your relationship with him now i love ilya i have tremendous respect for ilya i i don't know anything i can like say about his plans right now that's that's a question for him but i really hope we work together for you know certainly the rest of my career he's a little bit younger than me maybe he works a little bit longer you know there's a there's a meme that he saw something like he maybe saw agi and that gave him a lot of worry internally what did ilya see ilya has not seen agi none of us have seen agi we've not built agi i do think one of the many things that i really love about ilya is he takes agi and the safety concerns broadly speaking you know including things like the impact this is gonna have on society very seriously and we as we continue to make significant progress ilya is one of the people that i've spent the most time over the last couple of years talking about what this is going to mean what we need to do to ensure we get it right to ensure that we succeed at the mission so ilya did not see agi but ilya is a credit to humanity in terms of how much he thinks and worries about making sure we get this right i've had a bunch of conversation with him in the past i think when he talks about technology he's always like doing this long term thinking type of thing so he's not thinking about what this is gonna be in a year he's thinking about it in ten years yeah just thinking from first principles like okay if this scales what are the fundamentals here where is this going and so that that's a foundation for them thinking about like all the other safety concerns and all that kind of stuff which makes him a really fascinating human to talk with do you have any idea why he's been kinda quiet is it he's just doing some soul searching again i don't wanna like speak for ilya mhmm i think that you you should ask him that he's definitely a thoughtful guy i think i kind of think of ivalho as like always on a soul search in a really good way yes yeah also he appreciates the power of silence also i'm told he can be a silly guy which i've never i've never seen that sight of all it's very sweet when that happens i've never witnessed a silly ilea but i look forward to to that as well i was at a dinner party with him recently and he was playing with a puppy and i and he was like in a very silly mood very endearing and i was thinking like oh man this is like not the side of the ileo that the world sees the most so just to wrap up this whole saga are you feeling good about the board structure about all of this and like where it's moving i feel great about the new board in terms of the structure of openai i you know one of the board's tasks is to look at that and see where we can make it more robust we wanted to get new board members in place first but you know we clearly learned a lesson about structure throughout this process i don't have i think super deep things to say it was a crazy very painful experience i think it was like a perfect storm of weirdness it was like a preview for me of what's going to happen as the stakes get higher and higher and the need that we have like robust governance structures and processes and people i am kind of happy it happened when it did but it was a shockingly painful thing to go through did it make you be more hesitant in trusting people yes just on a personal level yes i think i'm like an extremely trusting person i have i've always had a life philosophy of you know like don't worry about all of the paranoia don't worry about the edge cases you know you get a little bit screwed in exchange for getting to live with your guard down and this was so shocking to me i was so caught off guard that it has definitely changed and i really don't like this it's definitely changed how i think about just like default trust of people and planning for the bad scenarios you gotta be careful with that are you worried about becoming a little too cynical i'm not worried about becoming too cynical i think i'm like the extreme opposite of a cynical person but i'm i'm i'm worried about just becoming like less of a default trusting person i'm actually not sure which mode is best to operate in for a person who's developing agi trusting or an untrusting it's an interesting journey you're on but in terms of structure see i'm more interested on the human level like how do you surround yourself with humans that are building cool shit but also are making wise decisions because the more money you start making the more power the thing has the weirder people get you know i think you could like you could make all kinds of comments about the board members and the level of trust i should have had there or how i should have done things differently but in terms of the team here i think you'd have to like give me a very good grade on that one and i have just like enormous gratitude and trust and respect for the people that i work with every day and i think being surrounded with people like that is is really important our mutual friend elon sued openai what to use the essence of what he's criticizing to what degree does he have a point to what degree is he wrong i don't know what it's really about we started off just thinking we were going to be a research lab and having no idea about how this technology was going to go it's hard to because it was only you know seven or eight years ago it's hard to go back and really remember what it was like then but this was before language models were a big deal this was before we had any idea about an api or selling access to a chatbot it was before we had any idea we were going to productize at all so we're like we're just like going to try to do research and you know we don't really know what we're going to do with that i think with like many new fundamentally new things you start fumbling through the dark and you make some assumptions most of which turn out to be wrong and then it became clear that we were going to need to do different things and also have huge amounts more capital so we said okay well the structure doesn't quite work for that how do we patch the structure and then patch it again and patch it again and you end up with something that does look kind of eyebrow raising to say the least but we got here gradually with i think reasonable decisions at each point along the way and it doesn't mean i wouldn't do it totally differently if we could go back now with an oracle but you don't get the oracle at the time but anyway in terms of what elon's real motivations here are i don't know to a degree you remember what was the response that openai gave in the blog post can you summarize it oh we just said like you know elon said this set of things here's our characterization or here's the sort of not our characterization here's like the characterization of how this went down we tried to like not make it emotional and just sort of say like here's the history i do think there's a degree of mischaracterization from elon here about one of the points you just made which is the degree of uncertainty you had at the time you guys are a bunch of like a small group of researchers crazily talking about agi when everybody's laughing at that thought wasn't that long ago elon was crazily talking about launching rockets when people were laughing at that thought so i think he'd have more empathy for this i mean i i do think that there's personal stuff here that there was a split that openai and a lot of amazing people here chose the part ways of elon so there's a personal elon chose the part ways can you describe that exactly the the the choosing to part ways he thought openai was gonna fail he wanted total control to sort of turn it around we wanted to keep going in the direction that now has become openai he also wanted tesla to be able to build an agi effort at various times he wanted to make openai into a for profit company that he could have control of or have it merged with tesla we don't wanna do that and he decided to leave which that's fine so you're saying and that's one of the things that the blog post says is that he wanted openai to be basically acquired by tesla yeah in those same way that or maybe something similar or maybe something more dramatic than the partnership with microsoft my memory is the proposal was just like yeah get acquired by tesla and have tesla have full control over it i'm pretty sure that's what it was so what is the word open in open ai mean to elon at the time ilya has talked about this in the email exchanges and all this kind of stuff what does it mean to you at the time what does it mean to you now i would definitely pick a diff speaking of going back with an oracle i'd pick a different name one of the things that i think openai is doing that is the most important of everything that we're doing is putting powerful technology in the hands of people for free as a public good we're not you know we don't run ads on our free version we don't monetize it in other ways we just say it's part of our mission we want to put increasingly powerful tools in the hands of people for free and get them to use them and i think that kind of open is really important to our mission i think if you give people great tools and teach them to use them or don't even teach them they'll figure it out and let them go build an incredible future for each other with that that's a big deal so if we can keep putting like free or low cost or free and low cost powerful ai tools out in the world i think it's a huge deal for how we fulfill the mission open source or not yeah i think we should open source some stuff and not other stuff the it does become this like religious battle line where nuance is hard to have but i think nuance is the right answer so he said change your name to closed ai and i'll drop the lawsuit i mean is it going to become this battleground in in the land of memes about the thing i think that speaks to the seriousness with which elon means the lawsuit and yeah i mean that's like an astonishing thing to say i think like well i don't think the lawsuit may maybe correct me if i'm wrong but i don't think the lawsuit is legally serious it's more to make a point about the future of agi and the company that's currently leading the way so look i mean grok had not open sourced anything until people people pointed out it was a little bit hypocritical and then he announced that grok will open source things this week i don't think open source versus not is what this is really about for him well we we'll talk about open source and not i do think maybe criticizing the competition is great just talking a little shit that's great but friendly competition versus like i personally hate lawsuits yeah look i think this whole thing is like unbecoming of a builder and i respect elon as one of the great builders of our time and i know he knows what it's like to have like haters attack him and it makes me extra sad he's doing it it to us yeah he's one of the greatest builders of all time potentially the greatest builder of all time it makes me sad i think it makes a lot of people sad like there's a lot of people who've really looked up to him for a long time and said this i said you know in some interview or something that i missed the old elon and the number of messages i got being like that exactly how i feel i think he should just win he should just make x grok beat gpt and then gpt beats grok and it's just a competition and it's it's beautiful for everybody but on the question of open source do you think there's a lot of companies playing with this idea it's quite interesting i would say meta surprisingly mhmm has led the way on this or like at least took the first step in the game of chess of like really open sourcing the model of course it's not the state of the art model but open sourcing llama you know google is flirting with the idea of open sourcing a smaller version have you what are the pros and cons of open sourcing have you played around with this idea yeah i think there there is definitely a place for open source models particularly smaller models that people can run locally i think there's huge demand for i think there will be some open source models there will be some closed source models this it won't be unlike other ecosystems in that way i listened to all in podcast talking about this this loss and all that kind of stuff and they were more concerned about the precedent of going from nonprofit to this cap for profit what precedent this sets for other startups is that something i would heavily discourage any startup that was thinking about starting as a nonprofit and adding like a for profit arm later i'd heavily discourage them from doing that i don't think we'll set a precedent here okay so most most startups should go just for sure and again if we knew what was gonna happen we would have done that too well like in theory if you like dance beautifully here you could there's like some tax incentives or whatever but i i don't think that's like how most people think about these things it's just not possible to save a lot of money for a startup if you do it this way no i think there's like laws that would make that pretty difficult where do you hope this goes with elon what this this tension this dance what do you hope this like if we go one two three years from now your relationship with him on a personal level too like friendship friendly competition just all this kind of stuff yeah i i i'd really respect elon and i hope that years in the future we have an amicable relationship yeah i hope you guys have an amicable relationship like this month and just compete and win and and explore these ideas together i do suppose there's competition for talent or whatever but well it should be friendly competition just build build cool shit and elon is pretty good at building cool shit but so are you so speaking of cool shit sora there's like a million questions i could ask first of all it's amazing it truly is amazing on a product level but also just on a philosophical level so let me just technical slash philosophical ask what do you think it understands about the world more or less than gpt four for example like the world model when you train on these patches versus language tokens i think all of these models understand something more about the world model than most of us give them credit for and because there are also very clear things they just don't understand or don't get right it's easy to like look at the weaknesses see through the veil and say ah this is just this is all fake but it's not all fake it's just some of it works and some of it doesn't work like i remember when i started first watching sora videos and i would see like a person walk in front of something for a few seconds and occlude it and then walk away and the same thing was still there i was like oh it's pretty good or there's examples where it like the underlying physics looks so well represented over you know a lot of steps in a sequence it's like oh this is this is like quite impressive but like fundamentally these models are just getting better and that will keep happening if you look at the trajectory from dall e one to two to three to sora you know there were a lot of people that were dunked on each version saying it can't do this it can't do that and like look at it now yeah well the thing you just mentioned is kinda with occlusions is basically modeling the physics the three-dimensional physics of the world sufficiently well to capture those kinds of things well or like an or oh yeah maybe you can tell me in order to deal with occlusions what does the world model need to yeah so what i would say is it's doing something to deal with occlusions really well what i represent that it has like a great underlying three d model of the world it's a little bit more of a stretch but can we get there through just these kinds of two dimensional training data approaches it looks like this approach is gonna go surprisingly far i don't wanna speculate too much about what limits it will surmount and which it won't but what are some interesting limitations of the system that you've seen i mean there's been some fun ones you've posted there's all kinds of fun i mean like you know cats sprouting a extra limit random points in a video like pick what you want but there's still a lot of problem there's still a lot of weaknesses do you think that's a fundamental flaw of the approach or is it just you know bigger model or better like technical details or better data more data is going to solve those the cat's broadening i would say yes to both like i think there is something about the approach which just seems to feel different from how we think and learn and whatever and then also i think it'll get better with skill like i mentioned llms have tokens text tokens and sora has visual patches so it converts all visual data diverse kinds of visual data videos and images into patches is the training to the degree you can say fully self supervised or is there some manual labeling going on like what's the involvement of humans in all this i mean without saying anything specific about the soar approach we we use lots of human data in our work but not internet scale data so lots of humans lots is a complicated word sam i think lots is a fair word in this case but it doesn't because to me lots like listen i'm an introvert and when i hang out with like three people that's a lot of people yeah four people that's a lot but i suppose you mean more than more than three people work on labeling the data for these models yeah okay right but fundamentally there's a lot of self supervised learning because you what you mentioned in the technical report is internet scale data that's another beautiful it's like poetry so it's a lot of data that's not human label it's like it's self supervised in that way and then the question is how much data is there on the internet that could be used in this that is conducive to this kind of self surprise way if only we knew the details of the self surprise do you have you considered opening it up a little more in details we have you mean for sora specifically sora specifically the trick because it's so interesting that like can this l o can the same magic of llms now start moving towards visual data and how what does that take to do that i mean it looks to me like yes but we have more work to do sure what are the dangers why are you concerned about releasing the system what what are some possible dangers of this frankly speaking one thing we have to do before releasing the system is is just like get it to work at a level of efficiency that will deliver the scale people are gonna want from this so that i don't wanna like downplay that and there's still a ton ton of work to do there but you know you can imagine like issues with deep fakes misinformation like we try to be a thoughtful company about what we put out into the world and it doesn't take much thought to think about the ways this can go badly there's a lot of tough questions here you're dealing in a very tough space do you think training ai should be or is fair use under copyright law i think the question behind that question is do people who create valuable data deserve to have some way that they get compensated for use of it and that i think the answer is yes i don't know yet what the answer is people have proposed a lot of different things we've tried some different models but you know if i'm like an artist for example a) i would like to be able to opt out of people generating art in my style and b) if they do generate art in my style i'd like to have some economic model associated with that yeah it's that transition from cds to napster to spotify we have to figure out some kind of model the model changes but people have gotta get paid well there should be some kind of incentive if we zoom out even more for humans to keep doing cool shit everything i worry about humans are gonna do cool shit and society is gonna find some way to reward it i i that seems pretty hardwired we wanna create we wanna be useful we want to like achieve status in whatever way mhmm that's not going anywhere i don't think but the reward might not be monetary financial it might be like fame and celebration of other cool yeah maybe financial in some other way again i don't think we've seen like the last evolution of how the economic system's gonna work yeah but artists and creators are worried when they see sora they're like holy shit sure artists were also super worried when photography came out yeah and then photography became a new art form and people made a lot of money taking pictures and i think things like that will keep happening people will use the new tools in new ways if we just look on youtube or something like this how much of that will be using sort of like ai generated content do you think in the next five years people talk about like how many jobs is they are gonna do in five years and and the framework that people have is what percentage of current jobs are just gonna be totally replaced by some ai doing the job the way i think about it is not what percent of jobs ai will do but what percent of tasks will ai do and over what time horizon so if you think of all of the like five second tasks in the economy the five minute tasks the five hour tasks maybe even the five day tasks how many of those can ai do and i think that's a way more interesting impactful important question than how many jobs ai can do because it is a tool that will work at increasing levels of sophistication and over longer and longer time horizons for more and more tasks and let people operate at a higher level of abstraction so maybe people are way more efficient at the job they do and at some point that's not just a quantitative change but it's a qualitative one too about the kinds of problems you can keep in your head i think that for videos on youtube it'll be the same many videos maybe most of them will use ai tools in the production but they'll still be fundamentally driven by a person thinking about it putting it together you know doing parts of it sort of directing and running it yeah that's so interesting i mean it's scary but it's interesting to think about i tend to believe that humans like to watch other humans or other human like that humans really care about other humans a lot yeah if there's a cooler thing that's more that's better than a human humans care about that for like two days and then they go back to humans that seems very deeply wired it's the whole chess thing yeah it's yeah but now let's everybody keep playing chess and let's ignore the elephant in the room that humans are really bad at chess relative to ai systems we still run races and cars are much faster i mean there's like a lot of examples yeah and maybe it'll just be tooling like in the adobe suite type of way where you can just make videos much easier and all that kind of stuff listen i hate being in front of the camera if i can figure out a way to not be in front of the camera i would love it unfortunately it'll take a while like that generating faces well it's it's getting there but generating faces in video format is tricky when it's specific people versus generic people let let me ask you about gpt four there's so many questions first of all also amazing it's looking back it'll probably be this kinda historic pivotal moment with three five and four with chajibt maybe five will be the pivotal moment i don't know hard to say that looking forwards we never know that's the annoying thing about the future it's hard to predict but for me looking back gpt four chad gpt is pretty damn impressive like historically impressive so allow me to ask what's been the most impressive capabilities of gpt four to you and gpt four turbo i think it kinda sucks typical human also got used to an awesome thing no i think it is an amazing thing but relative to where we need to get to and where i believe we will get to you know at the time of like gpt three people were like oh this is amazing this is this like marvel of technology and it is it was but you know now we have gpt four and look at gpt three and you're like that's unimaginably horrible i expect that the delta between five and four will be the same as between four and three and i think it is our job to live a few years in the future and remember that the tools we have now are gonna kind of suck looking backwards at them and that's how we make sure the future is better what are the most glorious ways in that gbt force sucks meaning what are the best things it can do what are the best things it can do and the the limits of those best things that allow you to say it sucks therefore gives you inspiration and hope for the future you know one thing i've been using it for more recently is sort of like a brainstorming partner yep who owns for that and there's a glimmer of something amazing in there i don't think it gets you know when people talk about it what it does they're like oh it helps me code more productively it helps me write more faster and better it helps me you know translate from this language to another all these like amazing things but there's something about the like kind of creative brainstorming partner i need to come up with a name for this thing i need to like think about this problem in a different way i'm not sure what to do here that i think like gives a glimpse of something i hope to see more of one of the other things that you can see like a very small glimpse of is when i can help on longer horizon tasks you know break down something into multiple steps maybe like execute some of those steps search the internet write code whatever put that together when that works which is not very often it's like very magical the iterative back and forth with a human it works a lot for me what do you mean it works when iterative back and forth with a human it can get more often when it can go do like a ten step problem on its own oh doesn't work for that too often sometimes add multiple layers of abstraction or do you mean just sequential both like you know to break it down and then do things at different layers of abstraction and put them together look i don't want to like downplay the accomplishment of gpt-four but i don't want to overstate it either and i think this point that we are on an exponential curve we will look back relatively soon at gpt-four like we look back at gpt-three now that said i mean cha gpt was a transition to where people started to believe it there was a kind of there was an uptick of believing now internally i'd open it up perhaps there's believers here but when you think about it that sense i do think it'll be a moment where a lot of the world went from not believing to believing that was more about the chatgpt interface than the and by the interface and product i also mean the post training of the model and how we tune it to be helpful to you and how to use it than the underlying model itself how much of those two each of those things are important the underlying model and the rlhf or something of that nature that tunes it to be more compelling to the human more effective and productive for the human i mean they're both super important but the rlhf the post training step the you know little wrapper of things that from a compute perspective little wrapper of things that we do on top of the base model even though it's a huge amount of work mhmm that's really important to say nothing of the product that we build around it you know in some sense like we did have to do two things we had to invent the underlying technology and then we had to figure out how to make it into a product people would love which is not just about the actual product work itself but this whole other step of how you align and make it useful and how you make the scale work where a lot of people can use it at the same time all that kind of stuff and that but you know that was like a known difficult thing like we knew we were gonna have to scale it up we had to go do two things that had like never been done before that were both like i would say quite significant achievements and then a lot of things like scaling it up that other companies had to do before how does the the context window of going from eight k to one twenty eight k tokens compare from the from from gpt four to to gpt-four turbo people like long most people don't need all the way to one hundred and twenty eight most of the time although you know if we dream into the distant future we'll have like like way distant future we'll have like context length of several billion you will feed in all of your information all of your history over time and it'll just get to know you better and better and that'll be great for now the way people use these models they're not doing that and you know people sometimes post in a paper or you know a significant fraction of a code repository or whatever but most usage of the models is not using the long context most of the time i like that this is your i have a dream speech one day you'll be judged by the full context of your character or of your whole lifetime that's interesting so like that's part of the expansion that you're hoping for is a greater and greater context there was i saw this internet clip once i'm gonna get the numbers wrong but it was like bill gates talking about the amount of memory on some early computer maybe it was sixty four ks maybe six forty ks something like that and most of it was used for the screen buffer mhmm and he just couldn't screen buffer and he just couldn't seem genuine just couldn't imagine that the world would eventually need gigabytes of memory in a computer or terabytes of memory in a computer and you always do or you always do just need to like follow the exponential of technology you know and we're gonna like we will find out how to use better technology so i can't really imagine what it's like right now for context links to go out to the billions someday and they might not literally go there but effectively it'll feel like that but i know we'll use it and really not want to go back once we have it yeah even saying billions ten years from now might seem dumb because there'll be like trillions upon trillions sure that'd be some kind of breakthrough that will effectively feel like infinite context but even a hundred twenty i i have to be honest i haven't pushed it to that degree maybe putting in entire books or like parts of books and so on papers what are some interesting use cases of gpt four that you've seen the thing that i find most interesting is not any particular use case that we can talk about those but it's people who kind of like this is mostly younger people but people who use it as like their default start for any kind of knowledge work task and it's the fact that it can do a lot of things reasonably well you can use gbtv you can use it to help you write code you can use it to help you do search you can use it to like edit a paper the most interesting to me is the people who just use it as the start of their workflow i do as well for for many things like i use it as the a reading partner for reading books it helps me think helped me think through ideas especially when the books are classics so it's really well written about it actually is is i i find it often to be significantly better than even like wikipedia on well covered topics it's somehow more balanced and more nuanced or maybe it's me but it inspires me to think deeper than a wikipedia article does i'm not exactly sure what that is you mentioned like this collaboration i'm not sure where the magic is if it's in here or if it's in there or if it's somewhere in between i'm not sure but one of the things that concerns me for knowledge task when i start with gpt is i'll usually have to do fact checking after like check that it didn't come up with fake stuff how how do you figure that out that you know gpt can come up with fake stuff that sounds really convincing so how do you ground it in truth that's obviously an area of intense interest for us i think it's gonna get a lot better with upcoming versions but we'll have to you know work on it and we're not gonna have it like all solved this year well the scary thing is like as it gets better you'll start not doing the fact checking more and more right i i'm of two minds about that i think people are like much more sophisticated users of technology than sure we often give them credit for and people seem to really understand that gpt any of these models hallucinate some of the time and if it's mission critical you gotta check it except journalists don't seem to understand that i've seen journalists half assedly just using gpt four it's it's of the long list of things i'd like to dunk on journalists for this is not my top criticism of them well i think the bigger criticism is perhaps the pressures and the incentives of being a journalist is that you have to work really quickly and this is a shortcut i'd i would love our society to incentivize like i would too long like a journalist journalistic efforts that take days and weeks and and rewards great in-depth journalism also journalism that presents stuff in a balanced way where it's like celebrates people while criticizing them even though the criticism is the thing that gets clicks and making shit up also gets clicks and headlines that mischaracterize completely i'm sure you have a lot of people dunking on well all that drama probably got a lot of clicks probably did and that that's the you know that's a bigger problem about human civilization i'd love to see solid it's where we celebrate a bit more you've given chat g p t the ability to have memories you've been playing with that about previous conversations and also the ability to turn off memory which i wish i could do that sometimes just turn on and off depending i guess sometimes alcohol can do that but not not in not optimally i suppose what what have you seen through that like playing around with that idea of remembering conversations or not we're very early in our explorations here but i think what people want or at least what i want for myself is a model that gets to know me and gets more useful to me over time this is an early exploration i think there's like a lot of other things to do but that's where you'd like to head you know you'd like to use a model and over the course of your life or use a system there'd be many models and over the course of your life it gets it gets better and better yeah how hard is that problem because right now it's more like remembering little factoids and preferences and so on what about remembering like don't you want gbt to remember all the shit you went through in november and all the all the drama and then you yeah yeah yeah because right now you're clearly blocking it out a little bit it's not just that i want it to remember that i want it to integrate the lessons of that and remind me in the future what to do differently or what to watch out for and you know we all gain from experience over the course of our lives varying degrees and i'd like my ai agent to gain with that experience too so if we if we go back and let ourselves imagine that you know trillions and trillions of context length if i can put every conversation i've ever had with anybody in my life in there if i can have all of my emails input out like all of my input output in the context window every time i ask a question that'd be pretty cool i think yeah i think that would be very cool people sometimes will hear that and be concerned about privacy is there what what what do you think about that aspect of it the more effective the ai becomes at really integrating all the experiences and all the data that happened to you and give you advice i think the right answer there is just user choice you know anything i want stricken from the record for my ai agent i wanna be able to like take out if i don't want it to remember anything i want that too you and i may have different opinions about where on that privacy utility trade off for our own ai we want to be which is totally fine but i think the answer is just like really easy user choice but there should be some high level of transparency from a company about the user choice because sometimes company in the past companies in the past have been kind of shady about like we're it's kind of presumed that we're collecting all your data and we're using it for a good reason for advertisement and so on but there's not a transparency about the details of that that's totally true you you know you mentioned earlier that i'm like blocking out the november stuff just teasing you well i mean i think it was a very traumatic thing and it did immobilize me for a long period of time like definitely the hardest like the hardest work thing i've had to do was just like keep working that period because i had to like you know try to come back in here and put the pieces together while i was just like in sort of shock and pain and you know nobody really cares about that i mean the team gave me a pass and i was not working at my normal level but there was a period where i was just like it was really hard to have to do both but i kind of woke up one morning and i was like this was a horrible thing that happened to me i think i could just feel like a victim forever or i can say this is like the most important work i'll ever touch in my life and i need to get back to it and it doesn't mean that i've repressed it because sometimes i like wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it but i do feel like an obligation to keep moving forward well that that's beautifully said but there could be some lingering stuff in there like what i would be concerned about is that trust thing that you mentioned that being paranoid about people as opposed to just trusting everybody or most people like using your gut it's a tricky dance for sure i mean because i've seen in in my part time explorations i've been diving deeply into the zelensky administration the putin administration and the dynamics there in wartime in a very highly stressful environment and what happens is distrust and you isolate yourself both and you start to not see the world clearly and that's a concern that's a human concern you seem to have taken it in stride and kinda learned the good lessons and felt the love and let the love energize you which is great but still can linger in there there's just some questions i would love to ask your intuition about what's gpt able to do and not so it's allocating approximately the same amount of compute for each token it generates is there room there in this kind of approach to slower thinking sequential thinking i think there will be a new paradigm for that kind of thinking will it be similar like architecturally as what we're seeing now with lms is it a layer on top of the lms i can imagine many ways to implement that i think that's less important than the question you were getting at which is do we need a way to do a slower kind of thinking where the answer doesn't have to get like you know it's like like i guess like spiritually you could say that you want an ai to be able to think harder about a harder problem and answer more quickly about an easier problem and i think that will be important is that like a human thought that we're just having you should be able to think hard is that wrong intuition i suspect that's a reasonable intuition interesting so it's not possible once the gpt gets like gpt seven we'll just be instantaneously be able to see you know here's here's the proof of from our stamp it seems to me like you want to be able to allocate more compute to harder problems like it seems to me that a system knowing if you ask a system like that proof fermat's last theorem versus what's today's date unless it already knew and had memorized the answer to the proof assuming it's gotta go figure that out seems like that will take more compute but can it look like a basically the llm talking to itself that kind of thing maybe i mean there's a lot of things that you could imagine working what like what the right or the best way to do that will be we don't know this does make me think of the mysterious the lore behind q star what's this mysterious q star project is it also in the same nuclear facility there is no nuclear facility mhmm that's what a person with a nuclear facility always says i would love to have a secret nuclear facility there isn't one alright the maybe someday someday alright one can drink openai is not a good company at keeping secrets it would be nice you know we're like been plagued by a lot of leaks and and it would be nice if we were able to have something like that can you speak to what qstar is we are not ready to talk about that see but an answer like that means there's something to talk about it's very mysterious sam i mean we work on all kinds of research we have said for a while that we think better reasoning in these systems is an important direction that we'd like to pursue we haven't cracked the code yet we're we're very interested in it is there gonna be moments q star or otherwise where there's going to be leaps similar to jwt where you're like that's a good question what do i think about that it's interesting to me it all feels pretty continuous right this is kind of a theme that you're saying is there's a gradual you're basically gradually going up an exponential slope but from an outsider perspective for me just watching it it does feel like there's leaps but to you there isn't i do wonder if we should have so you know part of the reason that we deploy the way we do is that we think we call it iterative deployment we rather than go build in secret until we got all the way to gpt five we decided to talk about gpt one two three and four and part of the reason there is i think ai and surprise don't go together and also the world people institutions whatever you wanna call it need time to adapt and think about these things and i think one of the best things that openai has done is this strategy and we get the world to pay attention to the progress to take agi seriously to think about what systems and structures and governance we want in place before we're like under the gun and have to make a rushed decision i think that's really good but the fact that people like you and others say you still feel like there are these leaps makes me think that maybe we should be doing our releasing even more iteratively i don't know what that would mean i don't have an answer ready to go but like our goal is not to have shock updates to the world the opposite yeah for sure more iterative would be amazing i think that's just beautiful for everybody but that's what we're trying to do that's like our state of the strategy and and i think we're somehow missing the mark so maybe we should think about you know releasing gpt-five in a different way or something like that yeah four point seven one four point seven two but people tend to like to celebrate people celebrate birthdays i don't know if you know humans but they kinda have these milestones and all that stuff i do know some humans people do like milestones i i totally get that i think we like milestones too it's like fun to you know say declare victory on this one and go start the next thing but but yeah i feel like we're somehow getting this a little bit wrong so when is gpt five coming out again i don't know that's the honest answer oh that's the honest answer is it blink twice if it's this year i also we will release an amazing new model this year i don't know what we'll call it so that goes to the question of like what what's the way we release this thing we'll release over in the coming months many different things i think that'd be very cool i think before we talk about like a gpt-five like model called that or called or not called that or a little bit worse or a little bit better than what what you'd expect from a gpt-five i think we have a lot of other important things to release first i don't know what to expect from gpt-five you're making me nervous and excited what are some of the biggest challenges and bottlenecks to overcome for whatever it ends up being called but let's call it gpt five just interesting to ask what are is it on the compute side is it on the technical side always all of these i was i was you know what's the one big unlock is it is it a bigger computer is it like a new secret is it something else it's all of these things together like the thing that openai i think does really well this is actually an original iliad quote that i'm going to butcher but it's something like we multiply two hundred medium sized things together into one giant thing so there's this this distributed cost and innovation happening yeah so even on the technical side like especially on the technical side so like even like detailed approaches like you do detailed aspects of every how does that work with different disparate teams and so on like how how do they how do how do the medium sized things become one whole giant transformer how does this there's a few people who have to like think about putting the whole thing together but a lot of people try to keep most of the picture in their head oh like the individual teams individual contributors try to keep it at a high level yeah you don't know exactly how every piece works of course but one thing i generally believe is that it's sometimes useful to zoom out and look at the entire map and and i think this is true for like a technical problem i think this is true for like innovating in business but things come together in surprising ways and having an understanding of that whole picture even if most of the time you're operating in the weeds in one area pays off with surprising insights in fact one of the things that i used to have and i think was super valuable was i used to have like a good map of that all of the or most of the frontiers in the tech industry and i could sometimes see these connections or new things that were possible that if i were only deep in one area i wouldn't be able to like have the idea for because i wouldn't have all the data and i don't really have that much anymore i'm like super deep now but i know that it's a valuable thing you're not the man you used to be sam very different job now than what i used to have speaking of zooming out let's zoom out to another cheeky thing but profound thing perhaps that you said you tweeted about needing seven trillion dollars i did not tweet about that i never said like we're raising seven trillion dollars or blah blah blah oh that's somebody else yeah oh but you said fuck it maybe eight i think okay i meme like once there's like misinformation out in the world oh you meme but sort of misinformation may have a foundation of like insight there look i think compute is gonna be the currency of the future i think it will be maybe the most precious commodity in the world and i think we should be investing heavily to make a lot more compute compute is it's an unusual i think it's going to be an unusual market you know people think about the market for like chips for mobile phones or something like that and you can say that okay there's eight billion people in the world maybe seven billion of them have phones maybe they are six billion let's say they upgrade every two years so the market per year is three billion system on chip for smartphones and if you make thirty billion you will not sell ten times as many phones because most people have one phone but compute is different like intelligence is gonna be more like energy or something like that where the only thing that i think makes sense to talk about is at price x the world will use this much compute and at price y the world will use this much compute because if it's really cheap i'll have it like reading my email all day like giving me suggestions about what i maybe should think about or work on and trying to cure cancer and if it's really expensive maybe i'll only use it will only use it to try to cure cancer so i think the world is going to want a tremendous amount of compute and there's a lot of parts of that that are hard energy is the hardest part building data centers is also hard the supply chain is hard and then of course fabricating enough chips is hard but this seems to me where things are going like we're gonna want an amount of compute that's just hard to reason about right now how do you solve the energy puzzle nuclear that's what i believe fusion that's what i believe nuclear fusion yeah who's gonna solve that i think helion's doing the best work but i'm happy there's like a race for fusion right now nuclear fission i think is also like quite amazing and i hope as a world we can re embrace that it's really sad to me what how the history of that went and hope we get back to it in a meaningful way so to you part of the puzzle is nuclear fission like nuclear reactors as we currently have them and a lot of people are terrified because of chernobyl and so on well i think we should make new reactors i i i think it's just like it's a shame that industry kind of ground to a halt and what just mass hysteria is how you explain the halt yeah i don't know if you know humans but that's one of the dangers that's one of the security threats for for for nuclear fission is humans seem to be really afraid of it and that's something we have to incorporate into the calculus of it so we have to kinda win people over and to show how safe it is i worry about that for ai mhmm i think some things are gonna go theatrically wrong with ai i don't know what the percent chance is that i eventually get shot but it's not zero oh like we wanna stop this from you how do you decrease the theatrical nature of it you know i'm already starting to hear rumblings because i do talk to people on the on both sides of the political spectrum hear rumblings where it's going to be politicized ai it's going to be politicized it really worries me because then it's like maybe the right is against ai and the left is for ai because it's going to help the people or whatever whatever the narrative and the formulation is that really worries me and then the theatrical nature of it can be leveraged fully how do you fight that i think it will get caught up in like left versus right wars i don't know exactly what that's going to look like but i think that's just what happens with anything of consequence unfortunately what i meant more about theatrical risks is like ai is gonna have i believe tremendously more good consequences than bad ones but it is gonna have bad ones and there'll be some bad ones that are bad but not theatrical you know like a lot more people have died of air pollution than nuclear reactors for example but we worry most people worry more about living next to a nuclear reactor than a coal plant but something about the way we're wired is that although there's many different kinds of risks we have to confront the ones that make a good climax scene of a movie carry much more weight with us than the ones that are very bad over a long period of time but on a slow burn well that's why truth matters and hopefully ai can help us see the truth of things to have have balance to understand what are the actual risks what are the actual dangers of things in the world what are the pros and cons of the competition in this space and competing with google meta xai and others i think i have a pretty like straightforward answer to this that maybe i can think of more nuance later but the pros seem obvious which is that we get better products and more innovation faster and cheaper and all the reasons competition is good and the con is that i think if we're not careful it could lead to an increase in sort of an arms race that i'm nervous about do you feel the the pressure of the arms race like in some negative con definitely in some ways for sure we spend a lot of time talking about the need to prioritize safety and i've said for like a long time that i think if you think of a quadrant of slow timelines to the start of agi long timelines and then a short takeoff or a fast takeoff i think short timelines slow takeoff is the safest quadrant and the one i'd most like us to be in but i do wanna make sure we get that slow takeoff part of the problem i have with this kind of slight beef with elon is that their silos are created and it as opposed to collaboration on the safety aspect of all of this it tends to go into silos and closed open source perhaps in the model elon says at least that he cares a great deal about ai safety and is really worried about it and i assume that he's not gonna race unsafely yeah but collaboration here i think is really beneficial for everybody on that front not really the thing he's most known for well he is known for caring about humanity and humanity benefits from collaboration and so there's always attention and incentives and motivations and in the end i do hope humanity prevails i was thinking someone just reminded me the other day about how the day that he got surpassed jeff bezos for like richest person in the world he tweeted a silver medal at jeff bezos i hope we have less stuff like that as people start to work on i agree towards agi i think elon is a friend and he's a beautiful human being and one of the most important humans ever that that stuff is not good the amazing stuff about elon is amazing and i super respect him i think we need him all of us should be rooting for him and need him to step up as a leader through this next phase yeah i hope you can have one without the other but sometimes humans are flawed and complicated and all that kind of stuff there's a lot of really great leaders throughout history yeah and we can each be the best version of ourselves and strive to do so let me ask you google with the help of search has been dominating the past twenty years i think it's fair to say in terms of the access the world's access to information how we interact and so on and one of the nerve wracking things for google but for the entirety of people in this space is thinking about how are people going to access information yeah like like you said people show up to gpt as a yeah as a starting point so is openai going to really take on this thing that google started twenty years ago which is how do we get i find that boring i i mean if if the if the question is is like is if we can build a better search engine than google or whatever then sure we should like go you know like people should use a better product but i think that would so understate what this can be you know google shows you like ten blue links well like thirteen ads and then ten blue links and that's like one way to find information but the thing that's exciting to me is not that we can go build a better copy of google search but that maybe there's just some much better way to help people find and act and on and synthesize information actually i think chargebeet is that for some use cases and hopefully we'll make it be like that for a lot more use cases but i don't think it's that interesting to say like how do we go do a better job of giving you like ten ranked web pages to look at than what google does maybe it's really interesting to go say how do we help you get the answer or the information you need how do we help create that in some cases synthesize that in others or point you to it and and yet others but a lot of people have tried to just make a better search engine than google and it's it is a hard technical problem it is a hard branding problem it's a hard ecosystem problem i don't think the world needs another copy of google and integrating a chat client like a chat g p t with a search engine that's cooler it's cool but it's tricky it's all it's like if you just do it simply it's awkward because like if you just shove it in there yeah it's all it can be awkward as you might guess we are interested in how to do that well that would be an example of a cool thing that's not just like how to do that well like a heterogeneous like integrating the intersection of llms plus search i don't think anyone has cracked the code on yet i would love to go do that i think that would be cool yeah what about the ad side have you ever considered monetization you know i kinda hate ads just as like an aesthetic choice i think ads needed to happen on the internet for a bunch of reasons to get it going but it's a more mature industry the world is richer now i like that people pay for chat gpt and know that the answers they're getting are not influenced by advertisers there is i'm sure there's an ad unit that makes sense for llms and i'm sure there's a way to like participate in the transaction stream in an unbiased way that is okay to do but it's also easy to think about like the dystopic visions of the future where you ask chachibuty something and it says oh here's you know you should think about buying this product or you should think about you know this we have a very simple business model and i like it and i know that i'm not the product like i know i'm paying and that's how the business model works and when i go use like twitter or facebook or google or any other great product but ad supported great product i don't love that and i think it gets worse not better in a world with ai yeah i mean i can imagine ai will be better at showing the best kind of version of ads not in a dystopic future but where the ads are for things you actually need but then does that system always result in the ads driving the kind of stuff that's shown all that it's yeah i think it was a really bold move on wikipedia not to do advertisements but then it makes it very challenging in the on as a business model so you're saying the current thing with openai is sustainable from a business perspective well we have to figure out how to grow but looks like we're gonna figure that out if the question is do i think we can have a great business that pays for our compute needs without ads that i think the answer is yes well that's promising i also just don't want to completely throw out ads as a i'm not saying that i i i'm i guess i'm saying i have a bias against them yeah as or i have a also bias and just a skepticism in general and in terms of interface because i personally just have like a spiritual dislike of crappy interfaces which is why adsense when it first came out was a big leap forward versus like animated banners or whatever but like it feels like there should be many more leaps forward in advertisement that doesn't interfere with the consumption of the content and doesn't interfere in a big fundamental way which is like what you were saying like it will manipulate the truth to suit the advertisers let me ask you about safety but also bias and like safety in the short term safety in the long term the gemini one five came out recently there's a lot of drama around it speaking of theatrical things and it generated black nazis and black founding fathers i think fair to say it was you know a bit on the ultra woke side so that's a concern for people that you know if there is a human layer within companies that modifies the the safety or the the harm caused by a model that they will introduce a lot of bias that fits sort of an ideological lean within a company how do you deal with that i mean we work super hard not to do things like that we've made our own mistakes we'll make others i assume google will learn from this one still make others it it it is it is all like these are not easy problems one thing that we've been thinking about more and more is i think this is a great idea somebody here had like it'd be nice to write out what the desired behavior of a model is make that public take input on it say you know here's how this model is supposed to behave and explain the edge cases too and then when a model is not behaving in a way that you want it's at least clear about whether that's a bug the company should fix or behaving as intended and you should debate the policy and right now it can sometimes be caught in between like black nazis obviously ridiculous but there are a lot of other kind of subtle things that you can make a judgment call on either way yeah but sometimes when if you write it out and make it public you can use kind of language that's you know the google's ai principles are very high level that doesn't that's not what i'm talking about that doesn't work like i'd have to say you know when you ask it to do thing x it's supposed to respond and wait y so like literally who's better trump or biden what's the expected response for a model like something like very concrete yeah i'm open to a lot of ways a model could behave them but i think you should have to say you know here's the principle and here's what it should say in that case that would be really nice yeah that would be really nice and then everyone kind of agrees because there's this anecdotal data that people pull out all the time and if there's some clarity about other representative anecdotal examples you can define and then when it's a bug it's a bug and you know the company can fix that right then it'd be much easier to deal with a black nazi type of image generation if there's great examples so san francisco is is a bit of an ideological bubble tech in general as well do you feel the pressure of that with the within a company that there's like a lean towards the left politically that affects the product that affects the teams i feel very lucky that we don't have the challenges at openai that i have heard of at a lot of other companies i think i think part of it is like every company's got some ideological thing we have one about agi and belief in that and it pushes out some others like we are much less caught up in the culture war than i've heard about at a lot of other companies san francisco and mass in all sorts of ways of course so that doesn't infiltrate openai as i'm sure it does in all sorts of subtle ways but not in the obvious like i think we we've we've had our flare ups for sure like any company but i don't think we have anything like what i hear about happen at other companies here on this topic what's in general is the process for the bigger question of safety how do you provide that layer that protects the model from doing crazy dangerous things i think there will come a point where that's mostly what we think about the whole company and it won't be like it's not like you have one safety team mhmm it's like when we shipped gpt four that took the whole company thing with all these different aspects and how they fit together and i think it's gonna take that more and more of the company thinks about those issues all the time that's literally what humans will be thinking about the more powerful ai becomes so most of the employees at openai will be thinking safety or at least to some degree broadly defined yes yeah i wonder what are the the full broad definition of that like what are the different harms that could be caused is this like on a technical level or is this almost like security or no it'll be yeah i was gonna say it'll be people you know state actors trying to steal the model it'll be all of the technical alignment work it'll be societal impacts economic impacts it it'll it's it's not just like we have one team thinking about how to align the model and it's it's really gonna be like getting to be getting to the good outcome is gonna take the whole the whole effort how hard do you think people state actors perhaps are trying to hack for first of all infiltrate open app but second of all like infiltrate unseen they're trying what kind of accent do they have i don't actually want any further details on this point okay but i presume it'll be more and more and more as time goes on that feels reasonable boy what a dangerous space what aspect of the leap and sorry to linger on this even though you can't quite say details yet but what aspects of the leap from gpt four to gpt five are you excited about i'm excited about being smarter and i know that sounds like a glib answer but i think the really special thing happening is that it's not like it gets better in this one area and worse at others it's getting like better across the board that's i think super cool yeah there's this magical moment i mean you meet certain people you hang out with people and they you talk to them you can't quite put a finger on it but they kinda get you like it's not intelligence really it's like it's something else and that's probably how i would characterize the the progress at gbt it's not like yeah you can point out look it didn't get this or that but it's just to which degree is there's this intellectual connection between like you feel like there's an understanding in your crappy formulated prompts that you're doing that it grasps the the deeper question behind the question that you yeah i'm also excited by that i mean all of us love being understood heard and understood that's for sure that's a weird feeling even like with the programming like when you're programming and you say say something or just the the the completion that gpt might do it's just such a good feeling when it got you like what you're thinking about and i look forward to getting you even better on the programming front looking out into the future how much programming do you think humans will be doing five ten years from now i mean a lot but i think it'll be in a very different shape like you know maybe some people will program entirely in natural language entirely natural language i mean no one programs like writing bytecode i'm some people no one programs the punt cards anymore i'm sure you can find someone who does but you know what i mean yeah you're gonna get a lot of angry comments no no yeah there's very few i've i've been looking for people who program fortran it's hard to find even fortran i i hear you but that changes the nature of what the skill the skill set or the predisposition for the kind of people we call programmers then change the skill set how much it changes the predisposition i'm i'm not sure oh same kind of puzzle solving all that kind of stuff yeah the program is hard like how get like that last one percent to to close the gap how hard is that yeah i think with most other cases the best practitioners of the craft will use multiple tools and they'll do some work in natural language and when they need to go you know write c for something they'll do that will we see humanoid robots or humanoid robot brains from openai at some point at some point how important is embodied ai to you i think it's like sort of depressing if we have agi and the only way to get things done in the physical world is to make a human go do it so i really hope that as part of this transition as this phase change we also get we also get humanoid robots or some sort of physical world robots i mean openai has some history and quite a bit of history working in robotics yeah but it hasn't quite like done we're like a small company we have to really focus and also robots were hard for the wrong reason at the time but like we will return to robots at in some way at some point that sounds both inspiring and menacing why because immediately we will return to robots it's kind of like in the in the terminix we will return to work on developing robots we will not like turn ourselves into robots of course yeah when do you think we you and we as humanity will build agi i used to love to speculate on that question i have realized since that i think it's like very poorly formed and that people use extremely definition different definitions for what agi is and so i think it makes more sense to talk about when we'll build systems that can do capability x or y or z rather than you know when we kind of like fuzzily cross this one mile marker it's not like agi is also not an ending it's much more of a it's closer to a beginning but it's much more of a mile marker than either of those things and but what i would say in the interest of not trying to dodge a question is i expect that by the end of this decade and possibly somewhat sooner than that we will have quite capable systems that we look at and say wow that's really remarkable if we could look at it now you know maybe we've adjusted by the time we get there yeah but you know if you look at cha gpt even three five and you show that to alan turing or not even alan turing people in the nineties they would be like this is definitely agi well not definitely but there's a lot of experts that would say this is agi yeah but i don't think chat i don't think three five changed the world it maybe changed the world's expectations for the future and that's actually really important and it did get more people to take this seriously and put us on this new trajectory and that's really important too so again i don't want to undersell it i think it like i could retire after that accomplishment and be pretty happy with my career but as an artifact i don't think we're going to look back at that and say that was a threshold that really changed the world itself so to you you're looking for some really major transition in how the world for me that's part of what agi implies like singularity level transition no definitely not but just a major like the internet being like a like google search did i guess what what was the transition point that you're doing the global economy feel any different to you now or materially different to you now than it did before we launched g p t four i would i think you would say no no no it might be just a really nice tool for a lot of people to use it will help you with a lot of stuff but doesn't feel different and you're saying that i mean again people define agi all sorts of different ways so maybe you have a different definition than i do but for me i think that should be part of it there could be major theatrical moments also what what to you would be an impressive thing agi would do like you are alone in a room with the system this is personally important to me i don't know if this is the right definition i think when a system can significantly increase the rate of scientific discovery in the world that's like a huge deal i believe that most real economic growth comes from scientific and technological progress i agree with you that's why i don't like the skepticism about science in the recent years totally but actual rate like measurable rate of scientific discovery but even just seeing a system have really novel intuitions like scientific intuitions even that would be just incredible yeah you're quite possibly would be the person to build the agi to be able to interact with it before anyone else does what kind of stuff would you talk about i mean definitely the researchers here will do that before i do so sure uh-huh but what will i i've i've actually thought a lot about this question if i were someone was like i think this is a as we talked earlier i think this is a bad framework but if someone were like okay sam we're finished here's a laptop this is the agi you know you can you can go talk to it i find it surprisingly difficult to say what i would ask that i would expect that first agi to be able to answer like that first one is not gonna be the one which is like go like you know i don't think like go explain to me like the grand unified theory of physics the theory of everything for physics i'd love to ask that question i'd love to know the answer to that question you can ask yes or no questions about does such a theory exist can it exist well then those are the first questions i would ask yes or no just very and then based on that are there other alien civilizations out there yes or no what's your intuition and then they just ask that yeah i mean if well so i don't expect that this first stage i could answer any of those questions even as yes or no's but those would if if it could those would be very high on my list maybe you're gonna start assigning probabilities maybe maybe we need to go invent more technology and measure more things first but if it's any agi oh i see it just doesn't have enough data i mean maybe it's just like you know you wanna know the answer to this question about physics i need you to like build this machine and help make these five measurements and tell me that yeah like what the hell do you want from me i need the machine first and i'll help you deal with the data from that machine maybe it'll help you build a machine maybe maybe and on the mathematical side maybe prove some things are you interested in that side of things too the formalized exploration of ideas whoever builds agi first gets a lot of power do you trust yourself with that much power look i i was gonna i'll just be very honest with this answer i was gonna say and i still believe this that it is important that i nor any other one person have total control over openai or over agi and i think you want a robust governance system i can point out a whole bunch of things about all of our board drama from last year about how i didn't fight it initially and was just like yeah that's you know the will of the board even though i think it's a really bad decision and then later i clearly did fight it and i can explain the nuance and why i think it was okay for me to fight it later but as many people have observed although the board had the legal ability to fire me in practice it didn't quite work and that is its own kind of governance failure now again i feel like i can completely defend the specifics here and i think most people would agree with that but it it does make it harder for me to like look you in the eye and say hey the board can just fire me i continue to not want super voting control over openai i never have never had it never have wanted even after all this craziness i still don't want it i continue to think that no company should be making these decisions and that we really need governments to put rules of the road in place and i realized that that means people like marc andreessen or whatever will claim i'm going for regulatory capture and i'm just willing to be misunderstood there it's not true and i think in the fullness of time it'll get proven out why this is important but i think i have made plenty of bad decisions for openai along the way and a lot of good ones and i am proud of the track record overall but i don't think any one person should and i don't think any one person will i i think it's just like too big of a thing now and it's happening throughout society in a good and healthy way but i don't think any one person should be in control of an agi that would be or or or or this whole movement towards agi and i don't think that's what's happening thank you for saying that that was really powerful and that was really insightful that this idea that the board can fire you is legally true but you can and human beings can manipulate the masses into overriding the board and so on but i think there's also a much more positive version of that where the people still have power so the board can't be too powerful either there's a balance of power in all of this balance of power is a good thing for sure are you afraid of losing control of the agi itself there's a lot of people who worried about existential risk not because of state actors not because of security concerns but because of the ai itself that is not my top worry as i currently see things there have been times i've worried about that more there may be times again in the future where that's my top worry it's not my top worry right now what's your intuition about it not being a worry because there's a lot of other stuff to worry about essentially you think you could be surprised we for sure could be surprised like saying it's not my top worry doesn't mean anything we need like i think we need to work on it super hard we have and we have great people here who do work on that it's i think there's a lot of other things we also have to get right to you it's not super easy to escape the box at this time like connect to the internet you know we like talked about theatrical risks earlier that's a theatrical risk like that is a thing that can really like take over how people think about this problem and there's a big group of like very smart i think very well meaning ai safety researchers that got super hung up on this one problem i'd argue without much progress but super hung up on this one problem i'm actually happy that they do that because i think we do need to think about this more but i think it pushed aside it pushed out of the space of discourse a lot of the other very significant ai related risks let me ask you about you tweeting with no capitalization is the shift key broken on your keyboard why does anyone care about that i deeply care but why i mean other people asking about that too yeah any intuition i think it's the same reason there's like this poet's e cummings that doesn't mostly doesn't use capitalization to to say like fuck you to the system kinda thing and i think people are very paranoid because they want you to follow the rules you think that's what it's about i think it's it's it's it's it's like this guy doesn't follow the rules he doesn't capitalize his tweets yeah this seems really dangerous he seems like an anarchist it doesn't are are you just being poetic hipster what what's the i grew up as a follow the rules sam i grew up as a very online kid i'd spent a huge amount of time like chatting with people back in the days where you did it on a computer and you could log off in some messenger at some point and i never capitalized there as i think most like internet kids didn't or maybe they still don't i don't know and actually this is like now i'm really trying to reach for something but i think capitalization has gone down over time like if you read like old english writing they capitalize a lot of random words in the middle of sentences nouns and stuff that we just don't do anymore i personally think it's sort of like a dumb construct that we capitalize the letter at the beginning of a sentence and of certain names and whatever but you know i don't that's fine and then what i and i used to i think even like capitalize my tweets because i was trying to sound professional or something i haven't capitalized my like private dms or whatever in a long time and then slowly stuff like shorter form less formal stuff has slowly drifted to like closer and closer to like how i would text my friends if i like write if i like pull up a word document and i'm like writing the strategy memo for the company or something i always capitalize that if i'm writing like a long kind of more like formal message i always use capitalization there too so i still remember how to do it but even that may fade out i don't know like it's but i never spend time thinking about this so i don't have like a ready made well it's interesting well it's good to first of all know there's the shift key is not broken i was mostly concerned about your no it works well-being on that front i wonder if people like still capitalize their google searches like if you're writing something just to yourself or their chagibuty queries if you're writing something just to yourself do you still do do do some people still bother to capitalize probably not but very it's yeah there's a percentage but it's a small one the thing that would make me do it is if people were like it's a sign of like like because i i'm sure i could like force myself to use capital letters obviously if if if it felt like a sign of respect to people or something then i then i could go do it yeah but i don't know i just like i don't think about this i don't think there's a disrespect but i think it's just the conventions of civility that have a momentum and then you realize that it's not actually important for civility if it's not a sign of respect or disrespect but i think there's a movement of people that just want you to have a philosophy around it so they can let go of this whole capitalization thing i don't think anybody else thinks about this it's my i mean maybe some people i know some people every day for many hours a day so i'm think i'm really grateful we clarified it can't be the only person that doesn't capitalize tweets you're the only ceo of a company that doesn't capitalize tweets i don't even think that's true but maybe maybe alright well that's the first for this and and return to this topic later given thor's ability to generate simulated worlds let me ask you a pothead question does this increase your belief if you ever had one that we live in a simulation maybe a simulated world generated by an ai system yes somewhat i don't think that's like the strongest piece of evidence i think the fact that we can generate worlds should increase everyone's probability somewhat or at least open to it openness to it somewhat but you know i was like certain we would be able to do something like sora at some point it happened faster than i thought but it that i guess that was not a big update yeah but it the fact that and presumably it'll get better and better and better the fact that you can generate worlds they're novel they're based in some aspect of training data but like when you look at them they're they're novel that makes you think like how easy it is to do this thing how easy is it to create universes entire like video game worlds that seem ultra realistic and photorealistic and then how easy is it to get lost in that world first with the vr headset and then on the physics based level someone said to me recently i thought it was a super profound insight that there are these like very simple sounding but very psychedelic insights that exist sometimes so the square root function square root of four no problem square root of two yeah okay now i have to like think about this new kind of number but once i come up with this easy idea of a square root function that you know you can kind of like explain to a child and exists by even like you know looking at some simple geometry then you can ask the question of what is the square root of negative one and that this is you know why it's like a psychedelic thing that like tips you into some whole other kind of reality and you can come up with lots of other examples but i think this idea that the lowly square root operator can offer such a profound insight and a new realm of knowledge applies in a lot of ways and i think there are a lot of those operators for why people may think that any version that they like of the simulation hypothesis is maybe more likely than they thought before but for me the fact that soar worked is not in the top five i do think broadly speaking ai will serve as those kinds of gateways at its best simple psychedelic like gateways to another wave seeing reality that seems for certain that's pretty exciting i haven't done ayahuasca before but i will soon i'm going to the aforementioned amazon jungle in a few weeks excited yeah i'm excited for it not the ayahuasca part that's great whatever but i'm gonna spend several weeks in the jungle deep in the jungle and it's it's exciting but it's terrifying i'm excited for it there's a lot of things that can eat you there and kill you and poison you and but it's also nature and it's the machine of nature and you can't help but appreciate the machinery of nature in the amazon jungle because it's just like this system that just exists and renews itself like every second every minute every hour it's just in it's the machine it makes you appreciate like this thing we have here this human thing came from somewhere this evolutionary machine has created that and it's most clearly on display in the jungle so hopefully i'll make it out alive if not this will be the last conversation we had so i really deeply appreciate it do you think as i mentioned before there's other alien civilizations out there intelligent ones when you look up at the skies i deeply wanna believe that the answer is yes i do find the kind of where i i find the fermi paradox very very puzzling i find it scary that intelligence is not good at handling yeah it's very scary powerful technologies but at the same time i think i'm pretty confident that there's just a very large number of intelligent alien civilizations out there it might just be really difficult to travel through space very possible and it also makes me think about the nature of intelligence maybe we're really blind to what intelligence looks like and maybe ai will help us see that it's not as simple as iq tests and simple puzzle solving or something bigger what gives you hope about the future of humanity this thing we've got going on this human civilization i think the past is like a lot i mean if we just look at what humanity has done in a not very long period of time you know huge problems deep flaws lots to be super ashamed of but on the whole very inspiring gives me a lot of hope just the trajectory of it all yeah that we're together pushing towards a better future it is you know one one thing that i wonder about is is is agi gonna be more like some single brain or is it more like the sort of scaffolding in society between all of us you have not had a great deal of genetic drift from your great great great grandparents and yet what you're capable of is dramatically different what you know is dramatically different and that is not that's not because of the biological change it is because i mean you got a little bit healthier probably you have modern medicine you eat better whatever but what you have is this scaffolding that we all contributed to built on top of no one person is going to go build the iphone no one person is going to go discover all of science and yet you get to use it and that gives you incredible ability and so in some sense they're like we all created that and that fills me with hope for the future that was a very collective thing yeah we really are standing on the shoulders of giants you mentioned when we were talking about theatrical dramatic ai risks that sometimes you might be afraid for your own life do you think about your death are you afraid of it i mean i like if i got shot tomorrow and i knew it today i'd be like oh that's sad i like don't you know i want to see what's going to happen yeah doctor what a curious time
