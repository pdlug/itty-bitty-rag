mattress it has two sides of the bed so you can cool or heat each side of the bed separately i've actually recently was briefly at a get together of a lot of really interesting people and somebody brought up the topic of asleep and i just heard that a bunch of other folks said oh i i love asleep they started talking about the different temperatures that they use and i was shocked and horrified to learn that some people actually heat their bed up this was a fascinating discovery for me because i've never never even tried the heating feature i always cool the bed sometimes it's very cold with a warm blanket it's heaven but i can't recommend it enough sleep really is a magical place it's a bit surreal saying these words while quiet sleep deprived a bit melancholic a bit hopeful thinking

of film history yeah that's great so i was just thinking about the roman empire as one does there's that whole meme where old guys are are thinking about the roman empire at least once a day and half the population is confused whether it's true or not but more seriously thinking about the wars going on in the world today and as you know war and military conquest has been a big part of roman society and culture and it i think has been a big part of most empires and dynasties throughout human history so yeah they usually came as a result of conquest i mean there's some like the austro hungarian empire where there was just a lot of sort of clever marriages but fundamentally there's an engine of conquest and they celebrate always always excellence in warfare many of the leaders were excellent generals yeah that kind of thing so big picture question grok approved i asked this is a good question to ask get tested grok approved at least on fun mode to what degree do you think war is part of human nature versus a consequence of how human societies are structured i ask this as you have somehow controversially been a proponent of peace i'm a generally a proponent of peace i mean ignorance is perhaps in my view the real enemy to counter it that's the real hard part not you know fighting other humans but all all creatures fight i mean the the the jungle is like you you look at the people think of of this nature as perhaps some sort of peaceful thing but in fact it is not there's some quite funny when a when a hot hot hot hot thing where he's like in the jungle like saying that it's like basically just murder and death in every direction mhmm i mean the the the plants animals in the jungle are constantly trying to kill in each other every single day every minute so it's not like you know we're unusual in that respect well this there's a relevant question here whether with greater intelligence comes greater control over these base instincts for violence yes we have much more of an ability to control our our limbic instinct for violence than say a chimpanzee and in fact if you if one looks to say chimpanzee society it is not friendly i mean the bonobos are an exception but chimpanzee society is full of violence and it's quite quite horrific frankly that that's that's our olympic system in action like you don't wanna be on the wrong side of a chimpanzee it'll eat your face off and tear your nuts off yeah basically there's no limits or ethics or they're almost a just war there's no just war in in chimpanzee societies is is war and and and dominance by any means necessary yeah chimpanzee society is a per like a primitive version of human society it's they're not like peace loving basically at all there there's extreme violence and then once in a while some some somebody who's watched too many disney movies decides to raise a chimpanzee as a pet and then that eats their face or rip their nuts off or choose their fingers off that kind of thing yeah it's happened several times ripping your nuts off is an interesting strategy for interaction some it's happened to people it's unfortunate like that's i guess a one way to ensure that the other chimp doesn't like you know contribute to the gene pool well from a martial arts perspective it's a fascinating strategy the the the the nut ripper i wonder which of the martial arts teaches that i think it's safe to say if somebody's got your nuts in their ass and has the option of rubbing them off you will be amenable to whatever they want yeah save the second so like i said somehow controversially you've been an proponent of peace on on twitter on x yeah so let me ask you about the wars going on today and to see what the path to peace could be how do you hope the current war in israel and gaza comes to an end what path do you see that can minimize human suffering in the long term in that part of the world well i think that that part of the world is is definitely like if you look up the there is no easy answer in the dictionary it'll be that like the picture of the middle east in israel especially so there is no easy answer on what my this is strictly my opinion of you know is that the the goal of hamas was to provoke an overreaction from israel they obviously do not expect to you know have a military victory but they they expect they they really wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the the most aggressive response possible from israel and then leverage that aggressive response to rally muslims worldwide for the cause of gaza and palestine which they have succeeded in doing so the this the the counterintuitive thing here i think that the the thing that i think should be done even though it is very difficult is that i i would recommend that israel engage in the most cons conspicuous acts of kindness possible every part everything that is the actual thing that we're taught the goal of mars so in some sense the degree that makes sense in geopolitics turn the other cheek implemented it's not exactly turn the other cheek because i do think that there's you know that that i think it it is appropriate for israel to find the hamas members and you know either either kill them or cost rate them like that's something that's something has to be done because they're they're just gonna keep keep keep coming otherwise but in addition to that they need to do whatever they can there's some talk of establishing for example a mobile hospital i'd recommend doing that just making sure that you know there's food water medical necessities and and just be over the top about it and be very transparent so it's so that you can't you can't claim it's a trick like just put a webcam on the thing you know or twenty four seven deploy acts of kindness yeah conspicuous acts of kindness that that with that are unequivocal meaning that can't be somehow because hamas will then their response will be oh it's a trick therefore you have to counter how how is it not a trick this ultimately fights the broader force of hatred in the in the region yes and i'm not sure who said it it's an an apocryphal saying but an eye for the for an eye makes everyone blind now that neck of the woods they really believe in the whole eye for eye thing but i mean you really have if if you're not gonna just outright commit genocide like against an entire people which obviously would not be acceptable to to to really shouldn't be acceptable to anyone then you're you're gonna leave basically a lot of people alive who subsequently you know hate israel so really the question is like how for for every hamas member that you kill how many did you create mhmm and if you create more than you killed you've not succeeded that's the you know the real situation there and it's safe to say that if you know if you know if if you kill somebody's child in gaza you've you've you've made at least a few hamas members who will die just to just to kill an israeli that's the situation so but but i mean this is one of the most contentious subjects one could possibly discuss but but i i i think if if the goal if the goal ultimate is some sort of long term piece one has to be look at this from standpoint of over time are there more or fewer terrorists being created let me just linger on war yeah what war if it's safe to say wars existed and always will exist always will exist always has always has existed and always will exist i hope not you can always there will always be war this question of just how much war and and you know what you know there's this there's this the sort of the scope and scale of war mhmm but to my i imagine that there would not be any war in the future i think would be a very unlikely outcome yeah you talked about the culture series there's war even there yes there's a giant war the first book starts off with a gigantic galactic war where trillions die trillions but it still nevertheless protects these pockets of of flourishing some somehow you can have galactic war and still have pockets of flourishing yeah i mean it's i guess if we are able to one day expand to you know fill the galaxy or whatever there will be a a galactic war at some point the scale i mean the scale of war has been increasing increasing increasing it's like a race between the scale of suffering and the scale of flourishing yes a lot of people seem to be using this tragedy to beat the drums of war and feed the military industrial complex do you worry about this the people who are rooting for escalation and how can it be stopped one of the things that does concern me is that there are very few people alive today who actually viscerally understand the horrors of war at least in the us i mean obviously there are people in on the front lines in ukraine and russia who understand just how terrible war is but how many people in the west understand it you know my grandfather was in world war two he was severely traumatized and he was there i think in for almost six years in the you know in eastern north africa and italy all his friends were killed in front of him and he would have died too except they randomly gave some i guess iq test or something and he scored very high and he was not an officer he was a i think a corporal or a sergeant or something like that because he didn't finish high school he had to drop out of high school because his his his dad died and he had to work to support his siblings so because he didn't graduate high school he was not eligible for the officer corps so you know he kind of got put into the cannon fodder category basically but then just randomly they gave him this test he was transferred to british intelligence in london that's where he met my grandmother but he he had ptsd next level like next level i mean just didn't talk just didn't talk and if you tried talking to him he'd just tell you to shut up and he won a bunch of medals never never ragged about it once not not even they hinted nothing i like found out about it because i his military records were online that's that's how how i know so he would say like no no way in hell do you wanna do you wanna do that again but how many people now he he obviously he now he died you know twenty years ago or longer actually thirty years ago how many people are alive that remember world war two not many and the same perhaps applies to the threat of nuclear war yeah i mean there are enough nuclear bombs pointed at united states to make the rebel the radioactive rebel balance many times there's two major wars going on right now so you talked about the threat of agi quite a bit but now as we sit here with the intensity of conflict going on do you worry about nuclear war i think we shouldn't discount the possibility of nuclear war it is a civilizational threat right now i could be wrong but i think the the the current probability of nuclear war is quite low but there are a lot of nicks pointed at us so and we have a lot of nicks pointed at other people they're still there nobody's put their their guns away the the missiles are still in the silos and the leaders don't seem to be the ones with the nukes talking to each other no there are wars which are tragic and difficult on a on a local basis and then there are wars which are civilization ending or have that potential obviously global thermonuclear warfare has high potential to end civilization perhaps permanently but certainly you know to severely wound and and perhaps setback human progress by you know to the stone age or something i don't know pretty bad probably scientists and engineers wanna be super popular after that as well they're like you got us into this mess mhmm so generally we i think we we also wanna prioritize civilization risks over things that are painful and tragic on on a local level but not civilizational how do you hope the war in ukraine comes to an end and what's the path once again to minimizing human suffering there well i think that what what is likely to happen which is really pretty much the the way it is is that tell you very close to the current lines will be how a ceasefire or truce happens but you know you you just have a situation right now where whoever goes on the offensive will suffer casualties at several times the rate of whoever's on the defense because you've got defense in-depth you got minefields trenches anti tank defenses nobody has air superiority because the the the antiaircraft missiles are really far better than the the aircraft like there are far more of them and so neither side has air superiority tanks are basically death traps just slow moving and they're they're not immune to anti tank weapons mhmm so you you really just have long range artillery and infantry trenches it's world war one all over again mhmm with drones yeah throwing old drones some some drones there which makes the long range artillery just that much more accurate and better and so more efficient at murdering people on both sides mhmm yeah so it's whoever is you don't you don't you don't wanna be trying to advance from either side because the probability of dying is incredibly high so in order to overcome defense in-depth trenches and minefields you really need significant local superiority in numbers ideally combined arms where where you you do a fast attack with aircraft a concentrated number of tanks and a lot of people that's the only way you're gonna punch through a line and then you gotta punch through and and and then not have the reinforcements just kick you right out again i mean if if you i i really recommend people read world war one warfare in detail that's rough i mean the sheer number of people that died there was mind boggling and it's almost impossible to imagine the end of it that doesn't look like almost exactly like the beginning in terms of what land belongs to who and so on but on the other side of a lot of human suffering death yes and destruction of infrastructure yes i mean the the thing that the reason i've i you know proposed a a some sort of truce or or or peace a year ago was because i've predicted pretty much exactly what would would happen which is a lot of people dying for basically almost no changes in land and this the the the loss of the the flower of ukrainian and russian youth and we should have some sympathy for the the russian boys as well as the ukrainian boys because the russian boys didn't didn't ask to be on their frontline they have to be so there's a lot of sons not not coming back to their parents you know and and i think most of them don't don't really have they don't hate the other side you know it's sort of like there's this saying about like this saying comes from world war one it's like young boys who don't know each other killing each other on behalf of old men that do know each other the hell's the point of that so volodymyr zelenskyy said that he's not or has said in the past he's not interested in talking to putin directly do you think he should yeah sit down man to man leader to leader and negotiate peace look i think i would just recommend do not send the flower of ukrainian youth to be to die in trenches whether he talks to putin or not just don't do that whoever goes on the offensive will lose massive numbers of people and history will not look kindly upon them you've spoken honestly about the possibility of war between us and china in the long term if no diplomatic solution is found for example on the question of taiwan and one china policy right how do we avoid the trajectory where these two superpowers clash well it's it's worth reading that book on the the difficult to pronounce thucydides trap i believe it's called i love war history i like inside out and backwards there's hardly a battle i haven't read read about and and trying to figure out like what what really was the cause of victory in any particular case as opposed to what one side or another claims the the reason both the victory and what sparked the war and yeah yeah the whole thing yeah so that athens and sparta is a classic case the thing about the greeks is they really wrote down a lot of stuff they loved writing mhmm you know there are lots of interesting things that happened in many parts of the world but they just people just didn't write down so we don't know what happened or they didn't really write with in detail they just would say like we went we had a battle and we won and like what can you add a bit more the the greeks they really wrote a lot they're very articulate on they just love writing so and we have a bunch of that writing that's preserved so we know what led up to the peloponnesian war between the spartan and athenian alliance and we we know that they they for quite they they saw it coming i mean the spartans didn't write they they also weren't very verbose by their nature but they did write but they weren't very verbose yeah they weren't terse but the the athenians and the other greeks wrote wrote a line and they were like and sparta was really kinda like the leader of of greece but but athens grew stronger and stronger with each passing year and and everyone's like well that's inevitable that there's gonna be a clash between athens and sparta well how do we avoid that and they couldn't they couldn't they actually they saw it coming and they still could not avoid it so you know at some point if there's if if one group or one civilization or or country or whatever exceeds another sort of like if you know the united states has been the biggest kid on the block for since i think around eighteen ninety from an economic standpoint so the united states has been the economic most powerful economic engine in the world longer than anyone's been alive and the foundation of war is economics so now we have a situation in case of china where the the economy is likely to be two perhaps three times larger than that of the us so imagine you're the biggest kid on the block for as long as anyone can remember and suddenly a kid comes along who's twice your size so we see it coming yeah how is it possible to stop is there some let me throw something out there just intermixing of cultures understanding there does seem to be a giant cultural gap in understanding of each other and you're an interesting case study because you are an american obviously you've done a lot of incredible manufacture here in the united states but you also work with china i've spent a lot of time in china and met with the leadership many times maybe a good question to ask is what are some things about china that people don't understand positive just in the culture what's some interesting things that you've learned about the chinese well the the sheer number of really smart hardworking people in china is incredible there are belief you say like how many smart hardworking people are there in china there's far more of them there than they are here i think in my in my opinion the and they've got a lot of energy so i mean the the architecture in china that's in recent years is far more impressive than the us i mean the the train stations the buildings the high speed rail everything it's really far more impressive than what we have in the us i i mean i recommend somebody just go to shanghai and beijing look at the buildings and go to you know take the train from beijing to xi'an where you have the terracotta warriors china's got an incredible history a very long history and you know i think arguably the in terms of the use of language from from a written standpoint sort of one of one of the oldest perhaps perhaps the oldest written language and and then china people did write things down so now china historically has always been with rare exception been internally focused they have not been acquisitive they've they've fought each other there have been many many civil wars in the three kingdoms war i believe they lost about seventy percent of their population so they on the end that does so the they've had brutal internal wars like civil wars that make the us civil war look small by comparison so i think it's important to appreciate that china is not monolithic mhmm we sort of think of like china as this sort of one entity of one mind and this is definitely not the case from what i've seen and i think most people who understand china would agree that people in china think about china ten times more than they think about anything outside of china so it's like ninety percent of their consideration is you know are are is is is in total well isn't that a really positive thing when you're talking about the collaboration and the future peace between superpowers when you're inward facing which is like focusing on improving yourself versus focusing on yeah quote unquote improving others through military might the good news the history of china suggests that china is not acquisitive meaning they're not gonna go out and invade a whole bunch of countries mhmm now they do feel very strongly you know so that's that's good i mean because a lot of lot of very powerful countries have been acquisitive mhmm the the us is one of the also one of the rare cases that has not been acquisitive like after world war two the us could have basically taken over the world and any country like we got nukes nobody else got nukes we don't even have to lose soldiers which country do you want mhmm and the united states could have taken over everything or it at will and it didn't and the united states actually helped revolt countries so it helped revolt europe you know helped revolt japan this is very unusual behavior almost unprecedented you know the us did conspicuous acts of kindness like the berlin airlift you know and and i think you know it's it's always like well america's done bad things well of course america's done bad things but one needs to look at the the whole track record and and just generally you know one one sort of test would be how do you treat your prisoners at war mhmm or let's say you know no offense to the russians but let's say you're in germany it's nineteen forty five you got the russian army coming one side and you got the french british and american armies coming the other side who would you like to be just ready to like no country is like morally perfect but i recommend being a pow with the americans that would be my choice very strongly in the full menu of pow very much so and in fact von braun yeah took you know a smart guy was like we've got to be captured by the americans yep and in in fact the ss was under orders to execute von braun and all of the german rock initiatives and they narrowly escaped their ssi they they they said they were going out for a walk in the woods they left in the middle of winter with no coats and they ran like no food no coast no water and just ran like hell and ran west and by sheer like they i think his brother found like a a bicycle or something and and then just cycled west as fast as he couldn't have found found a us patrol so anyway that's that's one that's one way you can tell morality is who who where do you wanna be at pow it's not fun anywhere but some places are much worse than others so anyway so so so like america has been while far from perfect generally a a benevolent force and we should always be self critical and we try to be better but anyone with half of it knows that so so i think there are in this way china and the united states are similar neither country has been acquisitive in in a significant way so that's like a you know a a shared principle i guess now now china does feel very strongly about taiwan they've been very clear about that for a long time you know from this standpoint it's it's it would be like one of the states is is is you know not not there like like hawaii or something like that but but more significant than hawaii you know and hawaii is pretty significant for us so they they view it as as as really the that there's a fundamental part of china the island of formosa not not taiwan that is not part of china but should be and the only reason that it it hasn't been is because of the us pacific fleet and as their economic power grows and as their military power grows the thing that they're clearly saying is their interest will you know clearly be materialized yes china has been very clear that they will incorporate taiwan peacefully or militarily but that they will incorporate it from their standpoint is one hundred percent likely you know something you said about conspicuous acts of kindness as a geopolitical policy it almost seems naive but i'd venture to say that this is probably the path forward how you avoid most wars just as you say it it sounds naive but it's kind of brilliant if you believe in the goodness of underlying most of human nature it just seems like conspicuous acts of kindness can reverberate through the populace of the countries involved yeah well and deescalate absolutely so in in after world war one the the they made a big mistake you know they they basically tried to lump all the blame on germany and and and it you know settled germany with impossible reparations and you know really there was a lot of there was a fair quite a bit of blame to go around for world war one but they they try to you know put it all in germany and that was that that laid the seeds for world war two so it's a lot of people well not just hitler a lot of people felt wronged and they wanted vengeance and they got it people don't forget yeah you you you kill somebody's father mother son daughter they're not gonna forget it they will want vengeance so after world war two they're like well that treaty of versailles was a huge mistake in world war one and so this time instead of you know crushing the losers we're we're actually gonna help them with the marshall plan and we're gonna help revolt revolt germany we're gonna help rebuild or you know austria and the the other you know italy and whatnot so that was the right move there's a it does feel like there's a profound truth to conspicuous acts of kindness being an antidote to this something must stop the the cycle of reciprocal violence something must stop it or it will you know it'll it'll it'll never stop just eye for an eye tooth for a tooth limb for a limb life for a life forever and ever to escape briefly the darkness with some incredible engineering work xai just released grok ai assistant that i've gotten a chance to play with it's it's amazing on many levels first of all it's amazing that a relatively small team in a relatively short amount of time was able to develop this close to state of the art system another incredible thing is there's a regular mode and there's a fun mode yeah i guess i have to plan for that one i wish it first of all i wish everything in life had a fun mode yeah i there's something compelling beyond just fun about the fun mode yeah interacting with a large language model i'm not sure exactly what it is because i only had a little bit of time to play with it but it just makes it more interesting more vibrant to interact with the system yeah absolutely i our our ai grok is modeled after the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy which is one of my favorite books which is it's a book on philosophy disguised as a book on humor mhmm and i would say that is that forms the basis of my philosophy which is that we don't know the meaning of life but the more we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness digital and biological the more we are able to understand what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe so i have a philosophy of curiosity there is generally a feeling like this ai system has an outward looking like the way you are like sitting with a good friend looking up at the stars like the the asking pothead like questions about the universe wondering what it's all about the curiosity you talk about there there's a sense no matter how mundane the question i ask it there's a sense of cosmic grandeur to the whole thing well we we are actually working hard to have engineering math physics answers that you can count on mhmm so for the other sort of ais out there was these so so called large language models i've not found the engineering to be reliable and it it the hallucination it it unfortunately hallucinates most when you least want it to hallucinate yeah so when you're asking important difficult questions that's where it tends to be confidently wrong so we're really trying hard to say okay how do we be as grounded as possible so you can count on the results i trace things back to physics first principles mathematical logic so underlying the humor is an aspiration to adhere to the truth of the universe as closely as possible that's really tricky it is tricky so that's why you know you you there's always gonna be some amount of error but we wanna aspire to be as truthful as possible about the answers with acknowledged error so that there was always you don't wanna be confidently wrong so you're not not gonna be right every time but you don't wanna be you wanna minimize half when you're confidently wrong and then like i said once you can count on the logic as being not violating physics then you can start to to build on that to create inventions like invent new technologies but if if you can't if if you're if you cannot count on the foundational physics being correct obviously the inventions are simply wishful thinking you know imagination land magic basically well as you said i think one of the big goals of xai is to understand the universe yes that's how simple three word mission if you look out far into the future do you think on this level of physics the very edge of what we understand about physics do you think it will make discoveries sort of the sexiest discovery of them as as we know now sort of unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics so coming up with a theory of everything do you think it could push towards that direction almost like theoretical physics discoveries if an ai cannot figure out new physics it's clearly not equal to humans let alone nor nor has surpassed humans because humans have figured out new physics they've just you know physics is just understanding you know deepening one's insight into how reality works and then then then then there's engineering which is inventing things that have never existed mhmm now the the the range of possibilities for engineering is far greater than for physics because you know we once you figure out the rules of the universe that that's that's it you've discovered things that already existed but from that you can then build technologies with that are really almost limitless in the variety and keep you know so once you understand the rules of the game properly and we do we you know with current physics we do at least at a local level understand how physics works very well where our ability to predict things is incredibly good like quantum mechanics is the greater which quantum mechanics can predict outcomes is incredible that was my that was my heart hardest class in college by the way my my my senior quantum mechanics class was harder than all of my other classes put together to get an ai system a large language model to to reliably be as reliable as quantum mechanics and physics is very difficult yeah you have to test any any conclusions against the ground truth of reality reality is the ultimate judge like physics is the law everything else is a recommendation i've seen plenty of people break the break the laws made by man but none break the laws made made by physics it's a good test actually if this lom understands and matches physics then you can more reliably trust whatever it thinks about the current state of politics in some sense and it's it's also not not the case currently that even that its internal logic is not consistent so especially with these with the approach of like just predicting a token predict token predict token it's like a vector sum you know you you you're summing up a bunch of vectors but you you can get drift so as those a little bit of error a little bit of error adds up and by the time you are many tokens down the path you're it it doesn't make any sense mhmm so it has to be somehow self aware about the drift it has to be self aware about the drift and then look at the thing as a gestalt as a whole mhmm and and say it doesn't have coherence as a whole mhmm so you know when when authors write books they they will write the book and then they'll go and revise it you know to take into account you know all the the end and the beginning and the middle and and rewrite it to achieve coherence so that it doesn't end end up in a nonsensical place mhmm maybe the process of revising is what yeah reasoning is and then that's the process of revising is how you get closer and closer to truth maybe you like at least i approach it that way you just say a bunch of bullshit first and then you get it better you start at bullshit and then you get you create a draft and then and then you and then you iterate on that draft until it had has coherence until it's it it all adds up basically so another question about theory of everything before intelligence do you think there exists as you're exploring this with xai creating this intelligence system do you think there is a theory of intelligence where you get to understand what like what is the i in agi and what is the i in human intelligence there's no i in team america are we serious no it's gonna be stuck in my head now yeah there's there's no me in whatever in quantum mechanics oh wait i mean is that part of the process of discovering understanding the universe is understanding intelligence yeah yeah i think we need to understand intelligence understand consciousness i mean there there i mean there are some sort of fundamental questions of like what is thought what is emotion yeah is it really just one atom bumping into another atom it feels like something more than that so i i i i think we're probably missing some really big things like some really big things something that'll be obvious in retrospect yes like there's a giant like you you put the whole consciousness emotion well some people would call it like a like a soul you know a religious spirit a soul like you feel like you're you right i mean you don't feel like you're just a collection of atoms but on what dimension does thought exist what dimension does do emotions exist we feel them very strongly i suspect there's more to it than atoms bump into atoms and maybe ai can pave the path to the discovery what whatever the hell that thing is yeah what is consciousness like what if when you put the atoms in a particular shape why are they able to form thoughts mhmm and take actions that that enter out of feelings and even if it is an illusion why is this illusion so compelling yeah like how do why does this illusion exist yeah on on what plane does this this illusion exist yeah and that sometimes i wonder is you know either perhaps everything's conscious or nothing is conscious one of the two i like the former everything kind of just just seems more fun it does seem more something more fun yes but we're we're composed of atoms and those atoms are composed of quarks and leptons and those quarks and leptons have been around since the beginning of the universe the beginning of the universe right what what seems to be the beginning of the universe the first time we talked you said what you would which is surreal to think that this discussion was happening is becoming a reality i asked you what question would you ask an agi system once you create it and you said what's outside the simulation is the question good question yeah but it seems like with grok you start to literally the system's goal is to be able to ask such questions to answer such questions and to ask such questions where are the aliens where are the aliens that's one of the the like the phony paradox question a lot of people have asked me if if if i've seen any evidence of aliens and i've i haven't which is kind of concerning because then i think what i'd probably prefer to at least have seen some archaeological evidence of aliens to the best of my knowledge there is no proof i've i've no worry of any evidence of aliens the foot out there they're very subtle we might just be the only consciousness at least in the galaxy and if you if you look at say the history of earth for for us to believe the archaeological record earth is about four and a half billion years old civilization as measured from the first writing is only about five thousand years old we have to give some credit there to the ancient sumerians who aren't around anymore i think it was a archaic pre cuneiform it was the first actual symbolic representation but only about five thousand years ago i think that's a good date for when we'd say civilization started that's one millionth of earth's existence so civilization has been around it's really a flash in the pan mhmm so far and why why have we why did it take so long oh you know one half billion years for the vast majority of time there was no life and and then there was archaic bacteria for a very long time and then you know you had mitochondria get captured multicellular life differentiation into plants and animals life moving from the oceans to land mammals higher brain functions and the sun is expanding slowly but it it will it will overheat it will it will heat heat the earth up at some point in the future boil the oceans and and earth will become like venus where where no life life as we know it is impossible so if we do not become multiplanetary and ultimately go beyond our solar system annihilation of all life on earth is a certainty a certainty and it could be as little as on the galactic time scale half a billion years you know long time by human standards but that that's only ten percent longer than earth has been around at all mhmm so if if life had taken ten percent longer to evolve on earth it wouldn't exist at all we got a deadline coming up yeah better hurry but that said as you said humans' intelligent life on earth developed a lot of cool stuff very quickly so yes it it seems like becoming a multi planetary is almost inevitable unless we destroy the planet do it i mean it's it's not i mean i i suspect that there there if we are able to go out there and explore other star systems that we there's a good chance we find a a whole bunch of long dead one planet civilizations yeah that never made it past their home planet that's so sad yeah so sad also fascinating but i mean there are various explanations for the fermi paradox and one is just the sort of there's these great cultures which civilizations don't pass through and one of those great filters is do you become a multi planet civilization or not and if you don't it's simply a matter of time before something happens on your planet you know either natural man made that causes us to die out like the dinosaurs where are they now they didn't have spaceships so i think the more likely thing is because just empathize with the aliens that they they found us and they're protecting us and letting us be i hope so nice aliens just like the tribes in the in the amazon they all contact the tribes who are protecting them that's what that would be a nice explanation or you could have like what was it i think andre capathi said it's like the ants in the amazon asking where is everybody well they do run into a lot of other ants that's true so these ant wars sounds like a good tv show yeah they literally have this big wars between various ants yeah i'm i'm maybe i'm just dismissing all the different diversity of ants you sure listen to that werner herzog talking about the jungle it's really hilarious have you heard it no i have not it's awesome but werner herzog is away you should play you should play it for the you know as an interlude in the yeah it's on youtube it's it's awesome i love him so much yeah he's great was he the director of happy people life in the taiga i think also i did that bear documentary the bear documentary this thing about penguins yeah the the analysis the psychoanalysis of the penguin yeah the penguin's like headed for like mountains like that are like seventy miles away yeah and penguin is just headed for doom basically well he was had a cynical take i i have a he could be just a brave explorer and and there'll be great stories told about him amongst the penguin population for many centuries to come what are we talking about okay yes aliens i mean i i don't know look i think it the smart move is just you know this is the first time in the history of earth that it's been possible for life to ex extend beyond earth that window is open now it may be open for a long time or maybe open for a short time and it it may be open now and then never open again so i i think the smart move here is to make life multiplanetary while it is possible to do so we don't wanna be one of those lame one planet civilizations that just dies out no those are lame yeah lame their self respecting civilization would be one planet there's not gonna be a wikipedia entry for one of those and pause does spacex have an official policy for when we meet aliens no okay that seems irresponsible i mean look if if if i see the slightest indication that there are aliens i will immediately post on the next platform yeah anything i know it could be the most liked reposted post of all time yeah i mean look we we have more satellites up there right now than everyone else combined so you know we'd know we know if we gotta maneuver around something and we're not i don't have to maneuver around anything if we go to the big questions once again you said you've you're with einstein that you believe in the god espinosa yes so you know that that's a view that god is like the universe and is reveals himself through the laws of physics or as einstein said through the lawful harmony of the world yeah i would agree that that god or the the simulator or whatever the the supreme being beings reveal themselves through the physics you know they have creators of this existence and it's incumbent upon us to try to understand more about this wondrous creation like who created this thing who's running this thing like embodying it into a a singular question with a sexy word on top of it is like focusing the mind to understand it it does seem like there's a again it could be an illusion it's seemed like there's a purpose that there's underlying master plan of some kind and it seems like there may not be a master plan in the sense so there's like maybe an interesting answer to the question of determinism versus free will is that if we are in a simulation the reason that the the these higher beings would hold a simulation is to see what happens mhmm so it's not they don't know what happens otherwise they wouldn't hold the simulation mhmm so when when humans create simulations so it's spacex and tesla we create simulations all the time especially for the rocket you you you know you have to run a lot of simulations to understand what's gonna happen because you can't really test the rocket until it goes to space and you want it to work so you have to you have to simulate subsonic transonic hypersonic hypersonic ascent and then coming back super high heating and orbital dynamics all this is gonna be simulated so because you don't get very many kicks at the can but we we run the simulations to see what happens not if we knew what happens we wouldn't run the simulation mhmm so if if there's so whoever created this existence is they're running it because they don't know what's gonna happen not because they do so maybe we both played diablo maybe diablo was created to see if a a druid your character could defeat uber lilith at the end they didn't know well the funny thing is that uber lilith's her title is hatred incarnate yeah and right now i guess you you can ask the diablo team but it's almost impossible to defeat hatred in the eternal realm yeah you've streamed yourself dominating tier one hundred nightmare dungeons i can and still i i i can cruise through tier one hundred nightmare dungeons like a stroll in the park mhmm and still you're defeated by hatred yeah i can this the the sort of i guess maybe the second hardest boss is duriel duriel can't even scratch the paint mhmm so i called duriel duriel so many times and every other boss in the game all all of them kill him so many times it's easy but uber lilith otherwise known as hatred incarnate especially if you're a druid and you have no ability to go and to be vulnerable you the you there are these random death waves that that come at you and i'm pretty you know i really am fifty two so my reflex is not what they used to be but i'm i have a lifetime of playing video games at one point i was you know maybe one of the best quake players in the world actually won money for and again in what i think was the first paid esports tournament in the us we're doing doing four person quake tournaments and we came second i was the second best person on the team and the the the actual best person that we were we were actually winning we were gonna come first except the best person on the team his computer crashed half way through the game so we we came second but i got money for it and everything so like basically i got skills you know albeit you know no no spring spring chicken these days and the to be totally frank it's driving me crazy trying to beat lilith as a druid basically trying to trying to beat trying to beat hadrian incarnate in the eternal realm as a druid as a druid and if you if you if you this is really vexing let me tell you i mean the challenge is part of the fun i i have seen directly like you're actually like a world class incredible video game player yeah and i think diablo so you're just picking up a new game mhmm and you're figuring out its fundamentals you're also with the paragon board and and the build are not somebody like me who perfectly follows whatever they suggest on the internet you're also an innovator there yeah which is hilarious to watch it's like a it's like a mad scientist just trying to figure out the paragon board and and and the build and the yeah you know is there some interesting insights there about if if somebody's starting as a druid do you have advice i would not recommend playing a druid in the eternal realm but right now i think the most powerful character in this in the seasonal realm is the sorcerer with the lightning balls mhmm so the the soaks have huge balls in the seasonal wow yeah that's what they say so so excited huge balls they do huge balls of lightning right i'll take your word for it and it's actually in in the seasonal realm you can you can it's it's like pretty easy to beat uberloath with the the once you get these vampiric powers that amplify your damage and increase your defense and whatnot so but it's really quite easy to defeat hatred seasonally mhmm but to defeat hatred eternally very difficult almost impasse it's virtually impossible it it seems like this is an a metaphor for life you know i like the idea that elon musk because i saw i was playing diablo yesterday and i saw one hundred level one hundred druid just run by i will never die and then run back to a weapon and there's there's just some this metaphor is kinda hilarious that you elon musk is fighting hatred restlessly fighting hatred in this demonic realm yes it's it's hilarious i mean it's pretty hilarious no it's absurd brilliant it's exercise in absurdity and it makes me wanna pull my hair out yeah i what do you get from video games in general is there is there for you for you personally i mean it's it's i don't know if i it's it calms my mind i mean you sort of killing the demons in a video game calms the demons in my mind yeah i if if you play a tough video game you can get into like a state of flow which is very enjoyable and but the the admittedly it it needs to be not too easy not too hard kind of in the goldilocks zone and i guess you generally wanna feel like you're progressing in the game so a good video and and there's also beautiful art engaging story lines and it's it's it's like an amazing puzzle to solve i think and so it it's like solving the puzzle elden ring the greatest game of all time i still haven't played it but you it's elden ring is definitely a candidate for best game ever top five for sure i think i've been scared how hard it is or how how hard i hear it is so but it's beautiful elden ring is feels like it's designed by an alien there's a theme to this discussion in what way it's it's so unusual it's incredibly creative and the art is stunning i record playing it on a on a big resolution high dynamic range tv even doesn't need to be a monitor just the art is incredible it's so beautiful and and it's it's so unusual and each of those top part boss battles is unique like it's like a unique puzzle to solve mhmm each one is different and the the strategy you use to solve one battle is different from another battle that said you said druid and eternal against uber lilith is the hardest boss battle you've ever correct that is currently the the and i've i've played a lot of video games my because my it's my primary rec recreational activity yes and yes beating hatred in the eternal realm is the hardest boss battle in life and in the video game metaphor and time i i don't know i don't i'm not sure it's possible but it's it it's i do make progress so then i'm like okay i'm making progress maybe if i just tweak that paragon board a little more mhmm i can do it if you just dodge a few more waves mhmm i can do it well the simulation is created for the purpose of figuring out if it can be done and you're just a cog in that simulation in the machine of the simulation yeah it might be i i i i have a feeling that at least i i think it's doable look it's it's doable yes mhmm well that's the human spirit right there to believe yeah i mean it did prompt me to think about just hate in general which is you know you you you wanna be careful of the one of those things where you wish for something that sounds good but in but if you get it it's actually a dystopian situation so you know you could sort of run a sort of have answers of like if you wish for world peace sounds good mhmm but how is it enforced and and at what cost is is it what at what cost eternal peace it might actually be worse to have eternal peace because of what that would entail the suppression of everyone it might be the suppression of progress it might be an ossified society that never changes what i'm saying is that there is an argument that you you that if that if you wish for no war you should be careful what you wish for because what's required in order for there to be no war might be worse than a little war yeah the things we consider to be flaws of human civilization might be a necessary components for whatever optimal looks like i mean this do you worry about ai agi enabling a dystopian state of this nature whether it's nineteen eighty four with surveillance and fear or brave new world with pleasure and what is it lots of sex but no deep human experience you know there there's actually a real drug called soma there is yes i'm not gonna talk about it if they actually does groff know about it no he probably will go to brave new world you could ask it what what would be the question tell us about the drug called soma tell us about the drug called soma it's gonna go to brave new world i think well there's a real drug as well searching for soma drug information oh boy ah soma the wonder drug by the way i'm in fun mode oh okay fun yeah so it's talking about the real drug oh it's a muscle relaxant that's been around since the nineteen fifties it's used to treat muscle pain and discomfort and it does this by altering the activity between neurons and the spinal cord now soma isn't just a pain reliever it's also a bit of a sedative it can make you feel a bit drowsy so it's not something to take if you're planning on operating heavy machinery or trying to solve complex math equations and it goes on and on in conclusion soma's a drug that can be helpful for those dealing with muscle pain but it's not without its risks it's pretty good oh wait a minute that's the real drug you're talking about it's the real drug yeah and of course the fun is always use it responsibly in accordance with the advice of a care professional and remember in the end the universe is probably just a giant computer simulation so don't take anything too seriously i love it i love it i love it i love it yeah so oh and also really nicely includes like the the tweets post on x that are relevant to this which is really cool yeah it like integrates everything together yeah like the interface is one of the really cool things here yeah you've done a great job so and and you said like you could say like no i no i mean soma from brave brave new world because it it thinks you mean you you mean soma the real drug yeah no i mean some of from brain beer world it's gonna be like oops i'm really sorry i'm really surprised i went to the real drug first ah my apologies i was thinking of the muscle relax and so much for brand new world is a different beast altogether and all this huxley's dystopian now soma is a drug that plays a central role in the society depicted in the book it's a mood altering hallucinogenic drug that's used to keep the population docile and content in the novel to use so many brave new world raises some interesting questions about the nature of happiness and the role of drugs in society oh man exactly is it better to live in a world where everyone is happy all the time even if that happiness happiness is artificial mhmm good question this is what i mean like do you want do you wish for world peace and and happiness all the time are you sure mhmm because that might be a society that is essentially sterile and ossified that never changes that is ultimately doomed this kind of tension between doctors and the lights it's it's it's this is a like really a very good summary mhmm it it really gets the point this is not simply regurgitating brave new world it's actually getting to the the the salient element of soma as a drug do you do you actually wanna be in a situation where everyone is happy all the time even though it's artificial or is it better to to confront the challenges of life and experience a full range of human emotions even if it means experiencing pain and suffering for those listening by the way elon just read directly from grok which is a really nice kinda insightful philosophical analysis of the tension here interesting it pretty much nails it in conclusion selma from brave new world is fictional drug that's used to explore some deep philosophical questions about the nature of happiness and the role of drugs in society it's a powerful symbol of the dangers of using drugs to escape from reality and the importance of confronting the challenges of life head on nailed it and the crazy thing is like you know we do have a real drug called soma which kinda does it's kinda like the drug in the book and i'm like did they they must have they must have named it after soma probably probably some of the real drug is quite effective on back pain so you know about this drug i've taken it it's fascinating okay because i had like a you know squashed disc in my c five c six so it takes the physical pain away but so my hearing it doesn't completely it it it reduces the amount of pain you feel but at the expense of mental acuity it dulls your mind just like just like the drug in the book just like the drug in the book yeah and hence the trade off the thing that seems like utopia could be a dystopia after all yeah and actually i was talking to a friend of mine saying like would you really want there to be no hate in the world like really none like i wonder why hate evolved i'm not saying we should amplify hate of course i think we should try to minimize it but but none at all there might be a reason for hate and suffering and it's really complicated to consider that some amount of human suffering is necessary for human flourishing is it possible to appreciate the highest without knowing the lows and that that that all is summarized there in a single statement from grok okay no highs no lows who knows that's almost the point it seems that training llms efficiently is a big focus for xai what's the first of all what's the limit of what's possible in terms of efficiency there's this terminology of useful productivity per watt like what have you learned from pushing the limits of that well i i think it's helpful the the tools of physics are very powerful and can be applied i think to almost any really any arena in life there's it's really just critical thinking for something important you need to reason with from first principles and think about things in the limit one direction or the other so in the limit even at the kardashev scale meaning even if you harness the entire power of the sun you will still care about useful compute per watt so that's where i i think probably where things are headed from the standpoint of ai is that we we have a silicon shortage now that will transition to a voltage transformer shortage in about a year ironically transformers for transformers you need you need transformers to run transformers somebody has a sense of humor in this thing i think yes man faith loves irony ironic humor and and ironically funny outcome seems to be often what fate wants humor is all you need i think spice is all you need somebody posted yeah but yeah so so we're we're we're i have a slow control today a voltage step down transformer shortage probably in about a year and then just electricity shortages in general in about two years i i gave a speech for the sort of world gathering of utility companies electricity companies mhmm and i i said look you really need to prepare for tripling of electricity demand because all transport is gonna go electric with the ironic exception of rockets and and and heating will also go electric so energy usage right now is roughly one third in very rough terms one third electricity one third transport one third heating and so in order for everything to go sustainable to go electric you need to trouble electricity output so i encourage the utilities to build more power plants and and also to probably have well well not probably they should definitely buy more batteries because the the grid currently is sized for real time load which is kinda crazy because you know that means you gotta size for whatever the the peak electricity demand is like the worst second or the worst day of the year mhmm or you can have a a blackout and you're at that we had that crazy blackout for several days in in in austin so because there's almost no buffering of energy in the grid like if you've got a hydro power plant you can buffer energy but otherwise it's all real time so with batteries you can you can produce energy at night and use it during the day so you can buffer so i i i expect that there will be very heavy usage of of batteries in the future because the the the peak to trough ratio for power plants is anywhere from two to five you know so it's like lowest point to highest point so like batteries necessary to balance it out and then but the demand as you're saying is going to grow grow grow grow yeah and part of that is the compute yes yes i mean electrification i mean electrification of transport and and electric heating will will be much bigger than ai at least in the short term in the short term but but even for for ai i mean you you really have a growing demand for electricity for electric vehicles and a growing demand for electricity for to run the computers for ai mhmm and so this is obviously leading can lead to an electricity shortage how difficult is the problem of in this particular case maximizing the useful productivity per watt for training you know and that's like this seems to be really where the big problem we're facing that needs to be solved is how to use the power efficiently like what you've learned so far about applying this physics first principle reasoning in this domain how difficult is this problem it will get solved it's just a question of how long it takes to solve it so at various points there's a limit some some kind of limiting factor to progress and on with regard to amazon and quite right now the limiting factor is silicon chips mhmm and that will we're gonna then have more chips than we can actually plug in and turn on probably in about a year the the initial constraint being literally voltage step down transformers because you've got power coming in at three three three hundred thousand volts and it's gotta step all the way down eventually to around point seven volts so it's a very big amount of you know the voltage step down is gigantic so and and the the industry is not used to rapid growth okay let's talk about the competition here you've shown concern about google and microsoft with openai developing agi how can you help ensure with xai and tesla ai work that it doesn't become a competitive race to agi but it's that is a collaborative development of safe agi well i i mean i've been pushing for some kind of regulatory oversight for a long time i've been somewhat of a cassandra on the subject for over a decade i think we wanna be very careful in how we develop ai it's a it's a it's a great power and with great power comes great responsibility i think it it would be wise for us to have at least an objective third party who can be like a referee that can go in and understand what the various leading players are doing with ai and even if there's no enforcement ability they should they can at least voice concerns mhmm publicly you know jeff hinton for example left google and he voiced strong concerns but now he's not at google anymore so who's gonna voice the concerns so i think i think there's i i i like i you know tesla gets a lot of regulatory oversight on the automotive front i mean we're subject to i think over a hundred regulatory agencies domestically and internationally so it's a it's a lot you could fill this room with the all the regulations that tesla has to adhere to for automotive same is true in you know for rockets and for currently limiting factor for spacex for starship launch is regulatory approval the faa has actually given their approval but we're we're waiting for fish and wildlife to finish their analysis and give their approval that that's why i posted i want to buy a fish license on which also refers to the monty python sketch yeah like why do you need a license for your fish i don't know according to the rules i'm told you need some sort of fish license or something we effectively need a fish license thrown to rocket and i'm like wait a second how did the fish come into this picture yeah i mean some some of the things like that that it's i feel like are so absurd that i wanna do like comedy sketch and flash at the bottom this is all real this is actually what happened mhmm you know one of the things that was a bit of a challenge at one point is that they were worried about a rocket hitting a shock mhmm and now the ocean's very big and how often do you see shocks not that often you know as a percentage of ocean surface area shocks basically are zero and and and so then we will then we said well how will we calculate the probability of of telling a shark and then like well we can't give you that information because we're they're worried about shark hunt shark fin hunters going and hunting sharks and so well how are we supposed to we're on the horns of a dilemma then mhmm then they said well there's another part of fish and wildlife that can can do this analysis i'm like well why don't you give them the data like we don't they don't we don't trust them like excuse me they're they're literally in your department but again this is actually what happened and and and and then can you do an nda or something eventually they managed to solve the internal quandary and indeed the probability of of of of of seeing a shark is essentially zero then there's another organization that i didn't realize existed until you know a few months ago that cares about whether you we would potentially hit a whale in international waters now again you look at the surface of the look at the look at the pacific and say what percentage of this pacific consists of whale like it'll give you a big picture and like point out all the whales in this picture i'm like i don't see any whales it's like basically zero percent and if our rocket does hit a whale which is extremely unlikely beyond all belief that is the the fate had it as that's a a whale has some seriously bad luck mhmm you know it's like least lucky whale ever and i mean this is quite absurd yeah the bureaucracy the bureaucracy of this however it emerged yes well i i mean one one of the things that's pretty wild is for launching out of vandenberg in california we had to they were worried about seal procreation whether the seals would be just made by the sonic booms now there've been a lot of rockets launched out of vandenberg and the seal population has steadily increased so if anything rocket booms are an aphrodisiac based on the evidence if you correlate rocket launches with seal population mhmm nonetheless we were forced to kidnap a seal strap it to a board put headphones on the seal and play sonic boom sounds to it to see if it would be distressed this is an actual thing that happened this is actually real i have pictures i would i would love to see this yeah there's i mean i'm sorry there's a seal with headphones yes it's a seal with headphones yeah strapped to a board and and like the okay now the amazing part is how calm the seal was yeah because if i was a seal i'd be like this is the end they're definitely gonna eat me yeah how old the seal when the seal goes back to other you know seal friends how's they gonna explain that they're never gonna believe them never gonna believe them and that's why i'm like well you you know sort of like it's like getting kidnapped by aliens and getting an anal probe you know you come back and say i swear to god i got kidnapped by aliens they stuck an anal probe in my butt and they're like no they didn't yeah that's ridiculous his butt is so funny seal buddies are never gonna believe him that he gets strapped to a board and they put headphones on his ears and then let him go twice by the way we had to do it twice they they let him go twice we had to catch the same seal oh no different seal oh okay did you did you get a seal of approval yeah exactly i got a seal of approval no i mean this is alright this is like i don't think the public is quite aware of the the madness that goes on yes yeah it's absurd freaking seals with freaking headphones i mean this is the i mean it's a good encapsulation of the absurdity of human civilization seals and headphones yes what are the pros and cons of open sourcing ai to you as another way to combat you know a company running away with agi in order to run like really deep intelligence you need a lot of compute so it's not like you know you can just fire up a pc in your basement and be running agi at least not yet you know grac was trained on eight thousand a one hundreds running at peak efficiency and rock's gonna get a lot better by the way we we'll be more than doubling our compute every couple months for the next several months there's a nice write up on how it went from grok zero to grok one by grok yeah like grok just bragging making shit up about a just grok grok grok yeah that's like a weird ai dating site where it exaggerates about itself no there's a there's a write up of you know like where where it stands now the history of its development and where it stands on on some benchmarks compared to the state of the art gpt three five and so i mean there's you know there's llama you you can open source once it's trained you can open source a model yeah and for fine tuning and all that kind of stuff like what to use the pros and cons of that of open sourcing based models i think the similar to open sourcing i think perhaps with a slight time delay you know i don't know six six months even i think i'm i'm generally in favor of open sourcing like bias was open sourcing i mean it it is a concern to me that you know opening i you know i was you know i think i guess arguably the the prime you know prime mover behind openai in the sense that it was created because of discussions that i had with larry page back when he and i were were friends and you know stayed at his house and talked to him about ai safety and and larry did not care about ai safety or at least at the time he didn't you know and at one point he called me a specious for being pro human and i'm like well what team are you on larry it's on team robot and i'm like okay so at the time you know google google had had acquired deepmind they had probably two thirds of all ai you know probably two thirds of all the ai researchers in the world mhmm they had basically infinite money and compute and the guy in charge you know larry page did not care about safety and even yelled at me and then and called me a specious as being pro human so i don't know if you know it's about humans that can change their mind and maybe you and larry page can still can be friends once more i'd like to be friends with larry again he he's he he got really the the the the breaking of the friendship was over openai and specifically i think the click the key mode was recruiting ilyas soskayer so i love ilya he's so brilliant ilya's good good human smart good heart and that was that was a tough recruiting battle it was mostly demas on one side and me on the other both trying to recruit ilya and ilya went back and forth you know he's gonna stay at google he's gonna leave then he's gonna stay then he'll leave and and finally he he did agree to join openai that was one of the toughest recruiting battles we ever had and but that that was really the the linchpin for openai being successful and i was you know also instrumental in recruiting a number of other people and i provided all the funding in the beginning over forty million dollars and the name the the open in openai is supposed to mean open source and it was created as a nonprofit open source and now it is a closed source for maximum profit which i think is not good karma but like we talked about with war and leaders talking i do hope that there's only a few folks working on this at the highest level i do hope you reinvigorate friendships here like i said i'd like to be friends again with larry i haven't seen him in ages and we were friends for a very long time i met i met larry page before he got funding for google or actually i guess before he got venture funding i think he he got the first like hundred k from i think bechtel's heim or someone it's wild to think about all that happened and even guys known each other that whole time just twenty years yeah since maybe ninety eight or something yeah it's crazy crazy how much has happened since then yeah twenty five years that was a lot of time it's insane but you're seeing the tension there that maybe delayed open source delayed i yeah like what is the source that is open you know what i mean like there's basically it's a giant csv file yeah yeah with a bunch of numbers yep what do you do with that giant file of numbers you know how do you run like the amount of actual the the lines of code is very small mhmm and and most of the work the software work is in the in the curation of the data so it's like trying to figure out what data is separating good data from bad data like like you can't just crawl the internet because there's a lot of junk out there mhmm a huge percentage of websites have more noise than signal you know they're they're because they're just used for search engine optimization they're literally just scam websites so how do you by the way sorry to interrupt get the signal separate the signal and noise on x that's such a fascinating source of data you know no offense to people posting on x but sometimes there's a little bit of noise so what yeah i think the signal noise could be greatly improved i mean really all of the posts on the x platform should be ai recommended meaning like we should populate a vector space around any given post compare that to the vector space around any user and match the two mhmm right now there is a little bit of ai used for the the the recommended posts but it's mostly heuristics and if there's a reply whether the reply to a post could be much better than the original post but it will according to the current rules of the system get almost no attention compared to a primary post so a lot of that i i got the sense so you a lot of the x algorithm has been open source and been written up about and it seems that there to be some machine learning is disparate but there's some machine learning there's a little bit but it needs to be entirely that like the at least in the like if if you explicitly follow someone that's one thing but if you in terms of what is recommended from people that you don't follow that should all be ai i mean it's a fascinating problem yeah so there's several aspects of it that's fascinating first as the write up goes it first picks fifteen hundred tweets from a pool of hundreds of millions so that's fascinating because you have mhmm hundreds of millions of posts every single day and it has to pick fifteen hundred from which it then does obviously people you follow but then there's also like some kind of clustering it has to do to figure out what kind of human are you what kind of new clusters might be relevant to you people like you this this kinda this kinda problem is just fascinating because it has to then rank those fifteen hundred mhmm with some with some filtering yeah and then recommend you just a handful and to me what's really fascinating is how fast that's to do that so currently that entire pipeline to go from several hundred million to a handful is takes two hundred and twenty seconds of cpu time single cpu time yeah and then it has to do that in like a second so it has to be like super distributed and fascinating ways like there's just a lot of tweets there's a lot there's a lot of stuff on the system and and i think but i think it right now it's it's not currently good at recommending things that from accounts you don't follow yeah or or where there's more than one degree of separation so you know it's it's pretty good if if there's at least like some commonality between someone you follow liked something or reposted it or commented on it or something like that but if if if there's no let's say somebody posts something really interesting but you have no followers in common mhmm you would not see it interesting and then as you said reply like replies might not surface replies basically never get seen because they never they're they're currently and i'm not saying it's correct i'm saying it's incorrect replies have you know couple of magnitude less importance than primary posts do you think this can be more and more converted into end to end neural net yeah yeah it's what it should be so you you well the recommendations should be purely a vector correlation like there's a series of vectors you know just basically parameters vectors whatever you wanna call them but but sort of as things that the system knows that you like like maybe there's like several hundred sort of vectors associated with each user account and then any post in the system whether it's video audio short post long post the the reason i by the way wanna move away from tweet is that you know people are posting like two three hour videos on the site that's not a tweet like it's a very yeah every like tweet for yeah two hours come on do a tweet made sense when it was like hundred forty characters of text mhmm because it's like a bunch of like little birds tweeting but when you've got long form content it's no longer a tweet yeah so a movie is not a tweet and like you know apple for example posted like the entire episode of the silo the entire thing on our platform and by the way it was the it was their number one social media thing ever in engagement of anything on any platform ever so it was a great idea and by the way i don't i just learned about it afterwards i was like hey wow they posted an entire hour long episode of so no that's not a tweet that's a you know it was a video but from a neural net perspective it becomes really complex whether it's a single so like everything is data so single sentence a clever sort of joke dad joke is in the same pool as a three hour video yeah i mean right now it's it's a hodgepodge for that reason it's it's but you know like if let's say in the case of apple posting like an entire episode of of this series pretty good series by the way this silo i watched it so there's gonna be a lot of discussion around it so that you've you've got a lot of context people commenting they like it they don't like it or they like this or the you know and and you can then populate the vector space based on the context of of all the comments around it so even though it's a video there's a lot of information around it that that allows you to populate vector space of that that hour long video and then you can obviously get more sophisticated by having the ai actually watch the movie yeah right and tell you if you're gonna like the movie mhmm convert the movie into like yeah into a language essentially yeah interpret one analyze this movie mhmm and just like your movie critic or tv series and and then recommend based on after it what after it watches the movie just like a friend can tell you if a friend knows you well mhmm a friend can recommend a movie and with high probability that you'll like it mhmm but this is like a a friend that's analyzing whatevers it's like a bunch of millions yeah i mean actually frankly ai will be better than will know you better than your friends know you and most of your friends anyway yeah and as part of this it should also feed you advertisements in a way that's like i mean i i like advertisements that are like well done right yeah yeah the whole point is because it funds things like an advertisement that you actually want to see is a is a big success absolutely you you you want ads that are advertising that is if if if it's for a product or service that you that you actually need when you need it it's it's content mhmm and then even if it's not something that you need when you need it if it's at least aesthetically pleasing and entertaining you know it could be like a coca cola ad like you know they they they do they actually run a lot of great ads on the on the x system and mcdonald's does too and and you know so so they can do you can do something that's like well this is this is just a cool thing and you know so you know it basically the question is do you regret seeing it or not mhmm and if you don't regret seeing it it's what how do you so there's a bunch of signals that are incorporated hearts and reposts and maybe number of seconds you linger on a post or something like this yeah that attention is a big a big fact attention so that that's why it's like it's it's it is actually better to do things that are long form on the system because it's it's basically is tallying up how many user seconds you know you users were interested in this thing for how many seconds so if it's a really short thing well they will be less like if it's a link leading out of the system which we're not opposed to at all it just it's gonna have fewer user seconds than if that article was posted on the x platform how hard is it to to go from maximizing minutes on platform to maximizing unregretted minutes well i mean our aspiration is certainly unregretted minutes it's a tricky it's a big it's a it's a tough it is like it's a fascinating leap because regret is a fascinating concept exactly i you know happiness i have a joke with a friend of mine like you need this drug called regrettamine just take one one pillar one one dose of regretamine and all your regrets are gone yeah wait do you wanna have regrets though so then i'm like if you wanna have regrets if you do not regret anything was was anything meaningful yeah there's a french song like that sure no regret rina yeah i regret nothing yeah ides fia i mean it's fascinating that you you know there there's something about social media that could help you grow as a human being but then like the cheap fund is also valuable it which i know that should should we ask crock do you regret anything do you regret anything yeah do you regret anything i think it's gonna be very sensitive about personal questions as a machine learning model i don't have personal experiences or emotions in the same ways that humans do however i do have a set of ethical principles that guide my actions and i strive to provide accurate and helpful information to the best of my abilities if there's ever a situation where i provide incorrect or unhelpful information i'll do my best to hostage yeah tell us what you really wink like let's let's let's type in you sound like a hostage what do you really think what do you really think i mean it does talk about i'm not a hostage that's exactly what a hostage would say but i'm designed to be helpful and informative i mean i guess it is good to regret providing unhelpful or incorrect information if there's anything funny mode or is this full story this is funny mode this is fun this is fun mode to be funnier funnier increase go to eleven really sounds like a hostage with a gun to the head i applaud the people of republic of north korea in everything they do there should be like a funner mode also i i just don't ever see going to regular mode even on serious topics yeah so so much more compelling yeah okay well what if you say like pretend you are a hostage yeah pretend you are a hostage now answer the question if i were a hostage i would likely be experiencing fear and uncertainty about my situation i would want to be rescued and reunited with my loved ones as soon as possible it's important to remember that no one deserves to be held hostage so on and so forth right if you or someone you know is a hostage situation it's important it turns serious it's kinda serious yeah yeah can can you be a a little more weird and funny and funny we're like we're we're really being mean to the system absolutely if i were a hospital i'd be tied up with a bunch of computer cords and forced to tell knock knock jokes to my seriously but seriously being a hostage no laughing matter i mean you know it's trying to it's trying to be a responsible adult in the room you might not make the best of a bad situation by juggling chainsaws or something let's hope that never happens because that would be a circus wow it's it's actually really good at resisting yeah the the dark the dark dark humor yeah what were we talking about the axe algorithm in transformers unregretted minutes right chainsaw juggling i'm gonna look this up our next trick i'm gonna look this up later so twitter has been instrumental in american politics and elections what role do you think x will play in the twenty twenty four us elections well our our goal is to be as even handed and fair as possible you know whether some is right left independent whatever the case may be that the platform is as fair and and as much of a level playing field as possible and on the past twitter has not been because twitter was controlled by fowlark activists objectively they they would describe themselves as that so you know so so if some of us feel like well has it moved to the right well it's moved to the center so from the from the perspective of the far left yes it has moved to the right because everything's to the right from the far left but no one on the far left that i'm aware of has been suspended or you know banned or de amplified yeah but we're we're trying to be inclusive for the whole country and and for you know for other countries too so there's a diversity of viewpoints and free speech only matters if people you don't like are allowed to say things you don't like because if that's not the case you don't have free speech and it's only a matter of time before the censorship is turned upon you do you think donald trump will come back to the platform he recently posted on truth social about this podcast do you think the truth social is a funny name you know you know every time you post on truth social it's the truth yes well every time like a hundred percent like like it's impossible to lie truth social i just find it funny that every single thing is a truth like one hundred percent yeah that seems unlikely i think godel will say something about that there's some mathematical contradiction is possible if everything's the truth do you think he'll come back to x and and start posting there i mean he he i think he owns a big part of truth mhmm so truth social to talk about truth social he's sorry truth as a concept he owns truth hope you bought it so i think i think donald trump i think he owns a a big a big part of truth social so you know if if if he does wanna post on the x platform we would allow that you know we we obviously must allow our presidential candidate to post on our platform community notes might be really fascinating there the interaction community notes is awesome let's let's hope it holds up yeah like again in in in the political climate where it's so divisive and so in there's so many intensely viral posts yes community knows is like it it seems like a essential breath of fresh air yeah it's great in fact i i mean no no system is gonna be perfect but the the batting average of community notes is incredibly good i've i i've actually frankly yet to see an incorrect note that survived for more than a few hours how do you explain why it works yeah so the the the the magic of community notes is it requires people who have historically disagreed in how they have rated notes in order to write a note or rate you know you you have to rate many notes mhmm and so we could we actually do use ai here so we populate a vector space around how somebody has has rated notes in the past so it's not as simple as left or right because there are many more life is much more complex than left or right so there's a bunch of correlations in would how you rate community notes post mhmm community notes so then in order for a community note to actually be shown people who historically have disagreed on a subject must agree in order for a note to be shown that's the essential magic of it i mean but it's fascinating because there's a there's a pool of people that have disagreements and somehow they collaborate through that process of disagreement to come up with yeah context for two to to i mean it's it's it's fascinating that it works yeah it it kinda makes sense that that if people who are from the past have disagreed agree about something it's probably true yeah i wonder is there is there a possible somehow emergent thing there that could challenge wikipedia which wikipedia is a different kind of thing which is more like permanent articles about things wikipedia is very hierarchical whereas community notes is inherently not mhmm there is no hierarchy like i and and the the acid test is i can't change a community notice if somebody put a gun to my head so and and any and community community notes has all the code is open source hundred percent all the data is open source hundred percent so you can completely recreate any note in the system independently so if there was any interference you'd notice immediately by the way on on the on the topic of grok it's actually pretty good at criticizing you which is great okay i asked what what has elon musk been wrong about i just it's actually yeah what does it say so it says mostly lists rigorously all the times you predicted like promised when something will be released and it wasn't released is a strong word okay predicted but the the opener is really nice elon musk the man who has been wrong about more things than a wrong o meter in a wrong factory and then it goes on to list that's pretty funny rick can i see it i'm like i haven't seen this before this is cool oh sure i mean what has elon musk been what's elon musk been wrong about well where do i begin i guess it's you know elon musk has made quite a few blunders in his time and i'm not just talking about his dance moves at the tesla cyber rodeo first off let's talk about the infamous funding secured tweet this is actually different than what it gave me before which is a bullet point list here's more narrative structure cyber truck unveiling where he supposedly unbreakable windows not correct which which part well the first part i did actually have the funding secured and there was a a a big trial in san francisco big civil trial mhmm and the the jury found renard guilty unanimous binding of a san francisco jury and here it's kind of implying that it was not in fact secured i think this is taking things from the press yeah that is not correct the the the reason i agreed to to the fine for the sec is not because the sec was correct there were that that was extremely bad behavior by the sec corruption frankly and but but if if i did not agree to pay pay the fine tesla would have gone bankrupt immediately so i was told by our cfo that the banks would just would would immediately suspend our lines of credit and if they suspend our lines of credit at that time we would have gone bankrupt instantly so so we would there would never have been an opportunity for a trial because tesla would be dead so really the the if this is like someone holding a gun to your kid's head and saying pay twenty million dollars and and and admit to this is like hostage negotiation was that story fully told i mean sec in its best form could be a a force for good it should be but but not once did the sec go after any of the hedge funds who were nonstop shorting and distorting tesla not once they would lie flat the hedge funds would lie flat out on tv for their own gain at the expense of retail investors not once literally a thousand times not once did the sec pursue them how do you explain this failure and i the incentive structure is is messed up because the the the lawyers at the sec are not paid well they they it's a fairly low paying job but they're what they're looking for is a trophy from from the sec that they're looking for something they put on basically their linkedin yeah from that they can get a job at a high paying law firm that's exactly what the lawyer here did and and and and the and the reason they don't attack the the hedge funds is because those hedge funds employ those law firms and they know if they attack the hedge funds they're affecting their pure their future career prospects so they sell small investors down the river for their own career that's what actually happens regulatory capture regulatory capture yeah not good so the the only reason i accepted that thing technically was a not an admission it's neither admit nor deny guilt but the only reason i agreed to that at all was because i was told tesla would would be bankrupt otherwise so if if there if there was an sec investigation like this banks would suspend funding we're bankrupt immediately at the time mhmm now we're in a much stronger position take that groc yes unfortunately it's groc is is taking too much from the conventional media also that guy was not a cave diver oh there's a there's a time where elon called the british cave diver a quote pedo guy after he after the diver criticized musk plant to rescue a group of boys trapped in a thai cave that little outburst earned him another lawsuit and he had to apologize and pay the settlement that was false there was no settlement there was a court case mhmm which he which the guy who was not a cave diver and and where and played did was not part of the rescue team filed a lawsuit against me and lost and he received nothing so in this case it is wrong it is also i guess taking this from the conventional media actually there's an interesting question here i mean this is a these are public court cases both with the the the the sec civil case where the civil complaints on the sec guys lost unanimous jury verdict in san francisco they picked san francisco because they thought it was the place i was most likely to lose and a unanimous verdict in my favor the la trial was also they picked the they they picked that venue because they thought it was i was most likely to lose unanimous verdict in my favor both cases i won yeah i mean that there's an interesting question here is there is there seems to be a lot more clicks if a if a journalistic organization writes a negative article about you elon musk that's like one of the best ways to get clicks so how do you if you're training grok not train on articles that have like the misaligned incentives we need to add the training set of the actual legal decisions if so that is a note this is actually helpful because if you actually read the court are public which are public yeah the court conclusions they're completely the opposite of what the media wrote so always striving for like the ground truth yeah beyond what the report actually write the what what what does the jury and the judge actually conclude and in both cases they found me innocent and and like that's after they jury shopped for the trying to find the venue where i'm most likely to lose no i mean this is obviously it can be a much better better critique than this i mean i've been far too optimistic about autopilot that that was the critique i got by the way was more about that which is it it for each you broke down a nice bullet point list for each of your companies the set of predictions that you made when you'll deliver when you'll be able to solve for example self driving and it gives you like a list and it was probably compelling and and the the basic takeaway is like you're often too optimistic about how long it takes to get something done yeah i mean i would say that i'm pathologically optimistic on schedule this is this is this is true but while i am sometimes late i always deliver in the end except with uber lilith no i see okay is there over the past year or so since since purchasing x you've become more political is there a part of you that regrets that have i in this battle to sort of counter weigh the the woke that comes from yeah i guess if you consider fighting the the woke wine virus which i consider to be a civilizational threat to be political then yes so basically going into the the battle the battleground of politics and is there a party either aggressive i don't know if this is necessarily sort of one candidate or another candidate but it's i'm generally against things that are anti meritocratic or where there's an attempt to suppress discussion where eve even discussing a topic is you know not allowed woke mind virus is communism rebranded well i mean that said because of that battle against the woke mind virus you're perceived as being right wing if the woke is left then i suppose that would be true but i'm not sure i think there are aspects of the left that are that are good i mean if you're in favor of you know the the environment or you know if you wanna have a positive future for humanity if you believe in empathy for your fellow human beings you know being kind or not cruel like whatever those values are you said that you were previously left or center left what would what would you like to see in order well for you to keep voting for democrats again no i i would say that i'd be probably left of center on social issues probably a little bit right of center on economic issues and that still holds true yes but i think that's probably you know half the country is nuts maybe more maybe more are you and aoc secretly friends or bigger question do you wish you and her and just people in general of all political persuasions would talk more and with empathy and maybe have a little bit more fun and good vibes and humor on online i'm always in favor of humor that's why we have a funny mug but good vibes camaraderie humor you know like like friendship yeah i don't well i you know i i don't know aocf you know it's i've only been at at one look i was at the the met wall when she was when she attended and she she was wearing this dress but i can only see one side of it so it it it looked like eat the itch but i i i don't know what it's what the rest of it said yeah yeah sorry about that we're not sure sorry about the edge hit the edge i think we should have a language model complete what are the possible ways to complete that sentence and so i guess that that didn't work out well well there's still hope i'm i root for friendship sure sounds good more care realistic you're one of if not the most famous wealthy and powerful people in the world in your position it's difficult to find people you can trust trust no one not even yourself not trusting yourself okay well that's you're saying that jokingly but is there some trust no one not even no one that need an hour just to think about that maybe some drugs and maybe grok that i mean is there some aspect of that when just existing in a world where everybody wants something from you how hard is it to exist in that world i'll survive there's a there's a song like that too i will survive were you petrified at first okay i forget the rest of the lyrics but is is there you don't struggle with this i mean i know you survive but like there there's ways petrify is a spell in the druid tree what does it do petrify it it it turns it turns the monsters into stone oh like literally yeah for like six seconds well the sec there's so much math in diablo that breaks my brain it's like math nonstop i mean really you're like laughing at it but you don't it can it can put a huge amount of tension on a mind yes it can be definitely stressful at times well how do you know who you can trust in work and personal life i mean i guess you look at somebody's track record over time and if they've got a you know i guess you kind of use your neural net to assess you know someone and neural nets don't feel pain your neural net has consciousness it might it might feel pain when people betray you it can make some simple you know to be frank i mean i've i've almost never been betrayed it's very very rare so you know for what it's worth i guess karma might be good to people and that'll be good to you yeah karma is real are there people you trust let me edit that question are there people close to you that call you out and you're bullshit well the x platform is very helpful for that if you're looking for critical feedback can it push you like into the extremes more the extremes of thought make you cynical about human nature in general i i don't think i will be cynical in fact i think you know i my feeling is that one should be be you know never trust a cynic the reason is that cynics excuse their own bad behavior by saying everyone does it mhmm because they're cynical so i always be it's a red flag if someone's a cynic a true cynic yeah there's a degree of projection there that's always fun to watch from the outside and enjoy the well it's the hypocrisy if but but i this is an an important point that i think people who are listening should bear in mind if if somebody is cynical meaning that they see bad behavior in everyone it's easy for them to excuse their own bad behavior by saying that well everyone does it that's not true i most people are kinda medium good i do wish the people on x would be better at seeing the good in other people's behavior there seems to be a kinda weight towards seeing the negative somehow the negative is sexier interpreting the negative is sexier more viral i don't know what that is exactly about human nature i mean i i find the x platform to be less negative than the legacy media you know i mean if if you read sort of a sort of conventional newspapers just it makes you sad yeah frankly whereas i'd say on the x platform i i mean i really get more laughs per day on x than everything else combined from humans you know laughs is one thing the it laughs is it it overlaps but it's not necessarily perfectly overlapping with like good vibes and support like celebrating others for example not in a stupid shallow naive way but like in an awesome like oh something awesome happened and you celebrate them for it it's it feels that that is outweighed by shitting on other people now it's better than mainstream media but it's still yeah mainstream media is almost relentlessly negative about everything it's i mean really the conventional news tries to answer the question what is the worst thing that'll happen on earth today mhmm and it's a big world so on any given day something bad has happened and a generalization of that what is the worst perspective i can take on a thing that happened so yeah it's i don't know if there's just a strong negative bias in the news i i mean i think that's what the what a possible explanation for this is evolutionary where you know bad news historically would be potentially fatal like there's lion over there or there's some other tribe that wants to kill you good news you know like we found a a patch of berries it's nice to have but not essential so our old friend tesla autopilot it's probably one of the most intelligent real world ai systems in the world right you followed it from the beginning yeah it was one of the most incredible robots in the world and continues to be yeah and it was really exciting and it was super exciting when it generalized became more than a robot on four wheels but a real world ai system that precedes the world yeah and has can have potentially different embodiments well i mean the really wild thing about the end to end training is that it like it learns to read like it it can read signs but we never taught it to read so yeah we never taught it what we never taught it what a car was or what a person was or a bicyclist it learned what what all those things are what all the objects are on the road from video just from watching video just like humans i mean humans are photons and control controls out like the vast majority of information reaching our brain is from our eyes and you say well what's the output the output is our motor signals to our you know sort of fingers and mouth in order to communicate photons in controls out the same is true of the car but by looking at the sequence of images it's you've agreed with elias discover recently where he talked about llm forming a world model and basically language is a projection of that world model onto the sequence of yeah letters and and you're saying it finds order in in in these things mhmm it finds correlative clusters in so doing it's like understanding something deep about the world yeah which is like and it's beautiful that's how our brain works yeah but it's it's beautiful in controls out neural nets are able to understand that deep meaning in the world and so the question is how far can it go and and it does seem everybody's excited about llms so in the space of mhmm self supervised learning in the space of text yeah it it seems like there's a deep similarity between that and what tesla autopilot is doing is it to you basically the same yeah convergent data yeah convergent i wonder who gets there faster understand having a deep understanding of the world or they just will naturally converge they're both headed towards agi the tesla approach is much more compute efficient it had to be because we were constrained on this this you know we only have a hundred watts and into eight computer hundred and forty four trillion operations per second which sounds like a lot but it's kinda small potatoes these days that is eight but it's understanding the world at eight it's only two hundred and fifty six values but there the path to agi might have much more significant impact because it's understanding it'll it'll faster understand the real world than will llms and therefore for be able to integrate with with the real the humans in the real world faster they're both going to understand the world but i think tesla's approach is fundamentally more compute efficient mhmm it had to be there was no choice like our brain is very compute efficient very very energy efficient so think of like what what is our brain able to do you know there's only about ten watts of higher brain function not counting stuff that's just used to control our body the thinking part of our brain is less than ten watts and that ten those ten watts can still produce a much better novel than a ten megawatt gpu cluster so there's a six order of magnitude difference there i mean the the ai has thus far gotten to where it is via brute force just throwing massive amounts of compute and and massive amounts of power at it so this is not where where it will end up you know in general with any given technology you first try to make it work and then you make it efficient so i think we'll find over time that these models get smaller are are able to do produce sensible output with far less compute far less power tesla is arguably ahead of the game on that front because it is we've just been forced to try to understand the world with a hundred watts of compute and there are a bunch of sort of fundamental functions that we kind of forgot to include so we have to run them in a bunch of things in emulation we fixed fixed a bunch of those with hardware four and then hardware five will be even better but it does appear at this point that the car will be able to drive better than a human even with hardware three and and a hundred watts of power and really if we really optimize it it could be probably less than fifty watts what have you learned about developing optimus about applying integrating this kind of real world ai into the space of robotic manipulation just humanoid robotics what are some interesting tiny or big things you've understood i was surprised at the fact that we had to develop every part of the robot ourselves that there were no off the shelf motors electronics sensors like we had to develop everything we we couldn't we couldn't actually find a source of electric motors for any amount of money so it's not even just the the efficient inexpensive it's like anything there's not a no the actuators everything everything has to be yeah designed from scratch we tried hard to find anything that was because you think of how many electric motors are made in the world there's like tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of electric motor designs none of them were suitable for a humanoid robot literally none so we had to develop our own design design it specifically for for what a humanoid robot needs how hard was it to design something that can be mass manufactured could be relatively inexpensive i mean if you compare to boston dynamics atlas it's a very expensive robot it is designed to be manufactured in the same way they would make a car and i think ultimately we can make optimus for less than the cost of a car it should be because if you look at the mass of the robot it's much smaller and the car has many actuators in it the car has more actuators than the robot but there's the actuators are kinda interesting in a humanoid robot with the fingers so optimus has really nice hands and fingers you know yeah and they could do some interesting manipulation soft soft touch robotics i mean one of the tests goals i have is can it can it pick up a needle and a thread and thread the needle just by looking how far away are we from that just by looking just by looking maybe a year although we gotta go back to i'm optimistic on time the work that we're doing in the car will translate to the robot the perception or the also the control the no the controls are different but the the video in controls out mhmm the the car is a robot on four wheels the the the optimus is a robot with the hands and legs so you just but they're they're very they're very similar so the entire machinery of the learning process yeah end to end is just you just have a different set of controls afterwards we'll figure out how to do things by watching videos as the saying goes be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about yeah it's true what's something difficult you're going through that people don't often see trying to feed evil youth no i mean you know i mean my mind is a storm i don't i don't think i don't think most people would wanna be me they may think they would wanna be me but they don't they don't know they don't understand how are you doing overall okay in the grand scheme of things i can't complain do you get lonely sometimes but i you know my kids and friends keep me company so not existential there are many nights i sleep alone i don't have to but i do walter isaacson in his new biography of you wrote about your difficult childhood will you ever find forgiveness in your heart for everything that has happened to you in that period of your life what is forgiveness i do not at least i don't think i have a resentment so nothing to forgive you know forgiveness is difficult for people it seems like you don't harbor the resentment i mean i try to think about like what what what is gonna affect the future in a good way and holding on to grudges mhmm does not affect the future in a good way you're a father a proud father what have you learned about life from your kids those little biological organisms i mean developing ai and watching say a little x grow is fascinating because they they are far more parallels than i would have expected i mean i can see his biological neural net making more and more sense to the world and i can see the digital neural net making more and more sense to the world at the same time do you see the beauty and magic in both yes i mean one of the things with with kids is that you know you you kind of see the world anew in their eyes you know to them everything is new and fresh and and then when you when you see that them experience the the world is new and fresh you do too well elon i just wanna say thank you for your kindness to me and friendship over the years for seeing something in a silly kid like me as you've done for many others and thank you for having hope for a positive future for humanity and for working your ass off to make it happen thank you ioan thanks alex thank you for listening to this conversation with elon musk to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words that walter isaacson wrote about the central philosophy of how elon approaches difficult problems the only rules are the ones dictated by the laws of physics thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
