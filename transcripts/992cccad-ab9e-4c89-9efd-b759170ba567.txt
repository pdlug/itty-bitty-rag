podcast and now dear friends here's jared kushner we did a lot of this conversation before the hamas attack on israel and we decided to sit down again and finish the discussion to address the current situation which is still developing if i may allow me to summarize the situation as it stands today it's morning monday october ninth on saturday october seventh at six thirty am israel time hamas fired thousands of rockets into southern israel the rocket attacks served as cover for a multipronged infiltration of israel territory by over one thousand hamas militants this is shortly after at seven forty am the hamas militants went door to door in border towns killing civilians and taking captives including women and children in response to this israeli air force began carrying out strikes in gaza also fighting on the ground in israel to clear out hamas militants from israel territory and preparing to mobilize israeli troops for potential ground attack on hamas and gaza now of course this is what it appears to be right now and this along with other things might change because the the situation is still developing the idf is ordering civilian residents of gaza to evacuate their homes for their safety benjamin netanyahu declared war in several statements and warned israelis to brace themselves for a long and difficult war just today israeli ministers ordered a quote complete siege of gaza interrupting supplies of electricity food water and fuel from israel to gaza as of now october ninth the death toll is over twelve hundred people and over a hundred thirty hostages hostages taken to gaza by hamas so as i said the events are rapidly unfolding so these numbers will sadly increase but hopefully our words here can at least in part speak to the the timeless underlying currents of the history and as you write about the power dynamics of the region so for people who don't know gaza is a twenty five miles long six miles wide strip of territory along the mediterranean sea it borders israel on the east and north and egypt on the southwest it's densely populated about two point three million people and there's been a blockade of gaza by israel and egypt since two thousand seven when hamas took power i could just summarize that hamas is a palestinian militant group which rules the gaza strip it originated in nineteen eighty eight and it came to power in gaza in two thousand six as part of its charter it's sworn to the destruction of israel and it is designated by the united states european union uk and of course israel as a terrorist group so given that context what are your feelings as a human being and what is your analysis as the former senior adviser to the president under the trump administration of the current situation in israel and gaza so i i think you did an excellent job of summarizing a lot of the the context but watching what's unfolded over the last forty eight hours has been truly heartbreaking to see we're still in the early stages of what's developing but seeing the images on x of you know militants terrorists going door to door with machine guns gunning down innocent civilians seeing beheaded israeli soldiers seeing young twenty year olds at a rave dance party to celebrate peace with militants flying in and then you know shooting machine guns to to kill people indiscriminately seeing young children captive and and held prisoner seeing eighty year old grandmothers a holocaust survivor also being taken captive these are just images and actions that we have not seen in this world since nine eleven this is a terror attack on the scale of which we have not seen and it's been incredibly hard for a lot of people to comprehend my heart goes out obviously to all of the the families of the victims to the families of those who are held in captive now and to all of israel because one of the beautiful things about the state of israel is that when one israeli is hurting the entire nation comes together it's a shame that it's taking an action like this to unify the nation but i have seen incredibly beautiful signs over the last forty eight hours of a country coming together the jewish people have been under oppression before the jewish people know what it's like and seeing people rally together to fight for their homeland to to to try to reestablish safety is is is a very beautiful thing to watch i wish it wasn't something we had to watch but it is with that being said though the backdrop i've been speaking to friends over the last couple days i've one friend i spoke with last night who was saying that you know a good friend messaged him saying i'm going in we're gonna do some operations to try to free some of the hostages held in one of the kibbutzes messaged him the next morning he was one of the first through the door to try to free these hostages and he was killed by hamas militant and sadly we're gonna be hearing many many more stories of brave israeli soldiers trying to get these terrorists out of israel trying to free innocent civilians who unfortunately are risking their lives to do it and you know they're all heroes but some will have a less good faith than others sadly so it's a very very heartbreaking moment and i do think that it's very important at this moment in time for the entire world to stand behind israel i think that hamas has shown the entire world who they really are i think what their aim is what they're willing to do and you know all of the strong security that israel's put in place over the last years which in some instances was criticized i think is now being validated that that there was a real threat that they were looking to deter so short answer is my heart is broken praying for peace praying for strength praying for praying for israel to do what it needs to do to avoid being in this situation again which is either eliminating or severely degrading hamas's capabilities there there cannot be peace in israel and in the middle east while there's a terror group that is being funded by iran that is allowed to flourish and is allowed to plan operations that are gonna aim to kill innocent civilians and so as somebody who was formerly in this position who was intimately involved with israel with the strategies to to minimize attacks from hamas and to try to turn the region around and i think we did do a very substantial job under president trump the middle east went from one of the most chaotic regions in the world you had isis in two thousand sixteen isis had a caliphate the size of ohio they're beheading journalists they were they were they were killing christians they controlled eight million people they were planning attacks all over the world from their their caliphate they were using the internet to radicalize people we had the san bernardino shooting in america we had the pulse nightclub shooting in in in orlando and there was real threat and then you had iran which was given a hundred and fifty billion dollars in a glide path to a nuclear weapon and they were using their newfound riches to fund hamas hezbollah the houthis different rebels all over the the region that were looking to destabilize further syria was in a civil war where five hundred thousand people were killed yemen was destabilized syria libya was destabilized and it was just a mess and all of america's allies had felt betrayed president trump came into power we rebuilt the the trust and the relationships with all of our traditional allies we were able to eliminate isis the caliph territorial caliphate and then we're able to project strength in the region really go after iran's wallet we were able to stop through through crushing sanctions a lot of their financial resources which they were using to fund all these terror groups and so we left the middle east with six piece deals and and a fairly peaceful world so seeing what's happening i think it was completely avoidable i think it's horrible to see that it's occurring and i pray that those in power will make the right decisions to to to to restore safety but also to potentially create a better paradigm for peace in the future so i have a lot of questions to ask you about the journey towards this historic progress towards peace with abraham accords but first on this situation to step back and some of the history is there things about the history of hamas and gaza that's important to understand of what is happening now just your comments your thoughts your understanding of hamas i i think you did an excellent job lex of of really giving the summary just a couple things maybe i'll add to it is that hamas was originally founded from the muslim brotherhood in egypt which is a group that's caused a lot of issues in the region they've they've attacked israel many times in the past there's a lot of discussion about how israel is an occupying power well in gaza in two thousand and five they withdrew from all the land and then they say israel is an apartheid state well israel then gave governance of the region to the palestinians and then what's happened is is the palestinian people's lives have now gone down not up since then i will say that under hamas' leadership in in gaza the people who have suffered the most are the palestinian people and i see i've i've watched cries throughout my time in government from people saying we wanna see the palestinian people live a better life i agree with those people i think that the palestinian people in gaza are essentially hostages in in gaza you have basically two point you know two million people that are being held hostage by thirty thousand hamas terrorists and that's really the problem and i would just encourage people to to push their attention and energy in this moment and their anger towards hamas those are the people who are killing innocent civilians who are murdering indiscriminately and those are the people who have held back the palestinians from having a better life and just finally what i would say is you know what we saw with hamas was that if you go back to two thousand seven they basically had just one plan that they did over and over and you know we are very careful to try to monitor very closely and stop the iranian money and the resources from coming in and again we took a little bit of criticism from the international community from keeping the border tight but unfortunately every time you'd allow construction materials to go into gaza they'd use them to build tunnels not homes you would have equipment that would come in to build pipes they'd turn it into bombs so it was very very hard to figure out how do you get the resources into gaza to help people live a better life while at the same time the leadership in gaza was taking all those resources and turning it into military equipment to attack israel what role does iran play in this war in this connection to hamas it can you speak to the connection between hamas and iran that's important to understand especially as this most recent attack unfolds sure so the correlation i mean there's reports that iran is behind the attack hamas has has thanked iran for their support and and it's been very well known that iran supports the destruction of the state of israel and i won't say iran as a country i'll talk about iran in the leadership there's actually a beautiful thing i saw on the internet where at one of the soccer games in iran they were trying to you know rally support for the hamas terror attacks and a lot of people in the crowds were chanting you know f you to the regime because i think the iranian people the persian people generally are peace loving people who don't wanna see this focus on destruction and annihilation but you saw this in two thousand fifteen two thousand sixteen when the iranian government had resources the region was less safe and since you know now there's been more resources allowed to go to the iranian regime by lack of enforcement of sanctions and as a result iran is funding hezbollah hamas they were funding the houthis now there's a little bit of a detente between saudi and iran which has led to that going down which only further proves that iran was behind the houthis which is what the saudis have been saying for years and iran was denying so there's a very strong relationship between the two and we always knew that the way that iran fights wars or fights conflicts is never directly it's usually through its proxies and in this case hamas has been a a proxy for iran who wanted to obviously see the destruction of israel but also does not wanna see the israelis and the saudis come together for a peace agreement so the name of this operation of the hamas operation is al aqsa flood referring to the al aqsa mosque how much of this attack is about the al aqsa mosque in actuality i i don't think any of it is but the al aqsa mosque is is something that all of the shia jihadists have used for years in order to justify their actions that are aggressive towards israel so this is something i'll maybe even take a step back and go through when i was was working initially in my first year on the peace plan i was doing a lot of listening and quite frankly a lot of what people were saying to me didn't make sense and the reason why i was trying to figure out they were talking about sovereignty over al aqsa mosque the al aqsa mosque is a mosque that's built in the holy of holies the haram al sharif in israel where the the jewish beit hamikdash the holy temple was built in a very religious place about after the temple was destroyed then there was a big mosque built there and it's one of the more holy places in islam now so so the big thing everyone was saying is what do you do with this land where you have a mosque built over a very big jewish site and i was hearing all of the experts and you know i always say experts with quotes because only in washington can you work on something for a decade and continue to fail and then you basically leave and are considered an expert but that's one of the problems with washington which maybe we could talk about later but the notion here was i went and i said let me try to understand what the issue is with the israeli palestinian conflict with the people right i always felt the politicians were a little disconnected so i commissioned several focus groups one in in amman one in cairo one in dubai and one in ramallah and i asked you know people muslims what is the arab what is the israeli palestinian conflict about mhmm and time and time again the most popular thing that they said was that israel was not allowing access to the mosque for muslims to pray and what was interesting was is that israel's policy is to allow anyone who wants to come and pray peacefully at the sites to come and pray sometimes they have security issues when there's provocations but by and large since nineteen sixty seven when israel was able to take back jerusalem in a defensive war just to be very clear they were attacked in the south and they were attacked from from the east and they basically were able to beat back the jordanians and the egyptians and and then reconquer the old city of jerusalem and during that time immediately after israel then passed the protection of holy places law which was they basically took resources they didn't have and they said we're gonna restore the christian sites the muslim sites the the jewish sites and they've worked to allow everyone access to the mosque so today any muslim who wants to come can come and pray at the mosque the mosque is israel's acknowledged that king abdullah the king of jordan is is the custodian of of the mosque and as long as people wanna come to the country and pray peacefully they're able to do that but if you look at a lot of the propaganda that's been used by isis or iran to to recruit terrorists or to justify their incursions they often say they're doing it in the name of liberating the al aqsa mosque but from an operational and pragmatic perspective today any muslim who wants to go to the mosque you can book a flight to israel now through dubai because there's flights between israel and dubai and if as long as your country has relations with israel and they'll accept your passport in there you can come and pray and that's what israel wants israel wants jerusalem to be a place where all religions can come and celebrate together but you have a lot of actors that look to find ways to use these religious tensions in order to sow division and justify violent behavior i wonder how it's possible to lessen the effectiveness of that propaganda message that a lot of the war a lot of the attacks are about access to the al aqsa mosque is there something you can speak to why that message hasn't disseminated across the the arab world so israel's good at a lot of things they're not very good traditionally with public relations you know after the abraham accords you know we made the first abraham accords deal in august twenty twenty and then we made five other deals we first did united arab emirates then we did a deal with bahrain then we did a deal with kosovo then we did a deal with with sudan then we did deal with morocco and then we got the gcc deal done as well the deal the the tension between qatar saudi uae egypt and bahrain and that was allowing us to create a pathway to then pursue the israeli saudi normalization so we had so much momentum then that the goal was just keep getting more countries to normalize relations with israel once you create the connection between people and create the ability for people to do business together the ability for flights to fly between then you would just start naturally having people coming and everyone has a smartphone today so they can then post and combat the the misinformation that's been out there but this misinformation is not something that's new you know one of the characters who played a very big role in in spreading the antisemitism and the violence in in israel in the nineteen twenties was a guy named haj amin al husseini who was known as the grand mufti of jerusalem he was very close with hitler and mussolini and he was working with them to try to get some claims to the middle east once the jewish people were annihilated and what he did for a very long time was he did the same shtick only it was before he had smartphones and youtube where he would say the mosque is under intact these imperialist zionists are coming in to try to destroy the mosque and he would use that to raise money from indonesia from pakistan from all over the world and then use that that threat to justify recruiting you know groups of young vulnerable muslim men and then you know getting them in the name of of religious rights to go and kill people which is not which really is more of a perversion of the religion than i think the true essence of what islam is i think islam at its core is a peaceful religion and i think that's where a lot of the great leaders in islam wanna take it but the people who use islam or the the mosque or as a justification for violence those are people who i think are are really they are disrespecting the the islam religion as you said you helped make major strides towards peace in the middle east with the abraham accords can you describe what it took to accomplish this and maybe this will help us understand what broke down and led to the tragedy this week yeah so you know i always believed in foreign policy i i learned very quickly that the difference between a political deal and a business deal is that in a business deal you have a problem set you come to a conclusion and then if you buy or sell something you either have you know more cash or you have a company so it'd be more to do less to do political problem set is very different where you know the conclusion of a problem set is essentially the beginning of a new paradigm so when i would think about how do you how do you move pieces around the board you couldn't say let me just solve the problem you have to think about what happens the day after the signing and how do you create a paradigm that has positivity to it so the biggest piece of what president trump did during his four years in office was he really strengthened the relationship with israel number one and he did things like recognizing jerusalem as the capital of of israel he moved the embassy to jerusalem he recognized the golan heights he got out of the iran deal we did an economic conference in bahrain where we brought israelis to meet with you know saudi and emirati and qatari businessmen and everyone came together and and each one of these instances were unthinkable previously and everyone said that if you did it the world was gonna end and every time president trump did one the next morning the sun rose the next evening the sunset and things moved on and so by doing that what president trump did was he he slaughtered a lot of the sacred cows of these these false barriers that people had erected and showed people that the vast majority of the people in the middle east whether they're jewish muslim christian whatever religion they are they just wanna live better lives and so what we basically did was create a paradigm where the voices for peace the voices for together now finally had a forum in where they were able to do it and we did that in the backdrop the way we're able to be successful was we severely limited the resources of iran and they were focused more internally and they couldn't cause the trouble that they were causing everywhere else since we've left obviously the dynamics have changed but the the way you get to peace is obviously number one through strength and number two by finding a way for people to be better off tomorrow than they are today and what i found was that most of the the voices looking for violence or trouble were people who were just focused on what happened two years ago twenty years ago seventy years ago a thousand years ago people who are trying to solve solve those problems in that context often were were looking more to use those past grievances as a justification for their power and for the bad behavior that they were looking to perpetuate so managing as we have talked about extensively managing the power dynamics of the region and providing a plan this is something you did with the economic plan titled peace to prosperity a vision to improve the lives of the palestinian and israeli people can you first of all describe what's in the plan sure so this was something i took on i was working on the political framework between the israelis and the palestinians and trying to understand what were the issues and the issues were were not very many basically it was you had a land dispute you know so you had to figure out where do you put borders ultimately you had a security a paradigm which i was much more favorable to israel's perspective on and obviously the events of the past forty eight hours have fully justified that that that that bias and then in addition to that you had to deal with the religious sites but i felt operationally that wasn't actually as complicated as people made it because you wanted to just leave it open for everybody then i went through and i i felt that the palestinian leadership was fairly disincentivized to make a deal because there was just this paradigm where for they had billions of dollars coming in from the international community and i think that they feared that if they made a deal they would lose their relevancy internationally and the money would stop flowing into the country so what i tried to do is to say you know my my approach when i would get into a hard problem say how do i understand all the different escape hatches how do i try to eliminate them and then build a golden bridge that becomes really the the only but also the most desirable pathway for the decision makers to walk through and it wasn't always hard and sometimes you have to go and you know hold their hand or you try to pick them up and walk them across but but but a lot of these leaders are very reluctant to change and the dynamics of the palestinians also were such that i think they were fairly stuck where they were so we developed a business plan for gaza the west bank we threw in some some improvements for jordan and egypt as well i was based off of the vision twenty thirty that they did in saudi arabia which i thought was a a visionary document i went back through this process and i studied basically every economic project in post world war two period so we looked at what they did in south korea why it was successful with some strong industrial planning we looked at japan we looked at singapore we looked at poland why it was successful we spent a lot of time on the ukraine plan for the country and why it wasn't successful and that was mostly because of governance and corruption which actually resembles a lot of what's gone wrong with the palestinians where there's no property rights there's no rule of law and what we did is we built a plan to show you know it's not that that hard right in the sense that between the west bank and gaza you had five million people and and we put together a plan i think it was about twenty seven billion dollars we got together a conference i had the head of at and t we had steve schwarzman from blackstone came which is very gracious of them we had all the leading arabic businessmen the leading builders leading developers and the general consensus of that of that of that of that conference was that this is very doable you know we think that for gaza in particular it would cost maybe maybe seven to to eight billion dollars to rebuild the entire place we felt we could reduce the poverty rate in half we can create over a million jobs there mhmm the only thing that people said was holding it back wasn't israel what was holding it back was governance and people wouldn't have confidence investing there with with the rule that that hamas was was perpetuating so i encourage people actually to look at the plan it was very thoughtful it was a hundred and eighty one pages we went project by project each project is costed out it's a real plan that could be implemented but you need the right governance and all of the different arabic countries are willing to fund it the international community is willing to fund it because they've just been throwing so much money at the palestinians for years that's never been outcomes based or conditions based it's just been you know entitlement money and unfortunately it hasn't really achieved any outcomes that have been successful so it it's a great business plan it just shows to rebuilding gaza you know could be easy but like i said you know the problem that's held the palestinian people back and that's made their lives terrible in gaza has not been israel it's really been hamas's leadership or lack of leadership and their desire to focus on trying to kill israelis and start war with israel over improving the lives of the palestinian people and the current approach of hamas the more violence they perpetrate the more they can hold on to power versus improving the lives of people so they as you said maybe you can comment on they do not propose an economics plan i mean hamas has been running it now for sixteen years and they don't have a lot to show for it and you know our posture with them was basically a very simple deal you know if you think about what's the end state in gaza it's actually not that complicated it's you know there's no territorial disputes right the border's the border there's no religious issues there as well you know you're not dealing with jerusalem you're basically just dealing with the fact that you know israel wants to make sure that there's no threat from gaza so it's a demilitarization or some kind of security guarantee from a credible source where israel doesn't feel like gaza can be used to stage attacks into israel or to fire rockets into israel and by the way these are things i was saying you know three four years ago that that was the objective and that was really the fear now that's been proven you know unfortunately the fear has has manifested and in exchange you can rebuild the place and you can give the people a much better life but hamas has not shown desire for that or a capability for that and i don't think there's enough trust to allow them to do that which is why you know under the current circumstances if you do wanna have peace there hamas has to be either eliminated or severely degraded in terms of their military capabilities i would love to ask about leadership especially on the on the side of the united states what has the current administration the biden administration done different than the trump administration as you understand that may have contributed to the events we saw this week so all i can talk about are are where we left them right we left them a place where they had tremendous momentum in the middle east i met with them during the transition and said you know look you know we we even got the the qatar saudi conflict done which was a big no peace between israel and saudi would have been possible without that so we even got that done in in our lame duck period and and they came in and they said look we wanna focus on the three c's which is covid climate change and china and i said that's that's great but you know the middle east we have an amazing place right now it's stable there's momentum iran is is basically broke we put such crippling sanctions on iran that they went from about i think it was two point six million barrels a day of oil they were selling to to about a hundred thousand under trump so their their foreign current foreign currency reserves were basically depleted and they were broke same with the palestinians we stopped the funding to to to to the to to unrwa the un agency which is totally corrupt it's it's you know we've put ten billion dollars in there over time i did a poll in the middle east in gaza to say okay we've invested ten billion dollars here as a country are we popular mhmm right the us had a seven percent approval rating usaid had a seventy percent approval rating but it just felt like a waste of our taxpayer dollars and again we want to make it conditions based the biden administration came in number one they they they started insulting you know saudi and russia oil prices went up at the same time what they did was they stopped domestic production of oil they made it they disincentivized a lot of oil and shale production with regulations they they stopped pipelines oil prices went up they stopped enforcing the sanctions against iran probably to get the oil prices lower to make up for what they were doing they ran to iran to try to make a deal they started funding the palestinians again right away and i even said you know if you're gonna fund them if that's your policy i i respect that again elections have consequences and you can take a different policy but what i would recommend is get some conditions make them do some reforms make them give property rights to people make them you know do real economic investments for people but they just went right away so they were funding the palestinians not enforcing the sanctions and then overall just projecting a lot of weakness in the region so one of the the most embarrassing examples is what happened in the united arab emirates again an amazing probably one of america's best allies over the last you know twenty thirty years they fought with us in in afghanistan they were the first muslim country to stand up and do that after nine eleven because they didn't want it to be a war of the west against against the muslim muslim religion so they joined the fight because they saw it as a fight between right and wrong they have rockets shot into their country from from from from from from the houthis and they basically don't get a call from the us for seventeen days they need their equipment that they buy from the us which creates job in the us they need it restocked we don't call so they've severely degraded the trust that we had to rebuild with our allies i think they've been working now to get it back they after two years started working with with saudi and israel which i think was good you know i think that they realized after a stint that maybe the the process that president trump had created in the region was the right policy and keep in mind you know president trump's policy was that that i was working on was very strongly criticized during the first three years before we're able to achieve the results because it was departure from the failed policies of the past and so first there was return to those policies appease iran let's criticize saudi arabia then they started embracing and working on the israel saudi deal which i was was was really exciting i think we're all very excited about it but they did it in public and i think that that also was something and i didn't have access to their intelligence so i assumed that by doing it so publicly they thought that they'd either had to deal with iran because they were letting them get all this revenue where iran wouldn't be a problem but one of the reasons with the abraham accords we kept it so quiet during the whole time was because we always felt like the troublemakers in the region particularly iran who we thought would would be disadvantaged by having uae saudi israel altogether israel's a nuclear power you have you know other strong economies iran seeks instability they seek looking to create division in the region and if you can create that economic sphere where you have security from haifa to muscat from israel to oman all the way through with saudi jordan uae qatar egypt that's an incredibly powerful block if you can make it secure and then get economic integration that really could be a middle east that thrives so iran obviously wanted nothing to do with that and that's why they've been working to disrupt so i think the administration has they took an incredibly stable situation with momentum i think they underestimated the the the way that iran would approach the region to undermine i think they gave way too much rope to iran and i think that they didn't seize when they had an opportunity of strength with the palestinians to try to drive to a conclusion that i believe could have prevented us being where we are today not to mention that you know even just three weeks ago i mean it's a bad look that they they just you know basically gave six billion dollars to iran in exchange for hostages and then iran's basically funding these terror attacks they're killing american citizens you have in israel and and it's just it's a heartbreaking situation again totally avoidable and one that i think has been very badly mismanaged to date if trump was currently president you were still working with him on this part of the world what actions would you take what conversations would you have what ideas would you be working with in order to unite the the various allies that you mentioned in the middle east over this tragedy and not let it be a thing that divides the middle east but make it a thing that catalyzes progress towards peace further progress towards peace so i i wanna say one thing lex i have a lot of friends who are fans of trump who are not fans of trump but one thing i wanna say with absolute certainty is that if president trump was in office this never would have happened and when president trump was in office anyone who supports israel or who wants to see you know jewish people not be innocently slaughtered he would never have allowed that to happen it did not happen when he was in power and i hope people recognize that as as something that's that's very very true how i would play the ball where it lies right now keep in mind we we transferred the ball it was on the green now it's almost like it's gone back you know a hundred and fifty yards and it's in a sand trap i think the way that i would play the ball right now is number one is you have to show strength i actually think president biden's words were the right words i see that they're moving aircraft carriers to the region again the purpose of having a strong military i believe obviously you know if you get into a war you wanna win the war but the purpose of a very strong military primarily is to avoid a war i don't know what kind of credibility the biden administration has to show the strength but right now you have to support israel completely you have to really let people in the region know that there'll be consequences if they if they if they try to escalate again we saw a little bit of rocket skirmish from lebanon from hezbollah but again this is the type of thing that they have to know there'll be severe consequences if they make this a multiparty fight and i think sending a strong message to iran i think that they have to see some consequences from this and know that they're not gonna be allowed to have a free reign to cause instability and that you know iran doesn't usually fight face to face they usually do it through proxies but let's just all be honest about where this is coming from and let them know that there will be a consequence if they if they instigate these actions and again at least with the biden administration they've had contact with iran they've been talking with iran but they've allowed iran i mean again i the number i saw last year i think under trump the number was maybe like four or five billion dollars of oil revenue and in total i think last year it was something like forty five billion dollars in revenue this year i think there'll be even more that's a combination of them driving up oil prices but also allowing much more sales you would think that they would find a way to get them to behave and allow them to to have this happen or if that's not the case then be tough go back to being tough that's what you have to do building off of abraham accords as you mentioned israel saw any normalization there's been a lot of promising progress towards this what does it take to not allow this tragedy damage the progress towards israel saudi normalization i think right now it's probably not the best to think about that i think that we wanna think about that after whatever is gonna happen is gonna happen now i think right now the number one priority for israel has to be to fully regain security in the country and then number two is to figure out how you can like i said eliminate or degrade the hamas capability or other iranian threats to make sure that you have your security apparatus i think that the israeli leadership right now should proceed with that and i don't think that they should be thinking about normalization with saudi at this moment my instinct and i've been watching this israeli saudi normalization play out obviously just speaking with people and seeing what i've been reading and watching with great excitement i think it would be a game changer for the region i think it's it's one of iran's worst nightmares to have israel and saudi interlinked together i think it'd be great for the saudi people from a security perspective what they're discussing with america would be very strong the ability to you know get different elements across would be incredible so what i would say with it is that the industrial logic held yesterday and i think it will hold again tomorrow so you know i always expect countries to act in their interests i think that the deal that's on the table right now between saudi israel and america is in saudi's interest it's in america's interest and it's in israel's interest what's gonna happen now though is the political dynamics are gonna shift and i think that you know as we've seen with political dynamics they come and go i think let's get through this moment and then i hope at the right time that those talks will be able to resume and conclude in an appropriate way and you know it's funny lex when i was working on the us mexico agreement for the trade you know we would have every day there'd be a you know a tweet that would go out or there would be an issue i mean people forget how how intense it was between america and mexico and i would speak to my counterpart in mexico after a rough day and you know we were working on something we're making progress it'd get blown up and i'd speak to him and say you know what look they're they're not moving america they're not moving mexico let's just you know let's stop for today let's pick up tomorrow and let's find a new way to bring this forward so i would just encourage everyone working on that not to give up to keep working hard at it and to find a way but like i said i would take a little bit of a pause for the time being let's let the current situation play out and then hopefully there'll be a way for it to move forward i just hope there's still people on the us side picking up the phone and calling uae saudi arabia just as human beings as friends as allies and just keeping that channel communication going because i maybe you can correct me but i just feel like there's just simple human dynamics that play out here the divisions can form and just run away from you over simple misunderstandings over just inability to see a tragedy from the same perspective because of conversations that could have happened but didn't happen i think there'll definitely be communication but you know words on phone calls is is only worth so much it's really you know trust between people and power and obviously when you're in a position of power you represent your country and your country's interests but the ability to have trusting relationships where people feel like they're okay taking you know more risks to help each other that's actually what's most important so communication i hope for but you know deepening and trusting relationships that's what i believe makes progress and keeps people safe and we talk quite extensively about the value of trust and negotiation and just working with leaders which i think is a fascinating conversation and you've taught me a lot about that let me ask you about the end here what are the various trajectories this work can take in your view what are some of the end states as you've said which are desirable and are achievable i i mentioned this earlier but whenever i would get a problem set in government i'd always think through from a first principles perspective what's the logical outcome right and forget about all the reasons why it can't happen that's what everyone in governments always rush to talk about but i do think here number one israel has to have a secure environment where they don't feel threatened from from from gaza and number two is the people in gaza need to have an environment where they feel like they can live a better life and have opportunities so that's the end state and so i think that the international community should come together i do think that the people who are usually putting blame on israel should now realize that maybe they've been a little bit of harsh here and that hamas has been as big a threat if not an even bigger threat than israel has been saying and i do think that if the international community comes together and unites behind israel and really forces hamas and their iranian backers to stop hostilities to stop saber rattling to stop misrepresenting the history in order to justify their violent behavior and if they say instead we wanna hold you accountable no more money and they all say that they're gonna stand behind israel's efforts to eliminate their national security threats and then we will all come together and only fund again into a framework that we believe can be a long term solution where the palestinian people really have a chance to live a better life that's really the best way to get there there's tons of complicated factors but that's the end state that the global community should be looking to come together and it's very achievable it's very very achievable so there's a as we stand here today there's a lot of different ways that this war can evolve if a ground invasion happens by israeli forces of gaza and if the number is correct of a hundred thousand israeli soldiers do you worry about various trajectories that can take of the consequences that might have of of an unprecedented ground troop attack yeah so i think as a leader you know you can't change yesterday but you have the ability to change tomorrow and that's a very important fundamental i mean that that's true for all of us not just leaders but you know we saw with with nine eleven how america was caught off guard by a terrorist attack we acted you know somewhat rationally somewhat emotionally which led to a twenty year war with trillions of dollars lost you know the i think almost a million lives lost not just american but all lives and it was a total tragedy what occurred i think right now the temptation is to to be strong i think that that's that's a necessity i do think eliminating risk is the right objective i think the goal should be to stay very clear about what the objective is but also this attack was very well planned not to walk into another trap i think you have to be very smart very cautious i've been happy to see that what they've been doing in retaliation so far has been somewhat measured and they've taken their time to try to assess what's achievable again i don't have access to the intelligence and you know we're talking at a very early stage in this conflict so a lot could happen even by the time this is published but but my my hope is that they'll just stay very focused on what the objective is and try to make sure that they're acting appropriately in order to do that and i will say this too that this has been different than what i've seen in the past and that the the the attacks were so heinous and so so disgusting that i've seen the international community rally around israel more so than i ever have and i hope that israel continues to keep the moral high ground and continue to communicate what they're fighting for why they're fighting and i do hope that the international community supports the objective and they can work together to achieve it benjamin netanyahu bb somebody you've gotten to know well in negotiation in conversation he has made statements he's declared war he has spoken about this potentially being a long and difficult war what have you learned about the mind of benjamin netanyahu that might be important to understand here in this current war bibi is definitely a historic figure you know i'd meet with a lot of different world leaders and some of them i would say they're they're very very special transformational figures and some i would say how the hell is this person running a country and bibi is somebody who has has done a lot for the state of israel he has a tremendous understanding of the security apparatus he has tremendous global relations so for a crisis like this i think bb's the leader you want if you're israel to be to be in that seat i think he's he's ambitious in what he's gonna look to achieve he understands his role in history as somebody who's helped strengthen israel economically militarily and i don't think he wants to see his legacy be somebody who left israel more vulnerable than it had to be so i think in that regard he'll be incredibly strong but i also think that he'll hopefully be calculating in the risk that he takes and not create more risk than than is needed and that's easy to say you know the two of us sitting here having a conversation when you're sitting in that chair as a leader in the fog of war it's a very very it's a very hard decision to make he's been here before he he he knows the weight of the situation i'm sure he knows the moment and i pray that that he'll do what's right here to bring the best outcome possible i wonder if you can comment on the internal political turmoil that bboe has been operating in and how that relates to the the tragedy that we saw on the one hand the political turmoil is it's a sign of a vibrant democracy i think it's been actually nice to see how people have fought for their country and their beliefs in a democratic way you compare that to the palestinians where there's no democracy there's no free speech there's no free press you know you can't disagree with with the leadership you know in israel if you wanna you know be you know if you wanna be homosexual you can have a you can have a go to a parade and live your life in in in gaza they'll throw you off a building and kill you it's so so in israel you have the freedoms which i think make it a special place and you have a very vibrant democracy with that being said you know the times in jewish history where the jewish people have been most vulnerable have been when there's been division and that's when the temple was destroyed but that's not just with the jewish people and with israel that's in all societies so i definitely believe that this division has left them less prepared for the situation than it would i do think there's real lessons we should be taking from this here in america where we're in a time where we're very divided but i do think that it'd be very wise for our leaders to find the areas where we do agree and find ways to you know secure our southern border to make sure that we know who's in our country what risks we all face and i do think that that division definitely creates risk for countries let me switch gears here and just zoom out and look at our society and our public discourse at the moment what do you make of the scale and nature of the palestinian support online in response to this situation this is something i've observed over the years since i got involved with the israeli palestinian issue with a lot of interest i think a lot of the people who are pledging support for the palestinian people i think that they wanna see the palestinian people live a better life and i actually agree with them in that regard unfortunately i think many of them are incredibly ill informed as to the facts on the ground i think all of the people who are advocating online for the palestinian people who are who are you know going to these marches in support of them i think they'd be best served if they really care about effectuating towards the hamas leadership i think that it's very clear that the group that's responsible for the palestinian people living the lives that all of these people are angry about is hamas and if they direct their anger towards hamas and put the attention on the failings of hamas and put forth a vision for what they'd like to see leadership in gaza do and they respect that there's a real fear that israel has and any country would have of having a group of terrorists next to them that's calling for their destruction i think that that recognition of finding a way for israel to be secure and then having an opportunity for the palestinian people to live a better life is the right pathway to try and pursue so to you there's a clear distinction between hamas and the palestinian people and that hamas is the enemy of progress and the flourishing of the palestinian people hundred percent it's very very clear and i think that if people were honest about the situation if they spent the time to really understand it again you know if you follow the conference i did in bahrain we had all the leading businessmen there and they said we can rebuild gaza very easily we all want to the leading arab businessmen the leading american businessmen everyone wants to they're just held back by hamas and so i do think having an honest conversation about this at this point in time has really only one logical conclusion and my hope is that maybe this conflict leads to that conversation being had and if it is then maybe that brings more unity and understanding and we kind of get to a conclusion better that could improve the lives of the palestinian people pragmatic question about the future do you hope donald trump wins in twenty twenty four and how can his administration help bring peace to the middle east i think when donald trump was president we had a peaceful world everyone said if he was elected we would have world war three meanwhile he gets elected and he not only is the first president in decades to not start any wars he's making peace deals he's making trade deals he's working with our allies getting them to pay their fair share in nato he's you know having a dialogue with china with russia he's weakening iran and so i do think that the job he did as a foreign policy president was tremendous i think you know now more and more people are starting to recognize that again under president biden this is the second war that's broken out in the world and when you have a weak american leadership the world becomes a less safe place and so my hope and prayers are are that that that president trump is reelected and that he's able to then restore order and calm and peace and prosperity to the world from a place of strength that's the only way he knows how to do it what gives you hope about the future of this region of israel and of the middle east the middle east for twenty years was an area of conflict they spent all their money on bullets and bombs you have young leadership now in saudi arabia and uae and qatar and there's a much more ambitious agenda now for the region to make it an economic superpower and hub of the world israel is one of the most burgeoning and exciting tech economies in the world and if you think about it it's almost like having silicon valley not connected to california the thing that's held the region back for all these years has just been the conflict and the division and the lack of connectivity but if you have that region if it can all come together if you can create a security architecture you have an incredibly young population you have a lot of wealth and resources and a lot of capabilities and and and know how and so i think that if it's managed correctly and if iran is is is able to be restrained and and and suppressed with their ambitions to cause destabilization i don't mean around the country i mean the iranian regime because actually once you have this economic sphere if you could bring iraq into it if you could bring iran into it that makes it even bigger and stronger and the persian people are incredibly entrepreneurial and incredibly industrious so i do think that the region has tremendous potential it's just been held back by bad policy bad leadership bad objectives and again you know when president trump left office in you know two thousand two thousand twenty one the middle east was really on a very very positive trajectory and if the right things happen it can continue to be so so you know i'm praying at this moment in time that we navigate the current crisis that the important objectives are achieved of eliminating the terrorists and their threats and then allowing the leaders who are focused on giving their citizens and and their neighbors the opportunity to live a better life are able to work together and and and really dream and be ambitious and find ways to create a paradigm where humans can flourish what is the best way to defeat hate in the world hate is is a very powerful force and it's much easier to hate people you don't know it's funny when i was working on prison reform one of the most interesting people i met was a reverend actually down in texas who negotiated the first truce between the bloods and the crips two of the notorious gangs in america in prison i was very excited to meet him and when i met him i said well well how'd you do it and he says very simple he says i got all the guys together and i i had a tremendous amount of barbecue brought in he says and i got the meeting he says no drinking he says drinking sometimes gets people a little bit more against each other he says but i got a meeting and they started sitting down together and they started saying you know what you're just like me and all of a sudden they started finding areas where they were more together yeah look i've traveled all over the world now i've i've i've been very fortunate to meet people from different states in america i've different political persuasions different ages different classes and what i found is that there's a fundamental driving amongst all of us where we all wanna live a better life and you know people don't wanna fight naturally but it's easy to fight when you feel wronged or you feel like somebody disrespected you or somebody did something from hatred and and and hatred leads to more hatred which sometimes just pushes that cycle further and further so i believe that each and every one of us has the power to stop that cycle and we don't do it by you know being on twitter and yelling at people we don't do it by just being critical we do it by finding the people we disagree with by listening to them by asking questions by sitting with them and then if we each take responsibility to try to make the world better then i think that there's no limits to the incredible place that this world can be so as as you've said you've traveled all across the world do you think most people are good most people have love in their heart i do believe that yeah and you have some bad people i mean you have some real evil people i mean a big part of the work i did was on prison reform and you know previously the mentality was is that the prison should basically be a warehouse for human trash and if you've made a mistake in this world then you know we're gonna throw you out and we're gonna make the rest of your life incredibly difficult because you're gonna have a criminal record you're not gonna have access to jobs but what i found is when i would sit with people in prison the people i've met through my father's experience and who i met along the way is that you know people make mistakes we're all human i think it's the right thing from a religious perspective to give people second chances i always believe you shouldn't judge people by the worst mistake they make in their life unfortunately now in the era of social media people will say one wrong thing it sticks with them forever they get canceled or they get put out we're all humans we grow from our mistakes we learn from our mistakes and i think that some people are just just evil there are some evil people but i do think the vast vast vast majority of people are good and i do think that people sometimes also can be in a bad place and then society can push them to a worse and worse place but we all have the power to make them feel loved make them feel heard and and i think there's also tremendous power that we have as people to to help people get to a better place and so you know my wife and i we've always tried to be a force for good we've always tried to be you know we've always tried to provide a place where people can discuss with each other when we were in washington we would host dinners at our house all the time or we would have democrats and republicans sitting together you know you know we just had i saw senator feinstein just passed away we had a great dinner at her house when she was a senator with her and her husband and mark meadows when he was on the freedom caucus and we had actually a fascinating discussion about iran mark was much more hard line than me i had to actually bite my tongue i was impressed at how much he did whereas you know feinstein and her husband were like super into you know they knew the iranians well they thought they were peace loving and it was an incredibly robust and respectful debate and so i don't think we maybe concluded anything that night but it was interesting for people to get together having a dinner at my house where i had dick durbin you know the number two ranking democrat in the senate lindsey graham and stephen miller who's known to be a very hard line on immigration discussing what an immigration reform could look like i mean they left that dinner saying wow you know we we hadn't spoken to people on the other side and we actually agree on like eighty five percent of things like maybe something is possible and so i believe that we should always be trying to push to make the world a better place and you only do that by by listening to people and and connecting with each with people and by respecting people and finally i'll just say on this is that you know i meet people all the time who have so much confidence in their perspectives and i'm very jealous that that these people are able to be so confident about every single thing because for me i have you know some degree of confidence in the things that i've studied and what i've learned but i'm always trying to find you know people who disagree to kinda sharpen my perspectives and to help me grow and to help me learn further and so i think that's kind of the beauty of the world is that you know the knowledge base continues to grow the facts continue to change and what's possible tomorrow continues to become different and so as humans we have to continue to to thrive to to learn and to grow and to connect and if we do that everything's possible well jared thank you for your compassion first of all but also your wisdom today on this very difficult this tragic set of events these difficult days for the world it's a big honor to speak with you again every time i speak to you i learn a lot about the world and i i deeply appreciate like i said like your humility and your understanding of the details of all the complex power dynamics and human dynamics that are going on in the world once again thank you for talking today thank you and lex if i could say just one final thing which is that my thoughts and prayers are really with all of the people in israel and and the innocent civilians as well from the palestinian side and my prayers are with the idf soldiers that they should be safe and they should be really watched by god to accomplish whatever mission will enable to make the world a safer place thank you for listening to this newly recorded segment of the conversation that addresses the current situation in israel and gaza and now we go on to the second part of the conversation recorded on thursday october fifth given your experience in negotiating with some of the most powerful and influential leaders in the world what's the key to negotiating difficult agreements in geopolitics i start with a big question if i look back on the different negotiations i had when i was in government either with leaders of countries with representatives of leaders or even with members of congress to pass legislation the most important thing i would draw back to would be trust i think getting to know each other understanding what was motivating the other party to get to the outcome and making them feel like you weren't going to use whatever information they gave you to benefit yourself at the expense of them is probably what i would call table stakes to have a shot at accomplishing anything that was hard in negotiation after that i would say taking maybe a first principles approach to what the outcome of whatever problem you're looking to solve should be now you have different kinds of negotiations i always try to create a framework in the negotiation where it wasn't me against you it was always let's agree on what the outcome is that we're trying to accomplish let's all sit on the same side of the table and say we wanna get to this outcome how do we get there really trying to create a roadmap and so once you understand the destination you wanna get to the endpoint then you'd have to work backwards and really try to put yourself in their shoes and try to understand what were their motivations macro most of the time you have to assume that a leader's primary objective was to stay in power and so all decisions made would be made through the framework of what it would take to to do that and how it would impact their ability to do that and then finally i would just say that in any negotiation you have to understand the power dynamics as well and you have to then weight your approach in order to maneuver pieces to accomplish the objective and so in areas where we had stronger power dynamics i'd always look at it and say what are the potential escape routes where a politician would say this is just the reason why we can't get there and i'd always think how can you try to eliminate those escape routes or make them much harder to accomplish and then ultimately think about what's the golden bridge that you wanna create for them in order to get to the other side where they were motivated to get there because it was in their self interest to get there but also because it helped accomplish the different objective and i have many examples that that i live through with that obviously negotiating in congress for for prison reform i had to form a lot of trust with democrats whether it was hakeem jeffries or dick durbin and then also on the republican side with i had mike lee i had lindsey graham i had tim scott senator grassley and then also doug collins in the house was tremendous and you know every time we maneuvered something we would get attacked either from the left you know there's a time we were being attacked by you know nancy pelosi john lewis for not being you know inclusive enough and then there were times that we maneuvered it we'd be attacked from the right for maybe going too far and ultimately we had to find just the right place where we can get it done and the same thing happened with usmca where we were negotiating the biggest trade deal in the history of the world which was one point three trillion dollars in annual trade between mexico canada the united states of america and we were able to form good trust with the other side and try to say how do we create win win outcomes and ultimately we're able to do something in a record time that people thought was very hard to do and both of them in a divided time of the trump administration were bipartisan wins with with big big votes in the senate and the house you have a lot of stories of this kind sometimes a soft approach sometimes a hard approach like there's i think a story where with beebe there was a a potential like a dramatic election coming up and you have to say no no excuses no delaying you have to we have to make this agreement i know bb cares about israel more than the particular dynamics of the election like you have to draw a hard line there yeah but in fairness too like you know for him during the time that we were dealing with him he was always in election versus election and and then election and you know what he was saying wasn't wrong and i think he was more expressing his concerns given the dynamics and you know we never held those concerns against him we just said those are real concerns he had we respected those concerns but then we helped him prioritize to help accomplish the right things and that's ultimately what the partnership is right my job was to represent america his job was to represent israel and you had other parties representing their own interests and as long as you assume that you know people were acting mostly in good faith you were able to navigate areas where you didn't have you know complete overlap of of priorities and objectives just to go back to the trust thing you sometimes see that with leaders where they're kinda it looks like they're trying to screw over the other person when they're talking and so not having that i think is a really powerful thing for earning trust like they people actually can believe that their results driven are and are working towards a certain end is there like a skill to that like what is that genetics you're born with that or is that something like you develop so basically it requires you to look at the game of politics and not have a kind of cynicism about it to where everybody's trying to manipulate you and actually just go in with a kinda open mind and open heart and actually speak truthfully to people like on a basic human level i would say that i always would think about how can i be a partner to others like i would want somebody to be a partner to me and a lot of it comes from just my different experiences in business i've had great partners i've had terrible partners my father you know again a lot of my my childhood was i was exposed to business my father you know on sundays he would take us to to job sites and to the office with him instead of to football games like my friends you know fathers would do and so we were exposed to business and what he would say about his father who was an immigrant to america came over with nothing and no formal education but he would always say a good deal with a bad partner will always be a bad deal and a bad deal with a good partner you'll figure it out and so going through some of the challenges in that i had in my life early on whether it was the issue with with my father that we'll i'm sure we'll talk about or even going through some you know tougher financial times during the great financial crisis i really learned a lot about partnership and i always thought how can i act in a way where i could be the type of partner or friend to others that i wish others would be to me so when you look for a good partner don't you think there's the capacity for both good and bad in every person so when you talk when you negotiate with all these leaders aren't there like multiple people you're speaking to inside one person that you're trying to encourage catalyze like the goodness in the human yeah so so a lee leaders are generally chosen by their country and so my view was is if i had an objective i didn't get to choose who was the leader of other countries my job was to deal with that leader understand their strengths understand their weaknesses understand their power dynamics as well you know one of my greatest takeaways when i grew up i'd read the newspapers about all these powerful famous people and then as i got older and had the chance to meet them and do business with them and then ultimately you know interact with them in government is i realized that they're just like you and me they wake up every morning you know their kids are pissed at them their wife doesn't wanna talk with them you know and they've got you know a set of advisers around them one saying you know let's go to war one saying let's make peace one saying do the deal one saying don't do the deal and they're all thinking where do i get advice how do i make decisions and so understanding the true human nature of them and then the different power dynamics around them i thought was very key and so i didn't have a choice do i deal with them or not it was a function of how do you deal with them effectively in order to find areas where you have common interests and then work well together to pursue those common interests in order to achieve a certain goal you first of all you're incredibly well read i've gotten to know you and i've gotten to know ivanka and the the book recommendation list is just incredible so first of all thank you for that you told me about the guns of august by barbara tuckman it's a it's a book on world war one and i went down a whole rabbit hole there she's like an incredible historian but anyway the there's a bunch of stuff you learned from that but one of the things you told me is it influenced your general approach to diplomacy of just picking up the phone and giving it a try so as opposed to planning and strategizing just pick up the phone yeah so so this was a book i read way before the notion of serving in government was ever even on my mind or or reality and i remember thinking about it reading it and thinking how world war one started where you had you know somebody was assassinated and then you had all these different alliances that were created and then in order to accomplish objectives it triggered all of these people getting in bed with everyone else because of documents that were created without the intent of going to a massive war and i think in the course of world war one it was one of the greatest atrocities that we've seen as humanity we've had sixteen million people killed in that war and i was i was reading the book i remember thinking to myself even though you know things are set in a certain way go sit with somebody go talk to them and say this doesn't make sense this is wrong how do we create a better pathway mhmm and as a civilian all my life you know i would read the newspapers i would i would i would you know observe how different leaders would act but when we had the opportunity to serve in government and have the position you realize you're not a civilian you don't have the luxury of sitting back and letting the world happen the way it's happening you have agency and you have the potential to influence the outcome of things and one thing i've seen is you know most political prognosticators are wrong anyone who tells you what's going to happen really has no clue and it's not because they're bad or they're not intelligent it's because nobody knows and at the end of the day the outcomes in the world are usually driven by the decisions of of humans and if you're able to come together form relationships listen to each other you can do that and one of the great examples that i speak about in the book is with north korea whereas if you remember in two thousand seventeen it was very intense when president obama was leaving office he told president trump that the single biggest fear that he had and this is a time when the world was a mess you had the middle east was on fire isis was beheading journalists and killing christians they had to caliphate the size of ohio libya was destabilized yemen was destabilized syria was in a civil war where five hundred thousand people were killed iran was on a glide path to a nuclear weapon yet the single biggest fear he had was north korea then it got compounded by the fact that we get into office and president trump brings his generals around and he's you know learning how to interact with all the generals and says okay what are my options and they said calm down we're we've been using all of our ammunition in the middle east we don't have enough ammunition to go to war over there and he says let's not let's not let that be too public let's try to restock and come up with a plan yeah and at the time there was a lot of banter back and forth and you know i was able to i got a call from a friend who was a a an old business contact who actually had done business in north korea and he said you know i'd love to find a way to solve this and i was getting calls from friends at the time saying i'm trying to go to hawaii for vacation should i not be going is it not safe i mean we forget we forget the psychology yeah of how intense that was at the time and then through that interaction he called some of his contacts in north korea and then we were able with the cia to open up a back channel that ultimately led to the the de escalation the meeting between trump and kim jong un which led to a de escalation so that was really the mindset which was whenever there's a problem just pick up the phone and try and i think president trump had a very similar approach which was let's let's give it a shot and he wasn't afraid to go after the hard ones too and i'll say one final thing on this which is that in politics the incentive structure is just much different than in the real world right in the sense that you have a hard problem then if you try to solve a hard problem the likelihood of failure is great whereas in the business world if you're going after a hard problem we celebrate those people right we we we want our entrepreneurs and our great people to go after solving the big hard problems but in politics if you try to take on a hard problem you have a high likelihood of failure you'll get a lot of criticism on your pathway to trying to accomplish that if you fail and then if you fail it has a higher probability of leading to you losing your opportunity to serve and so it's just one of these things where people wanna play it safe which is not the notion that that that really was taken during the time that president trump was in office do you think it has to be that way i think i think there's something in in the human spirit like in the public that desires politicians to take big take on the big bold problems right like why why is it the politician need to be so afraid of failure i don't think it has to be that way and that's i think one of the great lessons from the time in of the the trump administration he brought a lot of people from the business world into government the business people have a much different mindset than government people and there was a lot of resistance and i think part of why there was so much resistance was because you know i think about it from my personal sense was that if i was successful with no traditional qualifications to do diplomacy it meant that all the people with traditional qualifications and diplomacy didn't necessarily need those qualifications in order to be successful and that same that same sentiment manifested itself in many areas in government and and i think that in the business world it's it's outcome oriented it's results oriented and you know what we would see in in new york is there they would stab you in the eye in dc they would stab you in the back and it just became a whole different dynamic of of of how you work through these different areas so the answer is it it doesn't have to be that way you just need the right courageous leader and that's why i'm so optimistic about what the future of america and the world could be if you have the right people in power who are willing to take on the right challenges and do it in the right way so if we if we just linger on the north korea and the de escalation and the meeting what's the trajectory from this could be the most catastrophic thing that destroys the world to you find back channels you start talking and start arranging the meeting like is there some insights you can give to how difficult that is to do in that in in the north korea case which seems like to be one of the more closed off parts of the world and any other cases that you worked on yeah it's it's always very challenging and especially when you're going against the grain of what's established right we did something different to think that an old business contact that i had sure could then do it i mean that's the type of thing that you know if the press knew what we were doing they would have you know derided it and criticized it in every which way mhmm but that was one of the benefits of operating very much below the radar is that we were able to try all these different things and not all of them worked but some of them did and you know but that is what's amazing about the world right this could be the biggest story on the front page of every paper and they're inciting fear in everyone and it's not illegitimate fear i mean there were missile tests you know over over japan i mean you had a lot of very big challenges with that file and then all of a sudden we make contact we go through negotiations to set a meeting there's a meeting between president trump and kim jong un then all of a sudden there's there's a framework to try and move things forward and again i think that there's a lot of possibility there for what could happen if it's worked in the right way i just wanna know like how you word that first email or text message like what emojis to use like the hugging emoji i mean it's just personally i've gotten to know a lot of powerful and rich people and just it's funny that they're all human just like you're saying and like a lot of the drama a lot of the problems can be resolved with just like a little camaraderie a little kindness a little like just actually just reaching out we're all human beings and and people wanna be successful and people wanna be good and and you're right too there's there's way more emojis involved in diplomacy than i ever would have expected but and every leader i'm sure has their favorite emoji this is also i learned about people that use like they there's there's everybody has their go to emoji like i usually go to the heart very quickly yeah emoji there's some people who go the hugging whatever that where you're like doing the hugging thing anyway this conversation quickly turned to the ridiculous but to do another book reference you mentioned the book thirteen days in september by lawrence wright in discussing all the work you've done in in israel and the middle east i just wanna ask you sort of the interesting aspect of that book which is the influence of the personalities and personal relationships on these negotiations you kinda started to allude to that with the trust but how much do the personalities matter in this so going from north korea to the middle east here to within congress and all that kind of stuff yeah completely in every way i mean that that that's an incredible book and it's a very entertaining read it has obviously a lot of good historical context on some of the key players whether it was anwar sadat or menachem begin or jimmy carter and and and cy vance and and a lot of the others who were involved with those negotiations and the the thing that i kind of took from that experience was just how personal it was and and again one of my favorite stories from that book was how anwar sadat who was a big big leader he had a a mystic who was according to this book again history i i i like reading it but i always you know realize that you have to notice that this is just the perspective of a given author that's writing it but the way that they write this book was that he had an adviser who was a mystic and the mystic was having a back channel with the israelis and the mystic told sadat if you go to israel and you make a speech at the knesset bacon is ready to give you the sinai and so he goes to israel they set this whole thing up he goes and gives the knesset they go for their meeting after and sadat says okay well are we gonna do this thing and bacon says what are you talking about i'm not giving you an inch of our land and it was just one of these things where it was a miscommunication that brought about the symbolic visit of anwar sadat to israel and that was one of these notions that just made everyone think that something was possible that they thought was impossible a moment before actually we had an example like that during our time in government when we did the abraham accords the first step of the accords was really a phone call between president trump prime minister netanyahu and mohammed bin zayed who at that point was the crown prince and and de facto ruler of the uae but all we had was a a phone call and then a statement that was released and what was interesting after that is we said okay well how do we integrate countries nobody's done this in a long time and we were trying to figure out all the issues and there's big miscommunications between israel and uae and we were navigating through all the issues and so after a couple weeks i said you know what i've gotta go over there and try to sort through these issues so we make a plan to go to israel then we can go to uae and then a a young gentleman who worked with me named avi berkowitz says well if we're flying from israel to uae instead of flying on a government plane why don't we see if we can get an el al plane and we'll do the first official commercial flight and so i said that's a great idea let's call you know ambassador otaiba yousef who was the first official commercial flight and so i said that's a great idea let's call you know ambassador otaiba yousef who is the first official commercial flight and so said that's a great idea let's call you know ambassador altaiba yousef who was a tremendous player in the abraham accords working behind the scenes you know day and night and was really a big a big catalyst so he calls yousef and he said sure no problem let's give it a shot so so we go and we do it and he says if we can work at these issues what we'll do so we go to israel we do our meetings we get everything back into a good place we set up this this this trip over we fly in an el al plane we fill it up at the time it was during covid with a health delegation we had the financial ministry because we had to open up you know banking relationships so they could wire money between countries we want to get you know health partnerships then we just had a lot of legal things and national security things we want to start putting together so we do this flight and we end up landing in uae and the picture of us coming off the plane being greeted by you know emirates and tobes with a el al plane with an israeli flag on it just captured everyone's imagination and so it was one of these things where it's like you work so hard on the details and the negotiation i mean hundreds of hours to to kinda make sure everything's perfect and the one thing that you do kind of you know yeah let's give it a shot that image ended up capturing everyone's heart so going back to sadat that visit was very critical and what was interesting was is according to this book it happened because of a miscommunication mhmm that was the first part the second part of the book that's just amazing theater and actually the book was based on a play it was just going back and forth with all of the the different methodologies that they tried that failed but they kept trying at it and then ultimately seeing how the personalities were able to find ways to make the compromise that ultimately was a very very big thing for more stability in the middle east and so amazing book i would highly recommend it a very entertaining read and and something that at least gave me encouragement to to keep going when the task i was pursuing seemed so so so large i mean if you could just linger on the personalities you you write in the book that words matter or you you write in the context of saying in the diplomacy business words matter and then you said that we're in the results business it's a badass line but but if we just stick to the diplomacy business and words mattering it seems like and one of the things you really highlight that individual words can really have like you can fight over individual words so like how do you operate in a world where like single words matter i think you have to be respectful to the craft that you're in where words matter but then realize that they don't matter as much and then also focus on the fact that you know the actions are actually what's gonna matter more than the words and so you have a difference between leaders and politicians you know politicians are there to say the right thing and to hold the power leaders are people who are willing to do things that will be transformational from my perspective and so when i would think about diplomacy words without actions or without the threat of actions and that was something that president trump did very well was that people knew that he was willing to take action he was very unpredictable in how he would act and that made our words much more effective in what they did so it's all a combination but you know coming from the private sector we are all about results right if you're in government you can work on something for ten years and fail and then retire and they consider you an expert in the private sector if you work on something for ten weeks and you don't have a success then you're unemployed you know so it's it's it's a different kind of notion and and it was just understanding the mentality and trying to adjust and and bridging the divides between the different trainings is that the biggest thing you took from your business background is that just be really results focused it was just the only way to be i mean if i was giving up you know a nice life in new york and if i was giving up you know the the stuff that i really enjoyed the company that i'd i'd helped build and you know the the the the life that i was enjoying in order to do government i was going there to make a difference and you know we had to focus on it the other skill set so there was a couple skill sets that i found were quite deficient in government first of all there was a ton of amazing people i mean people talk about the bureaucracy what i found was is you had incredibly committed passionate intelligent capable people all throughout the government and what they were waiting for though was direction and then cover in order to get there and so there were a lot of tasks that i worked on whether it was you know building the wall at the southern border where i was able to work with you know customs border patrol you know army corps of engineers military dhs professionals dod and we basically all came together and then once we had a good project management plan we were able to kinda move very very quickly i think we built about four hundred and seventy miles of border barrier in about two years basically and that was very that worked very well because we basically brought private sector project management skill sets which which were quite often missing in government the second one is just you know we spoke about negotiation earlier i would say that most people in government it's just a different form of negotiation than you see in the private sector and way less effective in that regard which is why i think it's good the more we can encourage more people with private sector experience to do a stint in government and to really try to contribute and serve their country that's how our founders i mean george washington and all the the the founding fathers they they're working on their farms they they left their farms serving government then they went back to the farm and that was kind of the design of you you know the representative government it wasn't a career political class it was you know people coming in to you know show gratitude for the freedoms and the liberties that they enjoyed and then you know you know do their best to kind of you know help others have those same opportunities that they had and then they'd go back and live their lives and so so i think that there's a lot of opportunity with our government of people with more business mindsets who are gonna think about things from a solutions perspective go and serve is that one of the main problems here so you you also mentioned the book the great degeneration by neil ferguson an awesome historian he's been on this podcast it helped you understand the inefficiencies of government regulation i'd love it if you can give an insight into why government is so inefficient at times like when it is inefficient when it doesn't work why is that the case the bureaucracy that you spoke to the negative aspects of the bureaucracy so we don't have enough time on this podcast to go into it but it's look there's there's a lot of aspects that work as well right but i do think we've gotten too big you know neil's book that you mentioned you know one of the things that i took from that i read it i think in in two thousand twelve right kind of in the middle of the great financial crisis was he was talking about how government regulation often was put in place to deal with old crises right so it was never gonna solve future problems it was more to kind of create to solve for problems that had happened in the past and i remember thinking about that one thing i was very proud of of the work of the trump administration was that you had four years consecutively where there is a net decrease in the cost of regulations so to give you a context in the last year of obama in two thousand sixteen there were six million man hours spent by the private sector complying with new federal regulations and that's not really what the intent of our government was right if we have rules or regulations those should be legislated by congress they shouldn't be put in by you know by bureaucrats who are basically saying i wanna follow this objective so using kind of the power of the pen in order to do that so the deregulatory effort was actually very critical to trump's economic success that happened at the beginning of the administration and then what i saw with regulation was anytime either there was legislation or regulation coming the people pushing for it were usually the people who would benefit from the regulatory captures you had these know you look at you know the great financial crisis where you had these big banking reforms well what happened during the big banking reforms then you had a big reduction in the amount of banks that occurred and the big banks became even bigger whereas i don't think that was the intention of the legislation but the people who were writing the legislation and influencing it had a lot of the constituencies from those larger institutions and then what happened as a result of that a lot of these smaller institutions didn't have the ability to be as competitive they had more restrictions more costs they became less profitable but these were the banks that were serving small business which is the biggest creator of jobs in our country and then as a result the bigger banks got more powerful and what happened in the country as a result of the the regulations that they put in place the wealth gap in the country grew it didn't shrink and so i think oftentimes what they say these regulations are intended to be the result often becomes the opposite and so you know what what president trump did in his administration was they did a massive deregulatory effort and i think they pledged that for every one regulation they put on because you do need some regulation in an economy and in a society they would take off too and in the first year they eliminated eight regulations for everyone and so so that was just something i took from it which which was i thought very interesting and you had to really i i think you just have to think through what are the consequences gonna be of the different actions you take and often government gets it wrong by taking an action that feels right but has big negative consequences down the road let's go to some difficult topics you wrote in the book about your experience with some very low points in government you've been attacked quite a bit one of the ones that stands out is the accusations of collusion with russia and you tell in the book in general this whole story this whole journey on a personal level on a sort of big political level can you tell me some aspects of this story sure so to give the listeners some context and people remember this now it's been kinda swept away because it turned out not to be true was that after president trump won the election in two thousand sixteen instead of the media saying we were wrong because again everyone thought he had zero chance of of winning they said okay well we couldn't have been wrong it must have been the russians who worked with him and so at first when this started coming up i thought this was ridiculous i mean i i was very intimately involved with the operations of the campaign i was running the finance of the campaign i was running the digital media of the campaign i was running the the the the the the schedule for the campaign and i knew that on most days we had trouble like you know working coordinating with ourselves you know let alone you know you know collaborating with another government and colluding as they called it and so we did a great job i think as an underdog campaign very leanly staffed and then they said that you know we were working with the russians and so at the time i didn't take it too seriously because i knew there was no truth to it but it was amazing to me to start seeing all of these institutions whether it was cnn the washington post new york times these were news organizations that i grew up having a lot of respect for taking these accusations so seriously and then working themselves up in order to in order to just cover it for two years and then as a result you had a special counsel you had a a house investigation a senate investigation and i personally spent about i think over twenty hours just you know testifying before these different committees again spent millions of dollars of out of my own pocket on my legal fees to make sure i was well represented and the reason i did that was because i saw in washington it was like a sick game right it's almost like you know even though there was no underlying problems to the accusation i felt like this is one of those things where they're gonna try to catch you and then if you step on the line they catch you with one misrepresentation they're gonna try to put you in jail or worst of you know it it it and so for me that was a big concern so you you know it was amazing i mean my my my poor mom you know i told her to stop you know reading whatever i said i promise you we didn't do anything wrong it's good but you know she'd call me and say well you know our friends were you know on the upper east side we're talking with chuck schumer he says jared's going to jail you know we we know for sure that he colluded with the russians and this is like a leading senator saying things like this and so it was just interesting for me to see how the whole world could believe something and be talking about it that i knew with one thousand percent certainty was just not true and so seeing that play out was very very hard obviously you know i was accused of a lot of things there were times in washington i was radioactive i remember one weekend you know it was all over cnn you know the people the panels on cnn like the news organization that i grew up thinking was like the number one trusted name for news in the world talking about how i committed treason because i met with an ambassador and said we'd like to hear your perspective on what you think the policy should be in syria where there was a big civil war happening and and and isis and a lot of different things so it was quite a crazy time in that regard but luckily again we we were able to fight through it it was a major distraction for our administration and i think we were able to kinda stay focused on the objectives and the policies but it was a crazy time and i i learned a lot from that experience it's crazy how just an accusation can be viral and can just go one of the things that worries me is the effect on your mind the psychology of it to make sure it doesn't make you cynical like people that are trying to do stuff those kinds of stories that can destroy their mind so one of the things i'd love to sort of understand you kind of rolled in from the business for and all of a sudden the the entire world from cnn to everybody is accusing you of colluding with the russians like what do you like when you're sitting at home how do you keep a calm mind a clear mind a optimistic one that doesn't become cynical and actually just keep trying to push on and do stuff in the world yeah so it was a surreal experience i would say number one is i i felt very confident that i hadn't done anything wrong so you know i'd always tell my lawyer like you know the good news is i've got a good good fact problem right like i need a good lawyer to get me through it but it's it's much easier to be a good lawyer if you have a very innocent client and so you know the fact that i knew that i didn't have i i didn't believe that i had any legal liability helped me kind of intellectually separate the challenge i needed to do to fight through it from it and then i just basically said like you know i'd had hardship earlier in my life where i dealt with the situation with my father and what i realized there is that you can't really spend energy on the things that you don't control all you can do is spend your time and energy worrying about what you can control and then how you react to the things that you have there and so it took a lot of a lot of discipline it took a lot of strength and again i give my wife ivanka and even donald a lot of credit for you know for kinda having my back during that time and and and you know encouraging me just to kinda fight through it and then i also had to make sure that i didn't allow that to distract me from my job i felt like i had an amazing opportunity in the white house to to make a difference in the world and if i would have spent all my time playing defense you know in politics it's a time duration game in business you have whatever duration you set for yourself in politics it's time duration we had four years every day was sand through an hourglass my mindset was i need to accomplish as much as i can in these four years and i guess the traditional game that's played in washington is whether it's the media the opposition their job is to distract you and then try to stop you from being as successful as you wanna be and so just fought through it and wasn't always fun but we we got through and and thank god it's it's something people don't talk about and it it has been amazing to me just the lack of self awareness and and reflection of a lot of the people who hyped this up for for two years they don't think there was anything wrong with it and and that's interesting but you know my view is we got through it it's good so it's in the past and then i started moving to the future and that's really where i spent my time but i wanna linger on it because to me that has a really discouraging effect on anyone who's trying to do positive in the world like these kinds of attacks are intense yeah i mean you you say kinda one of the lessons you learned is that you really have to be perfect but i hate that to be the lesson like i feel like you should be able to do stupid stuff take big risks and like people celebrate the big risks and not try to weave gigantic stories of over nothing i just wanna kinda understand the two aspects of this how to not have such stories of so much legs and the other is how to stay psychologically strong so you kind of waved it off that you didn't have a fact problem but it can just have a a effect in your psyche yeah you seem to be pretty stoked about the whole thing but like how i mean i just on the psychology side how did you stay calm and not become cynical where you can continue to do stuff and take big risks i didn't have a choice what do you mean i mean i could have spent every day feeling sorry for myself for complaining or saying things aren't fair but the the general way i looked at it was that in life every opportunity has a cost and you know you could look at it and say maybe this was a massive cost either in in dollars or in time or in reputation or in or in or in an emotional drain but you could also say that you know i had an opportunity to work in the white house and i had an opportunity to work on some of the hardest challenges and you talk about how that's not celebrated that is something very different in the private sector sector when you take on big challenges that is celebrated in government when you take on big challenges people wanna see it fail or they wanna criticize the people who are trying to take that on and i think that's wrong and i think that you know as a country we should be thinking big we should be dreaming big and we should be encouraging our politicians to try and to fail more and to you know to to go and to to take on big things knowing that there's risk of failing obviously we want them to succeed not to fail but but let's take on the big things let's try to do that so i think it's just very basic that you know you're in a situation i've made decisions i can't go back and change decisions in the past i still felt you know very blessed to be in the position i was in and i knew that i just had to work through it and like i said i was very lucky to have you know support from my wife and from my family and from good friends again i i think i'd i'd chosen very good friends in life and my friends were with me i had one friend who who you know my lowest moment you know got on the plane he lived in arizona got on a plane and came just to have dinner with me to say just just pick your head up i know you're down now you're gonna be fine just just fight through that meant a lot to me and again i i always think in my life you know you don't learn as much from your successes you don't learn as much from your high points you learn the most about who you wanna be and how the world works from your lowest moments and at those lowest moments it just it made me better and it it taught me how to be a better friend to people who are in tough situations and i tried to just get get tougher and i tried to just get better and work through it yeah you said that you and ivanka it this this this intense time brought you two together and helped you kind of deal with the intensity of the chaos of it all so i think it was just number one knowing that you had a partner and knowing that you had somebody who who loved you and believed in you i think that was definitely by far the biggest of anything and love is the answer love is very important but then there's also a lot that i've learned from her always you know getting me to to read different books or or learn different things which i love but she's also i think an amazing role model and i i go through our time in washington where there were so many people who were i thought very nasty to her unfoundedly and i'm not talking about individually because again you know most people interacted with her were super kind but i would see people you know on twitter or different places go after and she always stayed elegant and i i felt like that was something that she never stooped down to a lower level she kept her elegance the whole time and she really went to washington wanting to be a force of good and i i see all the time that she she follows her heart she does what's right and she has a very strong moral compass and and i i feel very lucky to have her as a partner and i i respect her tremendously yeah she walks to the fire with grace i would say and she's recommended a bunch of amazing books to me and she's she has an an incredible a fascinating mind so but one thing that jumped out to me is you both love diners jersey diners so i i lived in philly for a while and i've you know i i traveled quite a bit in traveling from boston down to philly maybe to dc mhmm you can drive through jersey there's something about jersey i don't know what it is it's the best you listen to bruce springsteen there's a louis ck has this bit where i think it's part of criticizing cell phones today where people are too much on their phone they don't just sit there be bored but he's uses that story to tell where he's just driving and bruce springsteen's song comes on and he just wants to pull over to the side of the road and just like weep for no unexplainable reason and i think that's true because life is difficult life is full of suffering or struggle or challenges so there's some sometimes it's always bruce springsteen but like some kind of song like this can really make you reflect on life that melancholy feeling but that melancholy feeling is the other side of the happiness coin where if you just allow yourself to feel that pain you can also feel the highest joys mhmm that's the sort of the point lucy kane makes and there's something about jersey with the diners often late at night now there's several diner experiences i should say okay there's like the family friendly there's a nice waitress and there's a sweetness of kindness like hello sweetheart mhmm that kind of thing there's also like the three am diner where you're like the ones that are open twenty four hours mhmm that has a romantic element when you're a young man or young woman you're like traveling the loneliness of that it's just all of it mhmm the american diner is like from like jack kerouac on represents something i'm not sure what that is but it's like a real beautiful experience and the food itself too always fresh yeah the the thing with diners there's so much to love about it but i grew up obviously in new jersey when i'd go you know with my father to to business he'd always stop we'd meet at a diner late night i'd be coming back with my friends we'd stop at a diner and it's a tradition that ivanka and i love doing as well and i think there's there's a notion of it's very egalitarian and that you know people from all places are there you could order basically whatever you want i mean the the the menus at the diners look like the phone book that's great and it's amazing how they keep you know so much fresh ingredients to do it at least the good ones do i'd love as a jersey guy to get mozzarella sticks and and an omelette you know at any hour of the day because most of them are open twenty four hours and that's basically by by ivanka my go to we'll throw in a milkshake or two as well nice but for for me as a kid you know my father would take me sometimes i'd sit with him in the meeting sometimes i'd be at the table next to him he'd give me a bunch of quarters to put in the the music machine that they would have on the the wall and it was always just a great experience doing it in jersey and i joke that you know if you grow up in jersey you grow up with just just enough of a chip on your shoulder that you have to go and make something of yourself in life it's a it's a special place i had an amazing childhood there and very very proud to be from the state and i i will just give a little bit of a plug now because the state has now actually turned the corner and and they had a ten billion dollar budget surplus for many years you know it's a state that was basically bankrupt and and now actually under a pretty progressive democrat governor phil murphy he's turned the state around and it's actually has a very bright future ahead and it's it's probably one of the best places to raise a family in the country right it's got very low crime one of the best public school systems in the country pretty good health care system a lot of green parks people know the turnpike but it's got a lot to it that's really great so i'm a big big fan of jersey you know i like how this is a first for this particular podcast you literally gave a plug to a state so new jersey everybody it's where it's it's where it's at there's south jerseys north jersey i mean there's all there's all kinds of jerseys too i mean the whole thing it it just i and don't get me started on the jersey shore lex that's jersey shore is the whole thing and i'm not talking about the snooki part i'm talking about the real nice parts where you get great food great people what do you mean nice parts it's all beautiful the full range of human characters that are in new jersey are all beautiful i agree with that and every time i travel across the world there's always a meet somebody from new jersey and you kinda give a nod of under a deep understanding it's the cradle of civilization in many ways okay so back i don't know how we got there oh alright going back to the the low points you mentioned your father if we could just return there even just the personal story of your father of that you write about that or the betrayal that happened in his life and then with how he responds to that betrayal and he was con after that arrested can you just tell the story sure so my father is an amazing person and we grew up in new jersey my father was a big developer a great entrepreneur built an amazing business he got into a dispute with two of his siblings and through that dispute they basically took all of the documents in his company went to the us attorney's office and and you know turned into from a a civil dispute into a real public dispute my father did something you know wrong in that process and you know when he got arrested for that he basically said you know what what i did was wrong and he he took his medicine and he he did it like a man and he said i'm gonna go to prison and and he did that for a year and so for me that was a very challenging time in the family obviously you know i it was a shock it it it was a total change i mean i grew up my my childhood was i think a very nice childhood you know my parents always said you know do good in school work hard you know i was very very focused on my athletics i was captain of the basketball team i was captain of the hockey team you know i ran a marathon with my father and it was always about pursuing went to harvard graduated with honors and i was in nyu pursuing a law degree and a business degree and i was working at the manhattan district attorney's office at the time actually thinking i wanted to go into public service because my father always taught us we were always surrounded by politicians and he always said you know my parents came to america they lived in the land of opportunity and they had these opportunities because this is the best country in the world and so you should know be successful work hard don't ever let your opportunities become your disadvantages because you have advantages in life you have to work harder and that's what he instilled in myself and my brother and he always pushed us to make the most of ourselves and when we did that you know everything changed overnight when my father got arrested obviously it's very embarrassing for a family when you're on the front page of the papers i would see the newspapers writing all these things about my father that i didn't think were representative of the person that i knew it was a big change for our family and you know i was angry i was angry i said you know i could be angry at at the prosecutor i could be angry at my father's brother i could be angry at my father's lawyers i could be angry at my father for for making this mistake and then i kinda said that's not gonna change anything and i had a real shift and i i do think that that was a turning point in my life where i basically said let me focus on the things i can control let me focus on the positive things i can do and from that moment forward i said how can i be a great son to my father how could i be a great older brother slash you know substitute father for my my two sisters my younger brother how could i be there for my mother how could i be there for my father's business and i just went into to to battle mode and i put my eye my my my i put my armor on and i just you know ran into it and for the next two years it was every day was painful i mean i was dealing with banks i was dealing the company was still at subpoenas i was still in law school i i did tell my father i want to drop out of law school and business school but he said please don't so i would basically go to law school one day a week or maybe i'd skip it most days and i'd go to his office every day and my friends would joke that if my professors wanted to fail me the the the law professor would have to give me a test that had four pictures and say circle who your professor is you know but i would basically take a week off i'd read the books and i did well and i got my degrees and it was just a very very challenging time but like i said to you before is that you learn the most about life and you learn the most about humanity and yourself when you're in your most challenging periods and i'll say that you know that experience also changed you know the people i interacted with spending weekends with my father down in in a prison in alabama i met the other inmates i met their families i spent time then trying to advise the children of other people who were going through the same experience that i'd gone through on how to navigate it you know correctly and you just learn a lot about the world and you see that you know in life everything could get taken from you your status your money your friends i saw that certain people were very disloyal to my father at the time who he thought were friends it was only a handful but again i learned from those people how can i be a true friend to people how can i be better and i i learned a tremendous amount through that experience you're right that your father told you about being humble that i'd love to ask you about this that in life sometimes it gets so powerful that we start to think we're the dealers of our own fate we're not the dealers god is the dealer sometimes we have to be brought back down to earth to get perspective on what is really important what do you think he meant by that what did what did you learn from that experience what what the way i interpret it at the time and those were very very memorable words and it occurred i was down after i picked up my father from the arraignment i drove him down i drove the car and my father and i are very very close and he didn't say a word for the whole time and i think he was processing number one what was happening to him and i i couldn't even imagine but i actually think the bigger pain for him because my father is such a committed person to the family is like did i let my family down did i let my kids down and i do think he felt at that moment like his life was over he couldn't really see past what this challenge was gonna bring and if there would be a life for him after it so i i could see that he had a lot of fear and he really wasn't saying much and then i didn't know what to do and so i just stood by him and stood close and you know later that that that day or the next day he got up and started walking he had an ankle monitor for whatever reason the prosecutor was such a so aggressive he was a flight risk so they made him wear an ankle monitor they were very very aggressive and nasty and at the time my father was the biggest donor to democrats the prosecutor was a republican it was a very political thing and and what happened was is he was walking around the pool and i just started walking with him and he said to me you know jared in life sometimes we get so powerful that we believe that we're the dealer he says but we're not the dealer god's the dealer and we have to you know come down to earth to understand like you said so what what i took from that was that my father with all of his success had started to believe that that maybe certain rules didn't apply to him and i think that that's where he made a mistake and i think he had a lot of regret that he made the mistake and you know my father is a very humble person he's a very moral person you know for me with my humility my my brother and i joke that we give our credit for being humble number one to being mets fans because every year you have a lot of promise and then it never ends up paying off although now with steve cohen hopefully we're on a different trajectory but the other thing is also our mother you know our mother really raised us to be very humble to be you know we had we knew we had a lot but every sunday morning my mom was there clipping the coupons the cereal we ate in our house was based on you know was based on what was on sale versus what we liked you know when we would have a problem with our teachers in school and i'd say well teacher doesn't like me she'd say well i'm not calling them it's your job to make the teacher like you and so my mother gave us a lot of that my father gave us a lot of the grounding and i think during that time my father was just realizing that maybe he had gotten disconnected from the the grounding and the values and and again i think he also accepted maybe he could have you know blamed others for acting inappropriately but i respect the fact that he took responsibility himself and said i can't control the actions of other people i can't control what they do is right and wrong i can just control my actions and as i go on the next journeys in my life and i i go to government i go to washington i mean i i even think through the the craziness of going from you know visiting my father in a prison to ten years later sitting in the office in the white house next to the president of the united states and like i think about that story and that it's it's a story that only god could write and i i really believe that you have to have a lot of faith because the lows and the highs are both so extreme and unbelievable that i feel like those low moments in some ways allowed me to keep my grounding and to understand what what was truly important in life for when i ended up going through those other moments your father was betrayed perhaps over money by siblings is there some deeper wisdom you can draw from that have you have you seen money or perhaps power cloud people's judgment oh hundred hundred percent hundred percent is there some kinda optimistic thing you can take from that about human nature of how to escape that clouding of judgment when you're talking about leaders when you're talking about government even business because you mentioned there's a power dynamics at play always when you're negotiating mhmm is there a way to see the common humanity and not see the sort of will to power in the whole thing definitely you know you mentioned about power money corrupting there's a great quote i heard a friend of mine say it's a guy michael harris who was one of the founders of death row records and you know he was being interviewed recently and they asked him about what happened with shook knight and his line was you know money just makes you more of what you already are which i thought was a very elegant way of saying it and i i would see this time and time again in the white house where you had people who were now given a lot of maybe didn't act in a way that i thought was always conducive to the objective so i think it's a very big problem that you have whether it's it's something that's solvable i think it's about having the right leaders and and hopefully for the leaders having good friends i mean i'm still friends with a lot of the people i interacted with when i was in government and you know the number one thing i try to be to to them is just a good friend i try to be somebody who they can talk about things with i don't go in trying to tell them what to do on different things or you know or or and i think that that's a big thing is that people just need friends and they need conversation and if they have that then hopefully that allows them to keep their head in the right place i think this is a good place to ask about one aspect of the fascinating work you've done which is on prison reform can you take me through your journey of helping the the bipartisan bill get passed just working on prison reform in the white house in general how you made that happen how you help make that happen sure so we passed a a a law called the first step act which was the largest prison and criminal justice reform bill that's been done maybe in thirty forty fifty years in the us and so what it basically did was two things number one is it took the prison system and it took a certain class of offenders and allowed them to become eligible for earlier release if they go through the certain trainings that will allow them to have a lower probability of going back so you know stepping back you look at the prison system you say what's the purpose is it to punish is it to warehouse is it to rehabilitate and i do think that you know we're a country that believes in second chances i saw firsthand when my father was a client of the system how inefficient it was and how much better it could be and you know when my father got out we didn't run from that experience he started hiring people from rikers island and and you know different prisons into the company into a second chance program which we're very very proud of doing and what we saw through our micro experience was that if you give people mentorship if you give them job training a lot of people you know leave they have addiction issues and they can't find housing and so you know people leave prison with a criminal record and they're less likely to go back and reintegrate in society without help from from from different institutions that can help them do that so we modeled the reforms of what they did in texas and georgia and other states where they basically put a lot of job training alcohol and addiction treatment programs in the prisons as a way to incentivize the prisoners to work on themselves while they're there in order to allow them to reenter society it's turned out to be very successful so far they just had a report that showed that the general population has had a forty seven percent recidivism rate meaning that people who leave federal prison half of them go back and people who have now taken this program only twelve percent of them go back so number one you're making communities safer because if people are gonna now get a job and enter society instead of committing future crimes you're avoiding future crimes and number two you're giving people a second chance at life and so that was the first part of it the second thing we did was there was a rule passed in the nineties that basically penalized crack cocaine at hundred times the penalty of what regular cocaine was and i think a lot of the motivations what people say in retrospect was that crack was more of a black drug drug and cocaine was more of a white drug and so there was a really racial disparity in terms of what the application of these sentences were so they they then revised that to make it eighteen to one and what we did in this bill is we allowed it to go retroactive to allow people who were in prison with sentences under the what we thought was the racist law to be able to make an application to a judge in order to be and it was based on good behavior you know being rehabilitated and the fact that they would have a low probability of offending in the future and and so that was really the meat of it and there was a couple other things in there we did as well which were also quite good so we did it worked very closely with the democrats republicans to do it at first president trump was a little bit skeptical of it because he's a big strong law and order supporter but he made me work very hard to put together a coalition of republicans and democrats and law enforcement we had the support from from the the the the policemen we had the support from the aclu and ultimately we were able to get it together and it was an amazing thing we ended up getting eighty seven votes in the senate you know this was happened for me at a time it was while the russia investigation stuff was still happening new chief of staff came in john kelly he basically marginalized me and the operations so i had kind of less day to day responsibilities in the white house and so for me this effort became one of my full time efforts along with negotiating the mexico trade deal and along with the middle east efforts and the reason why that was great was because it didn't have a lot of support from the republican caucus originally and people thought there was no way it would happen so i really was able to be the chief executive the middle executive the low executive the intern and through that process i really got an education on how congress works on how to pass legislation i was negotiating text i was negotiating back and forth and i built a lot of trust again i deal with whether it's hakim jeffries or cedric richmond we built a lot of trust we'd speak three times a day these guys had my back the the aclu again i never thought they were suing the because there was a lot a big part of the conservative base that felt like we should be giving people a second chance and in addition to that this will keep our country safer and it will reduce the cost of what we spend on prisons and so it was a great effort and i was very very proud that we're able to get it done under president trump how'd you con convince the republicans so they were skeptical at first are we talking about like just phone conversations going out to lunch just the back to the emojis or what hand to hand combat meetings you know like the cool thing about this is so everyone always says i always get frustrated when i hear a lawmaker say oh the senate's not what it used to be or congress isn't what it used to be things are broken today i don't think that's true i think you know going through the process i think that our founders were were totally genius in the way that they designed our system of government and what i saw is you just have to work it so everyone knows the power of their vote some would give it to me easily some wouldn't give it to me easily some would trade it for other things some would withhold it because they were pissed about other things and it was just hand to hand combat so it's just making calls using the phone going walking the halls going to lunches you know hosting dinners at my house it was just it was a nonstop lobbying effort and and by the way it was also adjudicating issues and making people feel like they were heard hearing their issues and then trying to find solutions that you don't put something in that then tips off where you lose you know a whole coalition so it was really a balancing act but it was it's an amazing thing and worked very closely on that with van jones and jessica jackson who also gave me a lot of help on the left and and it was an amazing thing had a great team too so you mentioned the importance of trust at the very beginning of the conversation from the outsider perspective just a maybe a dark question which is like how much trust is there in washington how how how much the flip side of that how much backstabbing is there can you form like long term relationships with people on a basic human level where you know you're not going to be betrayed screwed over manipulated for again going back to the old money and power the answer is yes and the answer is no so i i made some incredible friends lifelong friends through my time in washington but the way i i i think about it from politics and i think in geopolitics as well is i would say that politicians really don't have friends politicians have interests and as long as you kind of follow that rule you should be able to know how to rate where your relationship with a given person falls in the spectrum but i do think i was the exception i did make some tremendous friends and again i'd go back to what i said about negotiation where you know when you're in a situation where there's really nothing in it for any of you personally but you're in a fox altogether and nobody in washington could get anything done by themselves you have people coming from all different backgrounds all different experiences all different geographies coming together agreeing on an objective creating a plan and then every day rowing together in order to get it done it's a beautiful thing and you really learn what people are about and so when you go through an experience like that you learn who's in it for themselves you learn who's in it for the cause and you know for every you know thing you read about in the press of a fight i had with somebody because we were at odds you know i have about you know a hundred people who have become lifelong friends because i respect the way that when we were under fire together they got better they were competent and they were there to serve for the right reason and so so i i guess the answer is yes it it it is it is possible you have to be careful because there are a lot of mercurial people there i always say the politicians are like gladiators i didn't have as much respect for politicians till i got there but if you think about it everyone who's got a congressional seat or a senate seat there's twenty five people back at home who want their job who think they're smarter than them who are trying to backstab them and so i always say that the political dynamic it's like in the private sector you're standing on on flat ground you choose which fights you take on when you take them on how you fight them in politics it's like you're standing on a ball and what you have to realize is that there's maybe like ten things that you have to do but there's a potential cost to taking on each one that might destabilize you you fall off the ball and then you lose your opportunity to pursue those you have to always be kind of marking everything to market and going through your calculations to make sure you can accomplish what you want to without falling off the ball and losing your opportunity to make a difference i guess people like power and i just feel like to be a good politician you should be willing like good meaning good for humanity be willing to let go of power you know try to do the right thing if there's somebody back home that does manipulative stuff screws you over and takes power from you it's okay i feel like that kinda humility is is required to be a great leader and i feel like that's actually a good way to have long term power because karma has a viral aspect to it just be doing good by others i feel like is i i'd like to say that's true lex i i think it's just way more complicated i mean you look what happened this week with with kevin mccarthy right he did what he thought was morally right he thought you know he did a bipartisan deal he was told that you know they would have his back and then the moment things got tough they they cut him loose so again i don't know if that's that's if that was the right thing or the wrong thing right i've also seen leaders on the other end say i'm gonna do things that are short term more selfish but the way they justify to themselves is to say i believe that myself staying in power is existential to the greater good so i will do things that maybe are not in the greater good now because i believe that my maintaining power is and so it's it's complicated in an idealized world i'd love to believe that's the case but it's just way more complicated than that yeah i wish it wasn't but it is yeah i mean i i do just wish people zoomed out and people in politics zoomed out a bit and just ask themselves what are we all doing this for you know like sometimes you can get like a little bit lost in the game of it if you zoom out you realize like integrity is way more important than like little gains in money or little gains in power in the long term this is when you look yourself in the mirror at the end of the day and also how history remembers you i just feel like people do some dark stuff when they're like in that moment when they're losing power and they try to hold on a little too hard mhmm this is when this is when they can do really dark things like bring out the worst in themselves and it's just sad to see it i wish there was a kind of machinery of government would inspire people to be their best selves in their last days versus their worst selves right when that system gets invented you know you'll you'll share with me what it is but it's look let me give you another way to frame it which is and and this was kind of the the revelation we spoke before about you know kind of when i was getting my butt kicked by the russian investigation and all the different areas but kind of the basic framework i looked at was i said okay you know this all feels tough but i said the game's the game the game's been here you know way longer you know the way before i came and it'll be here way long after i leave and so i have two choices i can complain that the game's tough it's not fair it's not moral or i can go and i can try to play the game as hard as possible and i think that there's two different things right you have people who are willing to kind of sit in the stands and they're willing to yell at the players or or or or or or or or make their their their points known or you have people who are willing to suit up and get in the arena and go play and i have a lot of respect for people who who suit up and go play and and again some of them you know i wish they would play for different means but the fact that they're willing to put their name on the ballot make the sacrifice and go put on the pads and get hit and hit others i i think that you need those people and i wish more people who had maybe the moral wiring that you discussed would be putting on a helmet and go into play because it's hard it's hard i agree with you i just would love to fix the aspect of the the russia collusion accusation the virality the power of that because that's a really discouraging thing for for people maybe it's the way it has to be but it's it's it seems like a disincentive to people to participate it it is but i'll give you again a an optimistic side of it is that you know what you're seeing now with social media is i do think with what's happening at x there is now more of a reversion towards more egalitarian right and egalitarianism of information and so for many years the media publications were the gate holders they were the gatekeepers and then you had these social media companies that grew they became so powerful but then they were tilting the scales why they were doing it you know we can go through long explanations for that but if there truly is a real forum and a democratization of of information then you would think that the marketplace of ideas would surface the real ones and discredit mhmm the non real ones and i think that as a society we're starting to kinda come to grips with the fact that the power dynamic is changing and that some of these institutions that we used to have a lot of faith in don't deserve our faith and some of them you know will actually reform and maybe re earn our faith so i think that there there there could be an optimistic tone again the the years of trump i think that you know he was an outsider and you know he represented something that was existential for this to the system right you think about for the thirty years before you were either part of you know the clinton dynasty or the bush dynasty i think a lot of people in the country felt like that whole class whether you're wearing a red shirt or a blue shirt wasn't representing them and trump represented a true outsider to that system and i do think that as he went in there there was a lot of norms that were broken to try to stop him from changing the traditional power structure so i think that we're at a time where maybe there will be an optimistic breakthrough where you'll have institutions that will allow for a lot more transparency into what truth really is i'd love to go back and talk to you about the middle east because there's so many interesting components to this let's talk about saudi arabia and first let me ask you about mbs mohammed bin salman the crown prince so you've gotten to know him pretty well you've become friends with him what's he like as a human being just on a basic human level what's he like so for for the listeners mohammed bin salman is now the crown prince of saudi arabia he has risen to that position over the last couple of years and he's been a tremendous reformer for the country he's gone in and he's really modernized the economy he's he's put a lot more investment into the country he's marginalized the religious police and he's really done a good job to bring modernization a lot of reform so he's been a great reformer what he's like as a person is he's very high energy he's got tremendous candle power very very smart incredibly well read when he was younger his father would would give him a book a week and make him report on it on on the weekend he was trained as a as a leader and as a politician really by his father he's not western educated so he grew up in the saudi culture and he's a real saudi nationalist he he loves their history loves their heritage has a deep understanding of of of the tribal nature of the region and you know his father was actually known to be a tremendous politician so when he was governor of riyadh people who i speak to today about him say that if they had a a full election he would have won in a landslide they say every time somebody went to the hospital he was the first person to call anytime there was a funeral he was the first person to show up he's a very very beloved leader mohammed bin salman he was a businessman before he got into crown prince so he thinks really with a business mindset about how he runs the country and he's brought i think a different mindset and energy to the middle east you know one thing i'll i'll i'll say that maybe that comes to mind here is that i remember early on talking with him about all the different initiatives he was taking on he he's building a big city called neom in in the desert in a place where there really was nothing on the red sea and a lot of people were criticizing the ambition of the plan and i was sitting with him one night and i said you know why why are you taking on all these things you know you've got a lot of different programs but you know what most politicians do is they set lower expectations and then they exceed the expectations and he looked at me without hesitation he says jared you know the way i look at it is that in five years from now if i set five goals and i achieve five goals i'll achieve five things if i set a hundred goals and i fail at fifty of them then five years i'll accomplish fifty things and so it's a very different mindset as a leader the way i i got to work with him was saudi arabia was a big topic in the campaign president trump was basically saying during the campaign that you know we're gonna you know they've gotta pay for their fair share it's they they haven't been a great partner in in the region he's very critical of saudi and then during the transition i was asked by several friends to meet with a representative of saudi arabia i said i don't wanna meet with them you know but i came over and i met and they said well we wanna make changes and i said well you have to make changes you know to how you treat women then women couldn't drive they had guardianship laws so you you gotta start working with israel you know you have to be paying more of your fair share and you have to be you know stopping the wahhabism that that's being spread again i had no knowledge these were just kind of the traditional talking points about saudi arabia so the guy i was with basically said as a guy fad al tunze who's a very respected minister there he says jared he says you know you don't know much about saudi arabia do you i said no no no i i don't just really what i really what i i've kind of been told or what i read and he says okay let me let me do this we wanna be great allies with america we've we've traditionally been great allies with america can i come back to you with a proposal on ways that we can make progress on all of the different areas where we have joint interests and keep in mind at that point in time the middle east was a mess and probably the single biggest issue we had after isis was the ideological battle if you remember in two thousand sixteen there was the pulse nightclub shooting in orlando you had the san bernardino shooting and people were being radicalized online with the extremism and then there was a lot of crimes that were being that were happening because of that it was a big topic in the campaign and so that when i was thinking about you know talking different generals and what capabilities the us had to really combat the extremism and the ideological battle what we realized was that saudi arabia is the custodian of the two holiest sites in islam the mecca medina that that would be the best partner to work with if they were willing to but for years they really hadn't been willing to kinda lean into this fight so i said sure give a proposal so they come back give a proposal and they said look if you make president trump's first trip to saudi arabia we will do all these different things we'll increase our military spending and cooperation we'll counter all the terror financing unbelievable layer so i took the proposal i went to the national then it was general flynn i said if saudi arabia did these things would this be considered a big unbelievable but it will never happen i said well they're telling me they want to do these things again i having no foreign policy experience i'm just saying i've got somebody telling me they want to do it and that's kind of where we started again to office i don't think much more about it and then i think it was like maybe a month in president trump has a call with king salman mhmm and before the call we're in the oval office and the president's basically saying well you know this is what we wanna go through and i have secretary mattis and secretary tillerson the minister of defense and the secretary of state basically saying you have to deal with mbn mbn is is the guy who's been our partner for all these years he's the head of intelligence and he's been a great partner i said well if he's been a great partner then why do we have all these problems that you guys are complaining about with saudi mhmm i said i've been told that we have this proposal from mbs who's the deputy crown prince and that's who we should be dealing with on this and so the phone call starts and president trump listened to both of us and on the phone call with king salman president trump says okay we'll go through all these things these are the things we wanna get done and he says well who should we deal with and king salman says deal with my son the deputy crown prince mbs and so president trump said on the phone have him deal with jared because i think he knew that if he put put him with the other guys they were not believers in what he had the ability to do and that's how i got assigned to work with him i get back to my office after that have an email from him spoke to him for the first time and then we just went to work and you know a lot of people were betting against that trip they thought it wasn't gonna be successful and they've been betting against him and he's been underestimated but he's been doing an incredible job and the whole middle east is different today because of the work that he's done maybe it's instructive to go through the mental journey that you went on from like the talking points the basic narratives the the very basic talking points understanding of saudi arabia to making that human connection with mbs and making the policy connection that it's actually possible to solve problems like what was that journey like why was it so difficult to take for others and why were you effective in being able to take that journey yourself maybe some of it came from my inexperience but my desire to listen and hear people so you know i had this proposal i was told that all of these things were good then we're trying to schedule this trip and the national security council calls a meeting where we're in the situation room and we have you know homeland security secretary of defense secretary of state and everyone's saying this is gonna be a disaster they said you know if we go to saudi arabia the saudis never keep their promises and our secretary of state at the time was a gentleman named rex tillerson mhmm who'd been the ceo of exxon so he dealt with all these play people very extensively and he basically said in my experience the saudis won't come through and jared you don't know what you're doing you're wasting your time and i basically was at a point where i said look guys but they're saying they wanna do all these things shouldn't we at least give them a chance to try to do it like why do we want to predetermine their their their direction by not giving them a chance to change just because things in the past haven't gotten the way you want them to that doesn't mean they can't go that way in the future so we fought the battle you know they basically deferred and and let me go through with it but when i do the planning meetings for the trip nobody would show up because they all thought it was gonna be an absolute disaster and by the way they probably weren't wrong to think that because i'd never planned a foreign trip before and i'd never done any foreign policy before so during the planning i'd speak to mbs almost every day and i'd go through all the different details and the things that would be coming up and i said look i really need to get these things in writing he sent over a guy doctor masada laban who's a tremendous diplomat for them and he came to washington stayed for three weeks and we worked through all the different details of what we needed and we ended up coming to an arrangement on what it should be so you know i think about now in retrospect why i was so focused on getting things like this done and why i i even believed that they could be possible but the answer is is really the people i was talking to on the other end were telling me that these things were possible and so just because they hadn't been done before and just because others around me didn't believe that they could be done i wasn't willing to just say well let's not try it just seems like that cynicism that takes over is paralyzing and you sent me a great essay from from paul graham i'm a big fan of that i think explains a lot of your success the essay is called how to do great work and people should go definitely read the full essay there's a few things i could read from it some quotes having new ideas is a strange game because it usually consists of seeing things that were right under your nose once you've seen a new idea it tends to seem obvious why did no one think of this before seeing something obvious sounds easy and yet empirically having new ideas is hard and like the steps you took seem trivial and yet nobody was taking them or at least in the past they weren't successful so the successes you've had were as simple as essentially picking up the phone or trying mhmm there's a lot of interesting things here to talk about this aspect of doing this seemingly simple that seems to be so hard to do it as paul describes requires a willingness to break rules there are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules to enjoy breaking them and to be indifferent to them that's an interesting distinction i call these two cases being aggressively and passively independent minded so again that's to enjoy breaking the rules or to be indifferent to the rules the aggressively independent minded are the naughty ones rules don't merely fail to stop them breaking rules gives them additional energy for this sort of person delight at the sheer of audacity of a project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it started the other way to break the rules is not to care about them at all or perhaps even to know they exist this is why novices and outsiders often make new discoveries their ignorance of a field ignorance maybe in quotes or a field's assumptions act as a source of temporary passive independent mindedness aspies also seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs several i know say that this helps them to have new ideas so the aggressive and the passive is such an interesting way of looking at it perhaps some aspect of this at least in the story you tell there's some passive aspect where you're like not even acknowledging not even caring that there was rules just kinda asking the simple question and taking the simple action i think that is funny that that was an essay i read and we're doing just a snippet of it but i would encourage anyone listening to go and find it and read the entire thing because it's something that really spoke to me as i was transitioning into my new career now and i just loved it but when we were talking about why certain people who don't have traditional qualifications are able to come in and do incredible work and solve complex problems it made me think of that essay which is why i shared it and i i think that in the context of the work that i was doing here perhaps not having the historical context became an advantage and obviously went back and then tried to study it but if you go into a problem i always find that especially in the political realm my favorite political issues are ones where they're contrarian by being obvious and you know sometimes they feel very intuitive and so you take them on there's always a lot of resistance when you go against something that's been accepted as the way that you're supposed to do things and i came to learn over the course of my time in government that when everyone was agreeing with what i was doing then it actually made me more nervous because i felt like you have these problems they haven't been solved for a long time and then if you take the same approach as others you're gonna fail just like they did so taking a different approach doesn't mean you're gonna succeed but at least if you fail you're gonna fail in an original way and so i i did like this a lot and i i think that you know what i saw was the people who were very good at getting things done that hadn't been done before were people who came with different qualifications different perspectives and they came in and and really worked the problem in untraditional ways and so i think in the middle east i came in with a very different approach than people before me not because i came in deliberately trying to do it differently but because i came in trying to listen and understand from people why the problem hadn't been solved and then think from a first principles perspective on what's the right perspective today not based on what happened fifty years ago or not based on what somebody's feelings who were hurt but what's the right thing to make people's lives better to make the world a safer and and and more prosperous place tomorrow so if we can go back to mbs for a little bit from the person to the vision there's something called vision twenty thirty about his vision for saudi arabia in the future can you maybe look from his perspective what is his vision for the region sure so you know it's funny we were talking before about how you know we wish leaders would set big audacious goals and take on big things well that's what he did with vision twenty thirty you know when he was young and again this is something that was derided and a lot of people were very skeptical of it but the people who actually you know picked it up and read it said this is a very thoughtful plan that's very achievable so he studied his country and said what's our place in the world what are our advantages what are our disadvantages and then he set publicly kpis that he wanted to hold his country to and then put in place plans and committees and really worked hard to push things in that direction which is pretty remarkable i think that it's something when i saw it i thought it was very refreshing i said wait in america why don't we all have you know set goals why don't we have kpis and i do think that it's something that most countries if not all countries should have right one of my favorite quotes was from the alice in wonderland where the the cheshire cat says if you don't know where you're going it doesn't matter which path you take and so i think that that's something that really helped set them on a good path and they've been very successful with it one of the things he told me about putting that together was he said you know my father's generation they created this country from almost nothing they came here they were a poor country they were bedouins in the desert and then they look back and see what they've done over fifty years and they say it's absolutely remarkable he said his generation they come in and they say we're very grateful for everything that's been done to date but we have so much opportunity that we're not taking advantage of and so you know he's now empowered the next generation to be ambitious and think big and grow with it what that means for his vision for the middle east is that you know the the the general architecture that should exist and now there's excitement in the discussions with israel that have advanced was the general view of what we thought from a trump perspective should be the new middle east is having an economic and security corridor all the way from haifa muscat from oman to israel where basically you go through and if you can create a a security area where people can live you know free of fear of of terrorism and of conflict the middle east for the last twenty years has been a sinkhole for for for for arms for death for terrorism it's been you know awful it's been a big national security threat for america a big place where our you know our our treasure is gone we've had a lot of our our young amazing american soldiers killed in in action there and and the same thing for the arab countries as as well so if we can create a a security architecture for that region and then we can create economic integration between all the different countries i mean the amount of innovation happening in israel is unbelievable think of it like silicon valley is not connected to the rest of california you have a very young population a very digital savvy population you have a lot of resources and so if you can get that whole set the potential for it is unbelievable i i do think that that's his ultimate vision is to become a a really strong country economically and then to become a place where you could be funding advancements in science advancements in humanity advancements in artificial intelligence and and think about ways to be a positive influence in the world so difficult question one big source of tension between the united states and saudi is the case of jamal khashoggi i was wondering if you can comment on what mbs has said about it to you you've spoken to him about it and what mbs has said about it publicly on sixty minutes and after yeah so what he said to me was was no different than what he ultimately said on sixty minutes which was you know as as as somebody helping lead this country i bear responsibility and and i'm gonna make sure that those who were involved are brought to justice and i'm gonna make sure that that we put in place reforms to make sure things like this don't happen again it was a horrible situation that occurred what i saw from him after that was just a doubling and a tripling down on on the positive things he was doing figuring out ways to kinda continue to modernize his society build opportunity in in in the kingdom and to continue to be a better ally to all the different countries that wanted to be aligned with them one thing i learned from this case is how one particular situation a tragedy can destroy so much progress and the possibility of progress and and the possibility of connection between the bridges that are built between different nations mhmm and how narratives around that can take off and take such a long time to repair and you've worked with this in the middle east with israel and so on how the history the the narratives the stories they they kinda have this momentum that's so hard to break even when you have new leaders new blood new new ideas that come in and it it's just sad to see that yes this tragedy happens but it doesn't mean that you can't make progress i don't know if you have kinda lessons from that just how much of a dramatic impact it had on creating tension between the united states and saudi and and in general in the middle east like the that somehow saudi is not a friend but is against the ideals and the values of the united states yeah so it it definitely created massive tension and it became a very high profile action that actually overshadowed a lot of the good work that was being done in the region and a lot of the progress we were making but when you think about this or you think about the other issues that we've gone through today i think the general framework that i always try to approach things with is you can't change what happened yesterday you can only learn from it and then you can change how you deal with tomorrow and when i think about you know the people in power what do i hope that they're spending their time focused on number two basic things number one is how do i create you know safety and security for for my people and and for for the world and then how do i give people the opportunity to live a better life and so when things like this happen obviously you know there are certain reactions that are appropriate but ultimately you have to think through how do you not allow the paradigm that you're creating in the world to lead to worse outcomes than would happen otherwise and so when i would think about foreign policy in general one of the differences between foreign policy and business is that in business the conclusion of a problem set you finish a deal you either have you know a company or a property or if you sell it you have you know less to do and and and more capital hopefully if it's successful right in a political deal it's always about paradigms so the end of a problem set is always the beginning of a new paradigm and you're always thinking through how do you create an environment that leads to hopefully the best amount of positive outcomes that could occur versus creating a paradigm that will lead to negative outcomes so you know bad things happen you know a lot in the world and you have to make sure that when those happen you know people are held accountable for it but you also don't wanna make sure that in the process of making sure that there's accountability for these actions you don't set a lot of progress that the world is making back that will lead to worse off situation for many more people if we can go back to the incredible work with abraham accords in israel and the middle east first the big question about peace why is it so difficult to achieve peace in this part of the world between israel and palestine and between israel and the other countries in the middle east or any sort of peace like agreements if i had to give you the most simple answer i would say that it's structural and if you go back to the incentive structure of different leaders this whole peace process between israel and and the palestinians and again i've gotten criticized for saying this but it's what i believe so i'm gonna say it is that the incentive structure was all wrong and when i went before the united nations security council to discuss the peace plan that i proposed which again was more of an operational plan and it was a pragmatic plan it was over a hundred eighty pages in detail in politics people don't like putting forward detail because it just gives a lot of places for you to get criticized on nobody actually criticized the detail of my plan they just criticized the fact that it was coming from us and didn't want to debate the merits of the operational pieces of it so i created a slide where i showed from the oslo accords till the day i was there all the different peace discussions i put a dove in the slide for those and then i put a tank for every time there was a war there was always skirmishes between hamas and and hezbollah and and and the palestinians and then i showed two lines and they both went from the bottom of the page all the way up like this one of the lines was israeli settlements so every time a negotiation failed israel was able to get more land and every and then the other one was money to the palestinians and i said every time a negotiation failed the palestinians would get more money the problem with that money though was that it wasn't going to the people you know a lot some of it would make its way down but most of it was going to the politicians you had leadership of the palestinians who was basically i think at that point it's in like the sixteenth year of a four year term so it wasn't democratically elected and a lot of what i tried to show was that there was no rule of law there was no judicial system there were no property rights and there was no opportunity or hope for the people to live a better life and so all of the envoys to date were basically trained to go and do the same things and i again i got massively criticized by all the previous envoys for not doing it the same way they did but i thought the problem structurally just didn't make sense and so i felt like the incentive structure was all wrong and i took a different approach and so what's what's the different approach i started writing down a document these are the you know eleven issues but there's really only three issues that matter i said just tell me what you think the compromise is that you think the other side could live with that you would accept and it was very hard to get them talking about this oh you have to go back to nineteen seventy two you have to go back to nineteen eighty two you have to go back to two thousand one you have to go to canada and i was just like i don't need a headache and i don't need a history lesson just just i want a very simple thing here today in two thousand seventeen what's the outcome that you would accept and i was dealing with their their their negotiators their back channel secret negotiators their double secret and i was just like this whole thing is like it's a process created where nobody wants to talk about the actual solution so coming from the business world i said okay let me just write down a proposed solution that i think is fair and let me have each side react like don't tell me about theoretical things like tell me i wanna move the line from here to here i wanna change this word so i i tried to make it much more tactical and what i realized was like the palestinians they'd worked so hard to get the arab world to stay with the line of the arab peace initiative and so i went back and i read the arab peace initiative it was ten lines and it didn't have any detail so it was a concept and so they liked that concept because it allowed them to reject everything they kept getting more money i mean bibi netanyahu who runs one of the most incredible economies in the world who runs an incredible superpower militarily for the size of of their country he would fly to washington to meet us and he'd be taking a commercial el al plane mhmm abbas who runs a refugee organization a refugee group right that claims that they don't have a state that gets billions of dollars in eight year eight every year from the global community would fly in a sixty million dollar boeing bbj so the whole thing was just very corrupt and off and i do think that that's why it i don't think people were incentivized to solve it to be honest what do you think an actual plan on that part if you can just before we talk about abraham accords if there is a peace plan that works between israel and palestine what is it what do you think it looks like you have to separate it into two different issues and i think that that's actually how we came to the abraham accords is that you know i i i i was i tell the story in the book and it was one of my like favorite experiences during my time in diplomacy where i went to meet with sultan qaboos who was the sultan of oman and we fly out there because he'd had a a secret meeting with bibi and i thought maybe he was open to normalizing with israel so after he meets with bb he calls me and says i want you to come see me so i go over to see him and i again i tell the story it was a crazy you know night in all these different areas but when i was talking to him he basically says to me i feel badly for the palestinian people that they carry with them the burden of the muslim world and that line just like stuck with me and a couple days later i was thinking about it and i said wait a minute who elected the palestinian people to represent the muslim world on the al aqsa mosque and so the reason why i felt like it had never been solved was it was a riddle a that i believed was designed to not be solved but b you were conflating two separate issues you had the issue between israel and and the muslim world which really was the issue of the al aqsa mosque and then you had just a territorial dispute which throughout history you have lots of territorial disputes and they're usually resolved in different ways so if you go back to the israeli palestinian issue there's just a couple components you need to solve number one is territorial contiguity right you need to figure out where do you draw the lines and that's something that that you know you can talk about what people were owed seventy years ago but it's much more productive to say this is what you can make work today right and that's kinda what we did i'd we literally spent months and months drawing a map and we put something out probably change a couple lines here and there but by and large it was a very pragmatic solution that i think could work and i think it could work for the safety and security of israel which was number one so first issue is drawing a map second issue is security again israel and again this is one issue we were incredibly sympathetic with israel which is you can't expect you know a prime minister of israel to make a deal where he's gonna make his people less secure than before so we worked very closely with them on a security apparatus we laid something out that i think would keep the whole area safer and it would it would make sure israel was safe and also keep the palestinian issue safe so you need security number three was the religious sites and that was one that was actually always made much more complicated by people the al aqsa mosque because you basically have haram al sharif which is a place where the mosque was built in the seventh or eighth century but originally it was where the the holy of holies were in the beit hamikdash for the jewish people so and then you know compounding by the fact that you have all of the christian holy sites in jerusalem it's a city that should be bringing everyone together but in fact has become a place where you have you know wars and and and and and hatred and a lot of different conflicts that have risen because of it but what i said was instead of fighting over concepts of sovereignty which is interesting how i got to the notion that this wasn't really the big issue i basically said just operationally why don't we just make it simple let everyone come and be able to worship as long as they're being able to worship peacefully so that's really the contours of it and what the palestinians have done is they've kind of deflected from a lot of their own shortcomings and a lot of the arab leaders did that as well kind of in the pre abraham accords days by kind of allowing this issue to be so prevalent so one thing i'll say on the palestinians is that you know what we tried to do by laying out a plan was we said okay what are the reasons why the palestinian people are not having the lives that they deserve i'll give you a couple of things one is i studied the economies of you know jordan west bank gaza egypt morocco this was you know numbers from like two thousand nineteen but what was interesting was the gdp per capita of somebody living in the west bank was actually the same as jordan and it was actually more than somebody living in egypt and the debt of gdp that the palestinians had was like thirty forty percent compared to egypt which is at like a hundred and thirty percent and jordan which is at a hundred and ten percent and lebanon which is at two hundred percent and so you know you're in a situation where a lot of this stuff didn't make sense but if you draw lines create institutions where palestinian people can now feel like they have property rights and have ownership over their place and let the money flow past the leadership ranks you know to the people let them have jobs let them have opportunity and then let all muslims from throughout the world have access to the mosque and israel making sure that they can control the security which i think the jordanians and a lot of others want israel to to have strong you know security control there to prevent the radicalists and the extremists from coming you could have peace there very easily so there's a lot of things to say here one is just to emphasize alak salam's mask so this is this holy place and this is something in our conversations and in my own travels i've seen the importance of sort of frictionless access to those sites from the entirety of the muslim world and that's what abraham of course took big leaps on okay so we'll talk about that a little bit more but that's kind of a religious component that's a a dignity in the religious practice and faith component but then the other thing you mentioned so simply which is you have money flow past the leadership ranks how do you have money flow past the leadership ranks in in palestine so make sure that the money that's invested in palestine the west bank gets to the people so to date all of the aid that's been given to the palestinians has been an entitlement it's not conditions based it's always just we give them money and there's no expectations it's very simple you make the aid conditions based you fight for transparency you do it through institutions other than the pa or you put reformers into the pa that will allow it to go down that way pa being the palestinian authority which is the leadership it's not hard to do it just takes people who actually wanna do it but i think that the the mindset of the international community has not been let's solve this problem it's like let's just throw a little bit of money the money's novocain let's put a little novocain on the problem and let's not have to deal with it but nobody's ever said oh let's do an accounting of the twenty billion dollars we've given them and see how many jobs it's done and where it's gone that just hasn't happened again it's an incredibly corrupt organization unrwa you think about the post world war ii dynamic you had a lot of refugees my grandparents were refugees post world war ii every other refugee class has been resettled and you only have one permanent refugee organization ever created why was this done it was done to perpetuate the conflict so that a lot of arab leaders could basically deflect from a lot of their shortcomings at home and so i think for israel they view all these things as existential they value their safety they've been under attack for a long time i do think having a deal where we can say how do you know the jews and the muslims krishna come together i think king abdullah from jordan's been an incredible custodian for the mosque i think everyone in my travels recognize that he's the right guy for that that king of jordan should be the custodian of of the mosque we should have some kind of framework to make sure everyone has access the more countries that have diplomatic relations with israel the more muslims and arabs that should be able to come and and visit and by the way the more you have these normalizations think about what that will do to the economy of the west bank where they'll have you know great hotels hospitality tremendous tourism industry because of all the christian muslim and jewish holy sites that they have there so there's a lot of potential there we just have to like get unstuck and i believe that it's so possible if the leaders wanna make tomorrow better that they can and unfortunately the people who suffer the most are really are are just the palestinian people and i think that you know in gaza they're hostages to to hamas and and in the west bank they're just they're just held back because their leadership just is afraid or or or too self interested to give them the opportunity to change their paradigm and pursue the potential of what they have and by the way it's an incredibly well educated population it it's it's an incredibly capable population and they're right next to israel where the economy they need everything and so the potential should be incredible if you can just move some of these pieces but again there's still a lot of emotion and hatred you have to work through as well but i do believe that you're not gonna solve that by litigating the past you're only gonna solve that by creating an exciting paradigm for the future and getting everyone to buy in and then move towards that and maybe increase the chance of being able to establish an economy where the entrepreneurs can flourish in the west bank and so on in palestine once the the relationship across the arab world is normalized so so one thing on that which is very interesting is when i got into my job in in in in the middle east all of the conventional thinkers said to me the separation in the muslim world is between the sunnis and the shias and that's really the big divide and as i was traveling i didn't think there was any divide in that regard the divide that i saw was between leaders who wanted to give a better opportunity for their people and create economic reforms and opportunity and leaders who wanted to use religion or fear to keep their stronghold on power and so if you think about who's not creating the opportunity for their people it's the palestinian leadership and the iranian leadership mhmm all the other arab countries were focused on how do we give opportunity for our people to live a better life and there is a big foundation on which that framework can succeed which i think is the in general the idea of arab israeli normalization so that's where abraham accords come in mhmm can you tell the story of that sure so it's an amazing thing and i i sit here today you know somebody not in government and you know every day i see you know another you know flight that goes between or i i see you know an israeli student studying at a university in dubai or a new synagogue opening up in in abu dhabi and it it just gives me such or bahrain it gives me such tremendous pride to see all of the progress that's been made how it occurred part of why i wrote the book was to put this down for for history's sake to go through all the different intentional unintentional circumstantial things that occurred it's fine we left government there's a lot of people saying well this is why i know that i said i was kind of at the middle of it and i couldn't even perfectly articulate why it happened because it was a it was an evolution of a lot of things and i joke that we made peace on plan c but only because we went through the alphabet three times failing at every letter and by the time but we didn't give up we kept going and we got it done and maybe this is a a good place to also step back and say what is arab israeli normalization sure what is the state of things for people who may not be aware before the progress you made that's probably the best place to start so what we did is we we made a peace deal between israel and the united arab emirates and then israel and bahrain then we did a deal with israel and sudan then israel and kosovo israel and morocco where basically countries that didn't recognize each other before ended up recognizing each other all of these were muslim majority countries and getting them to integrate with israel was a very big thing the traditional thinking had always been was that muslim arab countries would not make peace with israel until the israeli palestinian issue was solved and what we were able to do is separate the issues and then make these make these connections which are leading to amazing interaction between jews and muslims so when i think about kind of obviously you have national security you have emotional benefits from these things but the the single biggest benefit that i've seen from the accords is that if you were an arab or a muslim and you were and you were willing to say positive things about israel or the jews before this came out you had been viciously attacked by the media or the hordes of influencers or the extremists in these different countries what this did was it brought out into the public the fact that jews and muslims can be together and they can be respectful they can have meals together and that the cultures can live together in peace so just to linger on this it's it's like once subtle and and in another sense like transformative so normalization means you're allowed to travel from one place to the other that has a kinda ripple effect of that you can now start talking in a little bit more accepting way you can start integrating traveling communicating doing business with socializing so the cultures mix conversations mix all of this and then this kinda has a ripple effect on the basic connection between these previously disparate worlds i don't know if there's a a nice way to kinda make clear why these agreements have such a transformative effect especially in the long term i i would say the simplest form is it's just a mindset and it's almost like you're taught all your life we're enemies or we can't be friends with that tribe on the other side of the fence and then like one day the leaders get up and say no it's okay now and there was never an issue between the people the people were just taught different things and they were separated from each other but again one of the things that i respect about the work you do is you believe in the power of conversation and the power of human interaction and you know these issues and and gaps between us feel so big when we think about them when we're told about them when we read about them but when we go and sit with each other all of a sudden we realize maybe we have a lot more in common than we have that divides us for me what i've seen about it that's made the biggest difference is i've seen people who wouldn't have the ability to be together be together and that's now forming a nucleus of togetherness which is a restoration so you think about the modern middle east from from post holocaust to now again in nineteen forty eight after the the that war of independence you had jews living in baghdad and cairo then they became so anti jewish that they then expelled all of the jews from all these capitals of those cities so you think about the jewish history in baghdad i mean i think the talmud was written in baghdad it was a place where in in babylon where the jewish people thrived i think in five seventy bc when nebuchadnezzar conquered jerusalem he took about ten thousand jews back with him to babylon because he thought it'd be good for his economy and during that that that place the jews actually flourished and had a good life there so for a thousand years before the second world war the jews and the muslims lived very peacefully together so people say that what we're doing now is is an aberration i actually think it's not an aberration i think it's actually a return to the time where people can live together culturally and so this is the beginning of the end of the arab israeli conflict and it's the beginning of togetherness which again you think about how much war how much provocation how much terrorism has been made in the name of of of religious conflict this is i think the start of the process of religious respect and understanding we've talked about you being attacked in the press for the russian collusion and other topics one of the most recent set of attacks comes on the topic of saudi public investment fund giving two billion dollars to your investment firm after you left government so that includes a one point two five percent asset management fee of twenty five million dollars a year can you respond to these recent set of attacks sure so left government obviously worked for four years i you know it was a a very action packed time that's why i wrote the book i wanted to put down all those experiences i started thinking like what do i wanna do next right so my previous career i'd been in real estate i i'd worked with my brother on some technology businesses that i'd started and then i got into government so i i kinda had a career shift right in my previous career obviously was very successful the new york times they violated and they published my financial my financial statements they showed i was making about fifty million dollars a year in the private sector before i went to government i went into government and i you know i volunteered i didn't take a salary i i paid for my own health insurance for four years my wife and i and then we went and i was thinking should i go back to my old company or should i start something new and my thinking was is that i'd through my time in government i'd met so many people i'd learned so much about the world i i had a big understanding now for how the macroeconomic picture worked and i did feel like there was a lot more that i could do than just going back to real estate in the meantime i was getting a lot of calls from different ceos and companies saying you know can you help me with this company can you help me with that company your knowledge could be helpful to help this company navigate this challenge or to expand internationally and so i said you know what maybe i should create a business to do an investment firm where i can do something different where i'm putting together geopolitical expertise and traditional private equity and growth investing and figure out how to do that where i can do something differentiated where i can invest in in growing things and help with my navigation skills and relationships so that was kind of the thesis of what i thought could make sense as kind of a next step i i called you know different friends they were very excited to to back the effort obviously this was coming off the success that i just had in the middle east where i did you know six peace deals there and you know one of the notions i want to be able to do with the firm was to be able to take money from the gulf and then to be able to invest it in israel to continue to build the economic links between the countries again if countries have more economic ties i think war and fighting is is is less likely and then in addition to that i wanted to figure out how do you bring the entrepreneurs together from both of those countries so that was really the mission of what i set out to do so far i've been enjoying it it's been a lot of fun i've i've been learning a ton i think we're doing very well with it in terms of the criticisms i think that i've been criticized in every step of everything i've always done in my life and so what i would say is you know this business is actually an objective metric business right it's about returns so you know in three four years from now five years from now see how i do hopefully i'll do very well and judge me based on that in terms of any of the nefarious things know i haven't been accused of any of of violating any laws and you know i haven't violated any of the ethics rules either when i was in government i i every year submitted all my financial to the office of government ethics they certified it every year and i followed every rule and every law possible so so to my critics i'll say criticize me before you'll criticize me now i'm gonna keep doing me and gonna keep pursuing things that i think are worthwhile and i'm very excited about this chapter of my career maybe this is a good place to ask in working closely with donald trump what in your sense looking into the mind of of the man what's the biggest strength of of donald trump as a leader i would say his unpredictability i think that as a leader he's he consumes a ton of information he doesn't like to be managed or have his information filtered so he'll speak to a lot of people to draw his information himself he's very pragmatic i don't see him as terribly ideological i see him as somebody who's about results i think he wants to deliver results and i think ultimately i mean he he's an incredible fighter he's he's a big counterpuncher but he also wants to get along with people and that's probably the biggest surprise that people found with him i mean you know you look at even situations like i would always tell people if you disagree with him don't go on television and criticize him just pick up the phone and call him and go see him and he'll talk to you about it he may not agree with you but again that's what kim kardashian did when she had a case of clemency with a woman alice johnson that she felt strongly about we went through the case i wouldn't have had her call if i didn't think it was a legitimate case so we spent about eight months quietly working through the case working through the details to make sure that it really was a worthy case i brought it to president trump said you know she'd like to come meet with you to to talk about this case and he said perekman so she came in we went through the case and president trump ultimately granted the clemency to alice johnson who was a a woman who was accused of being part of a a drug ring she had basically a life sentence for doing it she'd served twenty two years in prison while in prison i mean she's basically was a grandmother and she she was you know putting on the prison plays she was mentoring you know young women in prison somebody who again there's always a risk but by and large had a very very very low risk of of committing a crime in the future and then it goes back to the notion of are we gonna judge people by the worst decision they make in their life and so president trump was willing to grant the climate scene no end and i think that it just goes to the notion of like maybe this goes back to his unpredictability in a positive way which is if you go sit with him and you make your case he'll hear you he'll listen to you and he's not afraid to act and he's not afraid to be controversial which i think is a good thing so from a foreign policy point of view in particular his unpredictability just meant that everyone was always on their back foot people were afraid to kinda cross america and what i would tell people who don't like trump is i would say think about how crazy he's making you and and his enemies you know he did that to the enemies of america and and yeah so he was a very very strong president and i think did a a great job so in some of these agreements that we've been talking about and and speaking with leaders how do you think the unpredictability helps so in all the agreements that i was negotiating i wasn't doing it as a principal i was doing it on behalf of president trump and people knew that i had access to president trump and they knew that you know i could say i i you may say this that we don't like but i'm gonna have to take it back to him and then we'll see what he does and one of the biggest instances was on the usmca trade deal where that deal happened because mexico was legitimately concerned and smartly so that president trump was going to impose tariffs on the car industry which would have been decimating to their economy and by the way he was ready to do it we were holding him back from doing it with every ounce of strength that we could so it wasn't a bluff i mean that one was actually real but they were smart to read that it was real and ultimately we created a great win win deal tell you a funny story it just popped into my mind from from the tariffs is we did also we used a a two thirty two national security exemption to protect our steel industry and we put tariffs on steel and aluminum and again i i thought about this because we also negotiated them with canada and there was a very funny phone call where trudeau was calling trump and again they got along you know decently well and trudeau's calling saying you can't put national security tariffs on us in canada you know we're we're we're your nato ally we we fought wars with you we do military together and trump says to him didn't you burn the white house down in eighteen twelve and trump says that was the french he says no it was the canadians and so it was just you know like i said he's always keeping everyone on their toes yeah and but he was he he he he wasn't he took very calculated risks and like i said you know everyone was outraged all the time with everything but if you look at his body of work people said if he was elected he would start world war three meanwhile we inherited a world filled with wars no new wars right three years he made peace deals no new wars he was tough he was strong people respected him he built relationships and got trade deals done got peace deals done the economy was rocking his body work i think was pretty strong as president like you said no new wars this makes me think if donald trump won the presidency what the the current situation in ukraine would look like but let me just ask you zoom out and ask you broadly do you think the war in ukraine could have been avoided and what do you think it takes to bring it to an end i think a hundred percent it would have been avoided not ninety nine percent you know president trump for four years had no problems with russia you know we were we were arming ukraine but we were working with russia and again the first two years we had a little bit of issue working with russia because they were accused of colluding with us since we had to go through that investigation but but in the second two years we were trying to focus russia on what are the areas where we can collaborate together i think russia you know we thought it was in their strategic advantage to play us and china against each other because of the way that everything was done before they were stuck with china but not getting a lot for it under bush they took georgia under obama they took crimea under trump there was no problems and then under biden unfortunately i think they misplayed a couple of things which i think provoked you know russia to to go forward still no excuse to do what they did i think that the invasion was a terrible thing and and should not have occurred but with that being said i think a hundred percent if trump was president there would not be a war in ukraine today coming to the table and negotiating a piece whether it's donald trump whether it's biden whether it's anybody what do you think it takes do you think it's possible and if you're in a room if jared kushner is in the room vladimir putin and vladimir zelensky what does it take to have a productive conversation and what does it take for that conversation to fail like what are the trajectories that lead to success and failure i think we go back to negotiations number one is trust right both leaders have to have the ability to communicate what an off ramp is without fearing it's gonna leak to the public so if you go to the posture of zelensky right now and by the way president zelensky i have a lot of respect for the courage he showed especially initially you know you saw what ghani did in afghanistan they they were getting attacked by the taliban he took the cash and got the hell out of there staying in kiev when he did how he did it was one of the most brave things we've seen in a long time mhmm and he has a ton of my respect and admiration for doing that but now he's promising his people we're gonna win the war and the military action has not necessarily coincided with that sentiment and so there has to be some form of of off ramp but he can't say that publicly so for him to be able to work privately with somebody who can help create a new paradigm where both leaders can say we're gonna stop the bloodshed we're gonna stop the risk of nuclear war for the world we're gonna stop what's happening that's really what it will take how that occurs again it's not something i'm involved in now so i don't know who the right broker is or how to put that together but essentially they need somebody in between them who can figure out how do you create a landing zone that that works because neither party's gonna jump until the pool is filled with water and you have to outline what the go forward looks like because you can't just stop it for them to get worse for both parties you have to you have to move it forward into what happens next that hopefully can start to turn the tide to benefit both sides where they can focus on the future instead of being stuck into the old paradigm of who started what who's to blame for what who did what to who it's just a lot of tough stuff now that that's occurred that's gonna be hard to walk back and it's a big task to get it done but for the sake of the world it'd be amazing if we're able to reach a conclusion to that conflict just going back to the your earlier mention of north korea what do you think it takes to bring vladimir putin and vladimir zelensky to the table together leadership so you you you're saying like it has to be a us president it has to be somebody who's willing to put themself on the line yeah to go and do it and you know again if you're the us president and you're the most powerful nation in the world you should be trying yeah but i do think again the posture that the us has taken has probably been in a place where they it would be very hard for them to get the trust of russia based on the way that they've played their moves to date and i always thought from the beginning that putin would try to bring in president xi in china to resolve it to basically give a big screw you to america to say you know china's now the one you know in charge of this but that hasn't seemed to manifest itself to date either but it takes leadership you know the leaders have to get it and say you know let's get everyone together and let's try to get this done because every day it goes on a more people are dying and b you know we do risk nuclear war for the world which is not a good situation let me ask since you helped set up phone calls between donald trump putin and king of saudi arabia if i were to interview putin what advice would you give on how to get a deep understanding of the human being yeah so i didn't deal with russia a ton but in my interaction with with putin and with russia you know i i would kinda point out a couple of things number one is when america was hit with covid and new york was looking like we were gonna run out of ventilators and masks russia was the second country that sent us a plane load of supplies and they didn't send that because they hate america they sent that because we were starting to make progress together as countries and they thought that they wanted to show goodwill to figure out how can we start working together and again people may attack me for saying that that sounds naive again the past you know fifteen years may show that that's not the case but i don't believe that countries have permanent enemies and i don't believe countries have permanent allies right again you think about the us and russia in world war two we worked together to to defeat the nazis right and now we're great allies with germany who basically was our great enemy in in world war ii we're great allies with japan who was our great enemy in world war ii so it goes back to the notion we discussed earlier of you shouldn't condemn tomorrow to be like yesterday if you're unhappy with yesterday so so number one is i would definitely ask him about that the phone call that you mentioned was after we did a pretty intense negotiation to create the largest oil cut in the history of of oil production so during covid demand just shut off like crazy and it was it was stopping very quickly saudi and russia at that time were having a conflict they created this thing called opec plus which goes back again history between the two countries where they had conflicts and then all of a sudden they were working together to try to stabilize the oil markets but they couldn't agree on the cuts so saudi actually increased production so you had two things hitting at once where saudi and russia were both increasing production and demand was dropping so you were headed for a real crisis and i was starting to get calls from a lot of the oil industry executives here in america saying you don't understand we can't just like flip a switch and turn off our oil wells like we're running out of storage here and i said look i president trump likes low oil prices so he's not upset about what's happening you have to call him and if he gives me permission or the instruction then i can try to intervene but but right now he's not inclined to intervene after a little bit he said you know what it's time get involved go do it it was right over passover this is during covid i spent three days nonstop on the phone with kirill dimitrov from russia and with with mbs directly and i was dealing with dan berlet who is our energy minister you know going back and forth and it was like it was crazy i mean it was just one of the craziest negotiations we ended up agreeing on the largest oil cut in the history of the world but the story you went to before which was pretty funny was finally make the deal and we set up a call between king salman vladimir putin and president trump to announce the deal i'm like oh this is great this so president trump gets to us congratulations we have a deal and then king salman says we don't have a deal mexico hasn't agreed to their cuts and he's saying what do you mean and so they were part of the opec plus and so i get a note saying you gotta go call mexico so i'm calling mexico we're dealing they're saying we're not doing any cuts so why i said we're hedged to fifty five dollars i said why do you tell us that in the beginning so i'm telling the saudis so we were working through this whole thing so meanwhile we were trying to find the compromise with mexico i set up a call with with trump and putin so they can kinda talk this through and he was always trying to play the game of how do we get russia away from china he always thought that that was not the right strategic framework for us interests and again we had no problems with them during that time what i would say is that for zelensky and putin any conversation with both of them is about understanding their perspective i think with putin he's a a student of history from the things that i i saw with him if you look at russia over the last five hundred years i think they were attacked by the polish in in early sixteen hundred i think they were attacked by the swedes in in the seventeen hundreds i think they were attacked by napoleon in the eighteen hundreds and then in the nineteen hundreds they were attacked by germany twice and so from his perspective there is you know in the early days of russia they were attacked by the mongols they were very vulnerable and a lot of the geography of russia today is really designed for defensive purposes that they have natural barriers that makes them easier to defend and russia is a massive landmass it's it's twice the size of america they have eleven time zones in the country and so i do think that for for vladimir putin his biggest concern is how do we create a security paradigm in the west of his country that won't be a creep and i think that there's like two different parts of the mindset you know the people who are most cynical of putin will say well he's just trying to recreate the ussr he's being expansionist and the people who wanna be sympathetic to him will say well if you think about it the russian perception of the nato arid arrangement was that they wouldn't be expanding westward over the last years they've included all these countries that they said they promised they wouldn't include who knows what the promises were or what or or or were or weren't but what i do know from his perspective is allowing ukraine into nato was always a red line and that's why we never offered it we never provoked it we never brought it up we said we're going to arm him and we basically said just just calm down we don't want any conflicts there we have bigger issues and bigger opportunities to work for him so i do think you have to think through what's a paradigm that he can accept and i do think that you know he'll give the justification for why he's done what he's done and then i think the framework for a solution is about how do we move both parties forward tough job i hope you get the opportunity to do it because i think it's a conversation that will only help the world hopefully find a pathway forward and i should mention because you mentioned geography one of the one of the many books you've recommended to me that gives a very interesting perspective on history it's called prisoners of geography by tim marshall and it has a very interesting perspective on the geopolitical conflicts and perspective of russia from a from a geography perspective and also for china in the second chapter and there's a lot of understanding of why the expansion of nato is such a concern for russia because geography still even in the twenty first century less and less so because of technology and so on but it still plays a major role in conflicts between nations oh okay rivers mountains yeah and understanding the dna of countries it was one of the most phenomenal books and i i just found it on amazon randomly but i i loved every minute of it the chapter on america is also incredible going through the evolution of you know how we became the country we are the different acquisitions the different changes why we have all these geographic advantages and it's it's an unbelievable book for anyone who's interested in geopolitics so i i have to ask on several aspects of china first the president the meeting you helped set up a first call and first meeting between donald trump and xi jinping can you tell the story of that because that's also interesting again that first phone call the reaching out the the forming the human connection which ultimately leads to the connection between nations and the possibility of collaboration so so during the transition president trump took a call from the the head of taiwan and that sent the chinese into a a real tailspin and he didn't do it i think to be provocative to them as much as just as a businessman he felt you answer your call somebody wants to speak to you you speak to them like you you wanna have conversations hear their point of view and but it was taken as a very big insult and it was against tradition and norm and so that was something that set us off in in a wrong direction my view at the time was that you know we are kind of entering a g two world whether people want to admit it or not and that a lot of these countries in what i call the middle market countries were basically playing this when china was being aggressive with their one belt one road they were basically playing us and china against each other and i thought that by the two leaders coming together there were some things they wouldn't agree on but there's a lot that they probably could agree on which could lead to resolutions to a lot of issues in the world that that that was like my most optimistic view my my most more pragmatic view was that president trump had very big issues on trade that he wanted to get to with china you know he felt like china their trade practices were unfair they weren't following all the global rules of trade he was a little bit nervous that they would be provocative with taiwan and i felt like the two of them getting together would be the best way to try and resolve that so the chinese are very proud and a lot of it is about face and so we in order to negotiate for that first call we we basically agreed on what would happen in the call so not let's just have a call say hi nice to meet you it was a question of president trump basically agreed that he would acknowledge the one china policy which he didn't see as a big concession because you could always unacknowledge it the next day so yeah i'll acknowledge it and then we'll go in exchange president xi was gonna come over to the us for a visit so they could sit together and they want to do it outside the white house and so we agreed on mar a lago which i also thought was good because president trump always felt much more comfortable when he was hosting mhmm at his properties and he just felt at home and so he liked having people as his guests and he loved he loved it he always felt really relaxed and and it was great so that was really what we did then the chinese come over very much anticipated visit and it was incredible so they were supposed to sit together for fifteen minutes and they sent about an hour and a half together and during that meeting president trump they said look let's just set some ground rules to this relationship like let's just not talk about taiwan like you know just don't do anything i don't want on the table if it does i'm gonna have to do harsh things mhmm i still want this to be a problem for four years we got bigger issues they basically just again you notice four years of trump administration no taiwan talk whatsoever it was a nonissue started talking about the trade issues they spent a lot of time on north korea president trump was trying to get the perspective from from president xi about north korea because that was again considered from obama the biggest national security issue that we faced at the time and and they just had a good feeling for each other it also helped that you know my wife and i we we actually had a a chinese nanny and teacher in our house and our our kids learned fluent mandarin and our daughter actually opened when president xi and president trump were together with with melania and with madame peng is is my daughter actually sang them a couple of chinese songs and and i thought that was a nice way to show you know we're tough but we respect your culture because the chinese have an incredible culture that goes back thousands of years they're very proud in in how in how they do it and i think that sign of respect also set things off in a very warm way for price jumps say my granddaughter speaks chinese and and we're showing you the respect which i think is very important and he did have respect for them the next part about the visit i mean obviously we had a lot of discussions on trade but the part that was probably most impactful to me was president xi basically did an hour monologue at lunch where he just went through chinese history from his perspective and he talked about with particular emphasis on on kind of the treaty of unequals and then the hundred years of humiliation and then you go through from now all the way to today and you had you know china coming back and rising and you could tell that he was learned the lessons from the past and was very committed to kinda seeing china go through so that was a different time right so china today is different than it was in two thousand seventeen in two thousand seventeen i remember president xi was at davos and he was vetted by all the top business people in the world as the you know donald trump was the threat to the global world order president xi was the champion of free trade and the biggest champion of environmentalism and and and fighting for climate change and and what occurred was president trump came in and basically said like i think china has not been following the rules based order took very very drastic approach with tariffs every time he would do the tariffs again you know i had mnuchin our treasury secretary come to ivanka my house if he does this this is gonna crash the whole economy i mean these and by the way he believed it i mean these were things that people were telling him would be very tough to do you know president trump had a had a gentleman named ambassador lighthizer robert lighthizer he was really the the tip of the spear on all of our our trade negotiations he worked very well with secretary mnuchin and they ended up we ended up increasing tariffs to numbers that hadn't even been thought could happen so we did the first round of tariffs then you know the chinese came back and retaliated very surgically trying to hit us in all the areas that politically would have been difficult and what trump did was instead of backing down he took some of the revenue from the tariffs gave it to the farmers and said i know that this is gonna hurt your business but i'm gonna make sure you guys are made whole and then he doubled down and basically went back at the chinese with even more tariffs so what we watched over a year and a half was probably the biggest hand of poker that was ever played and it was an amazing experience to be a part of it and the role i played was really working for secretary mnuchin and ambassador lighthizer as a as a back channel with the chinese to make sure we can just deescalate things and get to solutions in a in the best way possible and so so anyway it's a a fascinating time but if you think about the global awareness of the the bad practices that china was putting in place today versus what they were in two thousand sixteen i think one of president trump's most successful policies was shifting the way the entire world understood the threat of china and then putting in place the beginning of a regime to try and rebalance the world so that we could have more economic parity so you mentioned to me the book the hundred year marathon by michael pillsbury when we discussed china and i've got a chance to read parts of it and i'd highly recommend people read it because there's a few it's definitely an eye opening perspective i don't know if i agree with all of it i don't know if you agree with all of it but it certainly opens it it gives a very intense perspective on china and you said it was instructive to how you thought how donald trump thought about china can you describe the main thesis of the book and maybe with the hopeful view how it's possible to have a trajectory of these two superpowers working together in the twenty first century versus fighting against each other perfect so it's a very very big book and i i i think it's a book definitely worth reading michael is is is is tremendous he speaks fluent mandarin and so he he spent a lot of time researching to do the book so i highly recommend it to everyone and it was considered more of a fringe perspective in two thousand sixteen but it really i think came to represent the underpinning of what the collective thought was of the trump administration and and maybe you could argue that it was even more cynical the the whole thesis of the book was that china from nineteen forty nine to two thousand forty nine was working to reclaim their position as the global leader right so you had the the chinese empire you know one of the things i don't know if it's from this book or a different book that i read that spoke about how in in the late seventeen hundreds basically the emperor of china was offered some of the industrial capability from england which was basically now becoming an industrial the industrial revolution and basically no we're fine we're the great chinese empire we don't we don't need any of these things we're we're better than that and by rejecting that the rest of the world got stronger china remained weaker then you had the the the the opium wars you know the the chinese had big opium problems through all the trade back and forth and then china from about eighteen forty to to the nineteen forty at a hundred years where they really after all these treaties were really a a second class country and so then you have the people's revolution that comes in and he talks about how china very strategically is a very very poor country you know would fight their way back and and build brick by brick and you know he proffers in the book that nixon didn't go to china and open china it was china that actually went to nixon and was able to use nixon in order to open up and then they talk about how under carter they were able to get the us to contribute to a lot of their they were able to kind of start borrowing the us know how from our university systems from our medical from our science from our research and the whole notion that was the conventional thinking of american leaders was that the more we help china advance the more they would become a free market economy and and it was a great market the only difference was was that they weren't allowing us access they were making our companies basically give them all of their technical knowledge they were stealing our intellectual property they were doing espionage to to steal a lot of the patents they were just ignoring our patents and they weren't following any of the rules of international trade then they started becoming the world's manufacturing hub they basically became the world's factory and then they started this whole initiative called the belt and road initiative in order to start locking in their lines of trades they were buying up all the ports everywhere they were building railways thinking how do we we lock in our distribution so that we can maintain the dominance as the world's global factory and so it was a brilliant long term plan that they were doing and by raising awareness by putting the tariffs trump slowed them down a lot the real question is is if they actually did achieve this full objective of becoming the world dominant country what they would have done with it whether they would have been nefarious or not i think from my perspective even with some of the divisions and issues we have now in america i still would rather but the notion was is that they were playing a very zero sum game and really going to be the dominant leader in this new world order so so that really framed the perspective and it wasn't necessarily you know people ask me was was and the chinese were always fearing is trump trying to stop our eyes right and you have a great book also by graham allison that he writes about you know are we destined for war between us and china and he goes through different historical times where you have a power and a rising superpower and i think you know more than half the time it ends up leading to war so the question is is what's gonna happen here and i i do think that trump's perspective and this is my interpretation because everything was always tactical day to day and you know he was unpredictable to the chinese which they couldn't deal with and he was unpredictable even to his team sometimes because he was playing it day by day and issue by issue and always changing and adjusting which is how an entrepreneur thinks he respected the job they did by building their country they moved three hundred million people out of poverty into the middle class they did it at the expense of a lot of other countries throughout the world especially america but trump says look stupid politicians made deals i respect china for doing what they did but what i wanna do is i wanna change the paradigm so that for the next twenty years we can maintain our advantage over them we can maintain our competitive dynamic and you know his general view was that america is the best private sector in the world we have a lot of the best minds in the world and if we could just have a level playing field with set rules then america should be able to outperform and so that's really what we were trying to do we were trying to kind of get rid of some of their state subsidies get rid of make them follow some of these international rules of trade and and not allowing them to do predatory investments that then undercut different industries that we had so that they can have global market dominance or monopolies on different industries and then have pricing power but also you know geopolitical powers like one of the examples that people talk about now is china for the last twenty years was very advanced on seeing this electrification trend they went they they they subsidized solar panels a lot of the american solar panel players were put out of business so now i think it's like ninety plus percent of solar panels in the world are manufactured in china then all the rare earths that you need in order to make these solar panels and to make these electric vehicles china's bought up most of them and a lot of the refining capacities in china so thinking through strategically how do we create an even playing field so that we're not at the mercy of them and how you can have a a rules based world order that was really kind of the thought of what we were trying to work towards so there's this snl skit where jimmy fallon plays you and you're walking into the oval office looking cool wearing wearing shades and a bulletproof vest to the song unbelievable by emf i don't know if you've seen it but it's pretty epic and then trump says that you've traveled the world representing the administration but no one has ever heard you speak so there's a lot of questions i can ask about that clip but one of them is can you introspect why you choose this low key approach of kind of operating behind the scenes and not speaking much to the public at least at the time you've you've you've spoken a little bit more and today you've spoken for a really long time which i deeply appreciate oh it's been a pleasure to do this and and thank you for the opportunity to to talk about these things and as so so that was a really funny skit and you know it's funny the the the thing i got made fun of the most for that was the wardrobe and that came from after you know three months in the administration we would have we're having dinner with all the generals and they were saying you know updating us on the war with isis and general dunford said to me after look the president can't come to see how we're fighting this war but i'd like to invite you to come with me to iraq and come see and would you come with me i said you know what that's great i always learned in business that you can't make decisions from just an ivory tower you have to go to the front lines and see what what's actually happening so i said no problem i i'd love to go meanwhile two days before i'm about to go the doc from the white house stops by my office and says we need to get your blood types what do you mean my blood type is you're going to an active war zone i'm like okay so i i guess i'll go to a war zone i i didn't really think this thing fully through so i get on the plane with dunford and we land in in iraq and he looks like gi joe he's you know he's a great great general he's very very well respected in the military and we we go in and we we get on blackhawk helicopter they said you know what today's a nice day let's take the the sides off and so i get on the plane and there's a guy you know military service officer who then takes a machine gun locks it into a thing takes the bullets puts them into the gun and it's sitting there saying we're ready to go and then i'm looking out and there's like three other helicopters with guys one was an osprey with a guy buckled in also with a machine gun looking out we take off and we're flying over baghdad from the airport to the embassy and as we're going i was sitting in an open air helicopter with the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff guys with machine guns everywhere this is a new experience for you you have an experience for you i would say yes i mean i was doing real estate like three months ago you know and now i'm flying over iraq and yeah and the chairman says that's saddam hussein's palace and i looked down there's like a big bomb right through the middle then you see the area with the two swords in the hands i'm saying to myself like how the hell did i get here like what what what is happening so meanwhile we end up going to the front lines to be with the service the iraqi military which the us military is working closely with and i had a meeting that night with the president of iraq and so i wore what do you wear to the front lines in a battle zone and and also me or the president so i put a sport jacket on we land at the at the front line and they give me a bulletproof vest that says kushner on it i tape it i just i i put it on i go out and it covered the ner so it just said kush kush yeah and and i went and i didn't realize they were taking pictures and so i think the picture looks pretty epic you with sunglasses i think i love it so anyway so that was the funny story behind that and then actually my brother was at some society event in new york and he ran into jimmy fallon so the two of them took a selfie together and josh writes me says hanging out with my older brother in new york yeah you know i'm i'm trying to explain to him what your voice sounds like so so it was good so that was a funny one but i think just being behind the scenes for me just gave me more maneuverability in the sense that you know again it goes back to trust and people knowing that i wasn't gonna try to publicize the things they were telling me i think it just gave me more ability to operate that way and i also realized too like communicating is a very important skill luckily in washington there's no shortage of amazing communicators i think there were a lot of people who are much better at me than being communicators so i was very happy that they were willing to do it because it wasn't something that i had a lot of experience with or necessarily i thought was very i was very good at and so i kinda just did my job and and and just focused on getting things done so let me let me ask you you have a very interesting life if you were to give advice to young folks on how to have such an impactful life what would you say career and life how to have a successful career and a successful life number one is i would say you just have to work hard at everything you do number two i would say never stop learning and always try to say yes more than you should go out of your comfort zone and i think just just you gotta work hard at everything you do and and and if you're gonna take something on do it the best you can you know one of the lessons i write about in the book from my father was i remember i was going for a job interview and he asked me he says well what time are you leaving to the job interview is it nine o'clock i said i'll leave at eight o'clock he said well what if there's traffic i said dad i've done this drive a thousand times like there's never traffic so what if there's an accident i said i can't control that he said jared the only excuse you ever have for being late is that you didn't leave early enough and i just think it's something where if you wanna accomplish something you know a lot of people i hear they complain about what other people do or why it's hard or why it's impossible and again i say this as somebody who's been so blessed with with with so many things in life but you know when i've had challenges or things i've wanted to achieve i just focus and say what what can i do and i'll i'll i'll read everything i i can get my hands on i'll i'll if i fail at one the door closes i'll try the window if the window closed i'll try the chimney if the chimney trills i'll try to dig a tunnel it's just if you want to accomplish something you just have to go at it and you know i think the the most important thing i'll say sorry i'm kinda thinking my way into this answer is is just do the right thing i i think that's also right and i saw that in my career you know be good to people be honest do the right thing and and if you do that i think long term it does pay off maybe not in politics but in in the world at large it does and my hope is in politics it will as well i wonder if you can comment on your process of learning in general because you took on so many new interesting problems and approached them with a first principles kind of approach mhmm so what was your source of information so because you didn't seem to be listening to the assumptions of the prior experts you were just taking on the problem in a very pragmatic perspective so what was how'd you learn about the middle east how did you learn about china how did you learn about mexico how did you you know like all of these prison reform all of this that you've taken on and were extremely effective at it really started with just talking to people i i would i would try to reach out to people who had been involved in different things and ask them you know what they did what they thought of the problem who they thought was smart on it what they read that helped them get a better understanding why they think something had failed and then i would just you know read voraciously on every topic you know washington it was harder to get advice from from humans because i found humans had this weird tendency to talk to the media and so you know i talked to somebody and i'd ask advice and then the next thing i know is the washington post would call and say jared's an idiot doesn't know what he's doing and he's even going to this person to get advice i'm like yeah i'm asking everyone so so books really became an amazing guide for me ivanka she she's an incredible researcher she she's just voracious and so she gave me some of my best books and some incredible advice as well but that was really the the process and then i think that was kind of the first stage and then the second stage was just constant iteration and readjusting plan as you continue to get more learning and one story i tell in the book as well is that on my my first trip to the middle east where i met with mohammed bin zayed who i spoke about earlier the ruler of uae i spent two hours with him asking him questions and really going through the israeli palestinian issue the israeli arab issue and he said to me at the end of the meeting he says jared i think you're gonna make peace here in the middle east and i was shocked because i mean first of all he was you know at the time i think some one of the most respected leaders in the region somebody who i found to be very wise and super thoughtful and experienced and i said to him why do you say that i was flattered obviously but but not certain why he was saying that based on the fact that i didn't know what my plan was i didn't know what i was gonna do and i had no pathway to make peace and he said well the us usually sends one of three different kinds of people to come see me he says the first are people who come and they fall asleep in meetings he said the second are people who come and they basically read me notes but have no ability to interact on the message they're there to convey and then the third have been people who have come to convince me to do things that aren't in my interests he says you're the first person who's ever come here and it's just asked questions he says why why have you done that i said because i figured you know this problem has been going on for a long time you live here i'll be gone at some point you're gonna have to live with the consequences of whatever my work is and the us has a lot of power and my question is what would you do if you were me and how would you approach this and help me think about it and again i wasn't gonna then take his plan and then execute it but i thought it'd be very provocative to understand from the people in the region and instructive how they would use the resource and the power that the us had to solve the problems that were having significant impact on their lives yeah there's a lot of power to the sort of the the simplicity of that human approach where you're just listening yeah and one of my wishes for society is i i leave government you know i was living on the upper east side in a very liberal echo chamber i then traveled the country i met so many people who i never would have met otherwise on the conservative side on the independent side on so many different issues i think that people benefit if you have such a strong point of view i would follow you know the john stuart mill marketplace of ideas mhmm and find people who disagree with you and don't call them names don't say they're a bad person say i wanna understand why you feel the way you do let's have conversations in this country mhmm and i think that that's probably gonna be our best way to work through the issues that we have currently when you zoom out and look at the twenty first century from a human history perspective across the time scale of many decades maybe centuries what gives you hope about human civilization everything you've seen you've traveled the world you've talked to some of the most powerful and influential people and you look at the future what gives you hope about this little planet of ours what gives me the most hope is that anything's possible if there's there's one lesson that i took from my time in government it's that people coming together to try to make tomorrow different than yesterday can succeed and if the right people in the right places focus on the right ideas i think the advancement that we can have for human history and for society can be tremendous and i think that right now i see we're at a place in society where there's a lot of what i call squabbles between countries which are really man versus man issues and those are as old as time right you know we've been been fighting about borders or or or religion or you know or or who wronged somebody a hundred or a thousand years ago and these are what i call more tribal battles but i do think that as we advance with artificial intelligence as energy becomes cheaper and it's more readily available i think we're gonna have massive industrialization i think we're gonna have massive advancement i think in medical and science we're gonna have cures for diseases we have the potential in ten twenty years from now to enter a dawn for humanity that could be incredible we could become multiplanetary we can we can explore the wonders of the world we can find things we didn't know so i think that if if we we put our energy towards finding these advancements that will improve the lives of of everyone on this planet instead of figuring out ways to have these tensions between us that for me is the most optimistic case for what's possible and the reason why i believe it's possible is because somebody with no experience somebody who all i really had was was the faith of of a leader and i had the the courage to try and i went out there with other people and we took on some of the most hopeless impossible problems and we succeeded and if we were able to do that then everyone else should be able to do that as well well jared thank you for having the courage to try thank you for your friendship for your kindness most importantly for your book recommendations and thank you for talking today this was fascinating eye opening i hope to have many more conversations like this thank you very much lex thank you for
