here's randall kennedy you wrote a book whose title is the n word spelled out with a hard r at the end so let's start with the history of this word what is the history of the n word the word you're referring to is nigger the book that you're referring to is nigger the strange career of a troublesome word the word dates back to the sixteenth seventeenth century it's got a long lineage in other words basically latin basically spanish basically n i g you know black in various formulations we don't know actually how the term nigger became a slur so there were words that were close to n i g g e r that were used in various ways for instance n i g g u h has been was used n i g g u r is used and sometimes it was used in a way that seemed to be just purely descriptive we do know that by the early nineteenth century it had become a slur it had become a derogatory word about which people complained but exactly how that came about not altogether clear so it's been twenty years since you've written the book what have you what wisdom have you gained about this word since writing the book and maybe having to interact with people having to read having to see having to feel the response to the book this book has generated a lot of controversy i i thought it would it's probably generated more controversy than i had anticipated it has certainly generated more more different sorts of experiences than i had anticipated so for instance i did not think that writing this book would prompt people to ask me to be an expert witness in cases and over the past twenty years i've been an expert witness in a number of different cases i've been an expert witness in case in in a murder case in various cases of of assault i've been an expert witness in cases involving tort cases intentional infliction of emotional distress i've been an expert witness in a number of employment cases i i i had not anticipated that nor had i anticipated the extent to which people would get in trouble for using my book every year there are teachers who are suspended or who are fired because they will exert a chapter of my book let's let's imagine a and this is not i'm not imagining things this has happened a teacher is teaching for instance the mark twain's huckleberry finn the word nigger appears in that book over two hundred times the teacher trying to be earnest trying to be sensible trying to be serious will exert a part of my book to acquaint students with the history of the word and maybe the history of controversy involving the use of the word in this particular novel the stew you know the teacher will give it out hand it out to the teachers hand it out to students and there have been a number of teachers who've been suspended or worse because of that teach students will get upset go home tell their parents their parents will storm to the school and say that this is you know this is terrible the teacher is quote using the word nigger in an offensive way and oftentimes administrators will basically abandon the the the teacher and this when whenever this comes to my attention i write i i will write the you know superintendent of schools or i'll write the principal or sometimes i'll you know i'll write a an opinion editorial piece for the local newspaper but every year there are teachers who are disciplined for using my book i had not i had not anticipated that and what is the nature of the letter or the or the op ed that you write on why they shouldn't be disciplined or if they to like to the degree they should be or shouldn't be there's there has not been one case there's not been one case that has come to my attention in which it was even remotely sensible for the teacher to be disciplined and what i say is that number one frankly i go through it's the what i write is almost a a synopsis of my book number one this is an important word in american history it is a word that is explosive that's why people get so upset it's a word that's volatile it's a word that has typically has typically been used in a terrible way it's a word that is part of the soundtrack of racial terrorism in the united states so people ought to know about this word i mean if you're interested in knowing the real history of the united states if you're interested in knowing about lynching if you're interested in knowing about the way in which black people have been terrorized in the united states you need to know this word you need to know that history so you need to know why it is that people are upset about the word but that's not but it doesn't end there you have to know that and if you know that then that knowledge should equip you to be careful it should equip you to know that you know to know to know the the the the range of context in which this word appears but again it doesn't just end there because especially young people you tell that to young people they nod they read they spotify they listen to their some of their favorite entertainers they listen to doctor dre they listen to the ghetto boys they listen to you know snoop and they listen to nwa what do they hear they they they they they listen to stand up comedians they listen to dave chappelle they listen to katt williams they you know what do they hear they hear the word nigger or nigger being used in a lot of different ways and so they need to know about that as well what are people doing what do how does one explain the fact that dick gregory dick gregory was a comedian activist friend of martin luther king junior a true activist i mean he had a very he had a flourishing career as an entertainer that he abandons in order to struggle for racial justice throughout the united states and in including the deep south how does one explain the fact that the he he wrote several memoirs but his first memoir is called nigger a memoir how does one explain that how does one explain the way in which how does one explain richard pryor i mean richard pryor's best album is that nigger's crazy well was richard pryor trying to put down black people how does one explain that one can only explain that by getting deeper into the word by understanding that yes this is a word that has been used in a derogatory way this has been this is a word that has been used to put people down this has been this is a word that has been used to terrorize people you gotta know that but you also have to know that this is a word that has also been put to other uses there are artists there are entertainers who have used this word like de greg de gregory used it to put up a mirror to american society and say look at this word and look at the terrible way in which it's been used we don't want you to look away no don't look away we're not no no euphemism no asterisk no no n word no nigger now we want you to look at that and we wanna talk about that james baldwin james ball there was a there was a documentary about james baldwin couple years ago highly lauded documentary the title that was given to this documentary was i am not your negro that's not what james baldwin said anybody can took go to youtube right now take a look james baldwin said i am not your nigger and then he went on to talk about that well you know james baldwin wasn't again he he wasn't starting to cover up anything he wanted people to face the facts of american life and it seems to me that if you're a teacher and you want to have your students face the facts about american life well you've got to grapple with the word nigger now let me just quickly say you know teachers have a tough job and if we're talking about students of course there's a wide range of students am i saying that one ought to give my book to kindergartners no you know kindergartners are probably not ready for such a book third graders probably no not third grade if we're talking however about people in the tenth grade do i think the tenth graders can read my book yeah sure absolutely eleventh graders twelfth graders people in college there are people in college there are people in there are people in law schools teachers in law schools have been disciplined for because the word nigger has come out of a teacher's mouth why in a couple of cases recently teacher would be reading a a court opinion the word appears in the court opinion the teacher pronounces the word you know students get up leave in a huff report to teacher there's some instances in which teachers have been under those circumstances have been disciplined in my view that's bad and people ought to say it's bad it's bad pedagogically and frankly in many of these instances it's not only bad it's stupid and i don't mind saying that i think that some of these instances in which teachers have been disciplined absolutely stupid people say well the teacher used the word excuse me used the word it'd be one thing it'd be one thing if a teacher looked at a student and called the student nigger you know get out of here nigger that'd be one that'd be you know fine discipline that's teacher that's that's bad but that's not what's going on you don't have these these none of these are cases in which you have an individual who is a stranger to another individual and this word just sort of comes out no what we have here is a class involving a person who is a teacher interacting with students talking about subjects in which it would be perfectly understandable why this word would emerge as a subject of conversation now under those circumstances it's somehow wrong for a teacher to you to to utter this word in my view the answer is no and you know i said that twenty years ago i say i say it even more emphatically now still it is one of the most powerful words in the english language mhmm and there's a kind of responsibility that we as humans should have with words yes with statements that word if not used skillfully if not used competently even when just read from a legal transcript can do more more harm than good i agree with what you say yes words are powerful words do matter and so i am certainly not suggesting that people be lax i'm not suggesting that people be irresponsible it's precisely because words matter however that we need to be willing to face words and grapple with words and talk about words and talk about the history of words precisely because words matter and among other things it seems to me it's important to understand that words can mean different things in different contexts it's not the case that a word means the same thing in every context the word discriminating sometimes it's a very bad thing that person discriminates and when you you know again you know intonation of voice means something if i say that person discriminates and i'm obviously being disapproving implicitly what i'm saying is that person distinguishes between things on an unjustifiable basis and that's a bad thing on the other hand that person has discriminating taste oh that means something very different that means that the person differentiates in a way that shows that they understand the difference between excellent good and not so good and we think that that's a good thing so words can have different you know words can mean different things in different contexts it seems to me that that's something that actually we ought to recognize we ought to recognize and talk about well some words enter this territory of being a slur and it seems like when they cross the line into being a slur the there's the number of context in which it's okay to mention it exponentially decreases right no no i'm gonna no i'm gonna resist that a little bit because the whole idea of you know slurs slurs change yankee was a slur yankee was a slur in you know eighteenth century united states mhmm slur today you know new york yankees i'm a yankee fan i'm a yankee queer queer you know you know and then this is in in in in my lifetime there was a time you know that you queer and people would really run away from it and that was you know a bad thing and then thank goodness gay liberation movement gay liberation movement basically we're not gonna run away from this we're gonna grab this quote slur and we're going to affix it to ourselves and we are going to repurpose it now the word queer is again you know can it be a slur yeah it can be a slur doesn't have to be and it seems to me that it's important for people to know about how a word a symbol in some context can be a slur in some context doesn't have to be so the whole idea of you know what's a slur that could that's a that's a complicated idea in and of itself it's very complicated it's if i may say almost fascinating how language evolves mhmm but if we were to kind of have a minute by minute evaluation of the most powerful intensely slur like words in the world i think the n word with a hard r at the end which is the title of your book is number one on that list well i probably so and of course that's one of the reasons why i wrote a little book about it yeah but it hasn't even since you wrote a little book about it it seems like it's maintained its number one status you mentioned queer mhmm it maybe queer was in the top twenty i don't know for a while and now it's sliding into the top thousand and n the n word is at the top you're absolutely right the origins of this book i i clearly remember i was i was at my office and i was thinking about lecture topics and i get invited to give lectures from time to time and i was thinking well you know what what what might make for an interesting lecture and all of a sudden the word nigger popped into my mind now this is a word i've i've grown up with this word i mean there's there's there's never been a time in my life when at least in my conscious life the in which i've in which this word's been absent i mean in in my household for instance in my household my parents are black people my parents were refugees from the jim crow south i was born in the deep south south carolina in my household i heard the word nigger used in every possible way i heard it used as a slur i also heard it used with respect to people who were praised you know my father i clearly remember my father whom i revere that's the smartest nigga in the world that's the bravest nigga in the world that's the baddest nigga i know it was he he wasn't putting people down this is the way he talked and i grew up hearing this word in various ways and so i was thinking to myself god where did this word come from and one of the first things i did i clearly remember just jumping up out of my seat running up to the library oxford english dictionary when did this word first appear in english was the history of the word and then what really sort of grabbed my attention is i went i i i i get my computer going and i asked the computer system give me every case every federal court case in which this word appears thousands of cases and then i said oh my goodness this is real and then you know this is really interesting and then i started just cataloging all the you know different cases there came a point i'd say probably about a month into this i compared the usage i compared the number of times nigger came up with other sorts of slurs so for instance kike k i k e long time you know you know derogatory word for jews how many times does this word come up there was a time in where when in which the word appeared but nothing like the infamous n word nothing and then i you know what about wetback what about and then i just you know let me let me just take a look at all the other slurs nothing came close not even remotely close to nigger and i think it has something to do with i think it has something to do with the uniqueness of the color line particularly as it pertains to african americans i think that the the fact that nigger sort of occupies such a unique status among slurs i think that's a reflection of the unique stigma that has been imposed on african americans it's hard to know the chicken or the egg why one word is able to so distinctly and clearly encapsulate this struggle between races that is throughout american history i mean they didn't have to probably be so but it came to be that way it became that and not only that not only that but of course the nigger spurred other slurs so arabs sand niggers the irish the niggers of europe women the niggers of the world john lennon even has a song that's right well i think yoko ono i think had something to do with that song so i mean it is a slur that has spawned other slurs and again this is that's why you know as you indicated a moment ago this is a quite unique term but are you conscious are you deliberate in you saying this word so let me just say from a personal experience maybe my upbringing where i came from in my daily life i don't think i've ever heard that word with a hard r said as often used clearly in my life said that i've heard it today more than i have ever heard in my entire life and i think there's a a few people who listen to this they'll be listening to this and be very uncomfortable mhmm i would say not in a bad way probably in a good way i'm uncomfortable now and i am almost introspecting and trying to figure out why am i uncomfortable and i think even the title of your book is making me think that mhmm just just looking into my own mind and trying to understand wow words of power and why does it have so much power but are you deliberate in that action and by the way not only are the people listening to this sweating this will be on youtube mhmm in part and youtube the people on the other side will be sweating what do we do with this yeah well am i deliberate yeah the answer is yes and let me let me unpack that a little bit first that's right i mean am i deliberate yeah what is that i deliberately wrote a book called nigger the strange career of a troublesome word and you know was that deliberate yeah that was quite deliberate but the title could have been n word versus the the title could have been n word sure the title could have been n word the title could have been a book about a word that causes pain to many people i could have named it that there are many there are many titles i could have used did i want a title that would be provocative did i want a title that would grab people the answer to that is yes what do you know i'm i'm a writer i want people to read what i write what was i being sensationalistic well i mean if you if if you wanna put it like that yes i don't i don't i'm not embarrassed to say that i mean i'm sure that when people write books they think really hard about their titles and they try to get a title that will you know grab people's attention i know people respect people very deeply who never it's a matter of principle never utter this word and i've talked with people i've had people say you know i read your book let's talk about it but let's be very clear i'm not gonna use the word i've had many conversations with people who've asked me not to use the word i was on a i was on a the the first time this came up was a book tour it was twenty years ago when the first book first came out and i was on one of these call in shows early in the morning time came to call in seven o'clock i call in at five zero seven right before i go on the host of the show says oh by the way we have a strict policy here at the station we never use this word and i said well gosh i wish you had told me this earlier does this mean then that you're never going to pronounce fully the title of my book and she said that's right and i had to make a choice right then and there am i gonna go on or am i not what'd you do i went on and i abided by the station's rules and you know fine we had a perfectly fine conversation and you know i there is a place for euphemism the american language is a very subtle language there are lots of words that one can use i do not get angry with people who don't you know they say as a matter of principle they're not gonna use the word fine i i'm willing to i understand where they're coming from and often i will defer to their wishes all i say is i want people to understand where i'm coming from i'm not just using this word willy nilly there's a pedagogical reason there is a reason for why i'm saying what i'm saying there is a reason why i use the word can you make the case why using the word is a good idea and can you make can you steal man the case why it's a bad idea maybe you've heard from some critics yes who said that you saying this word out loud is actually causing a lot of harm not like harm because people's feelings are hurt but increasing the amount of racism and hate in the world yeah critics let's start with the critics sure one again going back to the when the when the book was first published i remember going to the first bookstore i went to and i talked about the book had a very you know talked asked questions and the last comment wasn't a question but the last comment was made by an elderly black man i called on him and he said i've listened to what you've had to say and i appreciate what you've had to say but he he said but i remain unconvinced and i remain unconvinced because when i was coming up this word was used to put me in the back of the bus and this word was used to prevent me from voting and this was the word that was used to justify me never being called as a juror so to me this word has only one meaning it's a terrible meaning i'm never going to use the word it hurts me when i hear people use the word especially those who don't know anything about the you know really about the history of it and he went on to say i think that your book though well intended is probably going to be seen by some people as giving them permission to use the word and then he stopped and i thought there was a lot of power behind that gentleman's con comment i think that what he said is probably correct and so far as there are probably some people who read the you know read the book there are probably some people who are listening to our conversation right now who will think that i'm giving people permission to use the word you know i have said that i'm i'm not i want people to understand the word i think that there is a burden that comes from whenever you know whenever you utter a word like this but that's you know that's a critique and i think there's i think there's strength to that critique i'm not gonna say that that's a ridiculous critique i think that there is something to that and by the way i should say and that's why i would say to anyone that's right if this word comes out of your mouth you are taking on real responsibility so for years it doesn't happen so much now but they were i'd say for about the first five years after this book was published i would get an email at least once a week mhmm and it would begin like this you know dear professor kennedy i read your book and i'm calling to ask you a question and as soon as i saw that i knew what the question was gonna be and it would what what the person would say is the following i like rap and then i knew i knew what was coming i like rap i'm white and i have black friends and we listen to rap and we're you know we're driving in the car and we're you know we're we're listening to the song we starts you know we start humming along and sing a singing along and my black friends sing along and when nigger or nigga comes up they sing and i don't know what to do is it wrong for me to sing along this happened so often that i'd say about after about the tenth time i got in such an email i wrote a form letter because i didn't wanna just you know take up time writing you know let you know sort of crafting letter after letter after letter so i wrote a form letter and basically what i said was listen number one you know i'm flattered that you're asking me but number one you you you should have a conversation with your friend number two no matter what your friend says let me put something else for you to consider let's suppose for the sake of discussion that your friend says oh doesn't bother me i know where you're coming from we're just enjoying the music i don't think that this is you know a racist utterance you know coming out of your mouth let's suppose that your friend says that that doesn't end matters because let's imagine the following let's imagine that you're in a a theater and you're waiting for the you know film to start and you're just you know talking with your friends or singing with your friends or just you know kicking back with your friends and they're talking about nigger this or nigger this and you say it you the white boy say it and the next thing you feel is a fist a big fist in your mouth that has been launched by a person that you did not see who was right behind you mhmm all this person saw was a white person saying nigga and the next thing pow mhmm that's not you know some sort of overheated scenario coming from some law professor's mind that is a very plausible scenario so you have to be worried about lots of things including mistake so my advice to you my is be prudent i would stay clear of the word unless unless you're very certain and unless if you're called on it you feel you're in a position to defend yourself defend what you're doing but the prudent thing would be to stay clear there's so many questions i wanna ask there one is about the violence and the legal aspect of that it's very interesting you raised that in the book but you know i do wanna bring up something i probably disagree with you on which is you say that there's not a significant difference between the different variations of the n word mhmm the one the or maybe maybe you don't i just listened to a bunch of your interviews so there's the the version with the e r at the end mhmm version with a g a at the end mhmm and then g r o at the end these are all different versions and i feel like in that list of powerful words you know i feel like there's a distinction yes i feel like the number one spot is the one with the hard r mhmm and i don't know maybe you can try to shed light but i feel like the one that ends in ga is really far down the list in terms of modern culture so this is we talked about the evolution of the words and the word queer for example it feels like because maybe because of rap because of comedians because it's become much more it lost so much of its power well oh you don't think so no i think there's a difference between nigger and nigger i mean people make a distinction between them and i think that to the extent that lots of people make a distinction between them i think you know just as a sociological fact they are different i think that people who get upset if somebody especially white people so you know if if a white person says nigga and they're you know and and they and they're you know sort of criticized about it and they say well i didn't say nigger i said nigger i believe me i think most you know most people who are mad at them are gonna stay mad at them now you you raised the word you know so nigger and nigger i would put in a very different category than negro educate me here well yeah sure happy to negro is a also controversial it's also controversial but negro has never been viewed by a substantial number of people as a derogatory term at least in the in with with the same amount of animus the same amount of it's it's it's it's a very different kind of word than nigger or nigger i mean after all i mean you know negro martin luther king junior you know you know all of his great oratory negro you read the work of you know dub the great w e b du bois negro you read the work of my boss so so for instance i use the word negro i use african american black afro american but i also use the word negro now there are some people who get really mad at me because of you know when i use the word negro and then so for instance there's students who've gotten really quite exercise and they'll say you know i'll be giving a lecture and you know a hand will go up i'll call on somebody and they'll say listen are you using the word negro in its purely because of the historical time period that you're using so you you know is is that why you're using it or are you using it in your own voice and often i'll say well i'm using it in my own voice and i'll say well i'm offended we think that this is you know that's old timey it's derogatory when this first came up i i said let's pause for a moment and i'll take that under advisement and let me let me look into this mhmm and i ended up writing an essay about it an essay about the history of the terms that black people have used to describe themselves and it's a long list you know black colored afro american african american negro etcetera so i go through all that and i said now let me just tell you i know for certain when i started using the word negro often in in writing i can date it nineteen eighty three the summer of nineteen eighty three is when i started using the word negro in my professional life as a lawyer and i did it for a very specific reason i did it because my boss demanded that i negro capital n now who was my boss my boss in the summer of nineteen eighty three was associate justice of the united states supreme court thurgood marshall known as mister civil rights now it seems to me you're telling me that this word is so out of bounds that this word is derogatory nobody should ever use this word does the fact that thurgood marshall demanded that i use this word does that complicate things a little bit and so i think that people again you know ought to know more i mean i've i've encountered students who don't know very much but who want to lecture me yeah on on word usage because they know you know three sentences about current fashion and hold it you know hold it by the way i i push it further i sometimes use the word colored and then you know some people really don't like that color well you know there's there's a there's an organization still very much alive in american life and law the national association for the advancement of colored people the naacp they they haven't changed their name and as far as i'm concerned it's a wonderful organization there are people who have used the word colored that's what my grandmother used colored perfectly fine as far as i'm concerned so again we there there are lots of different words to that one can use you can use different formulations i understand that people have different preferences fine i have my preferences at least know where i'm coming from still words have power and they have power to hurt mhmm and there's there's a lot of reasons that i could see to justify the use of the word in its full form as you're saying when in this conversation as you're using it one of them is perhaps fighting for the freedom to be able to use those kinds of words so let me ask you about freedom of speech mhmm and the censorship of the word should the use of the and word be censored for example on social networks so we we can come up with different places we can say university campuses maybe in op eds or i don't know but i think social networks currently is a very interesting place mhmm there's a lot of conversations that are happening on them there's the ability the technical capability to sentence to remove the ability of people to use the word do you think they should be allowed to use the word on twitter for example mhmm my response is it all depends on the way in which the word is being used if the word is being used to intimidate if the word is being used to terrorize then no along with lots of other words by the way i mean you can have you could i could use the word i suppose gentlemen i mean i'm sure that i could conjure up a way in which that word could be used in a you know intimidating way so i'm i'm should would i be happy if there was a technology that always blanked this word n i g g e r i'm a be i would be against that for one thing it would erase the name of one of my books and i'm i think you know and i'm i think that the book actually has a lot of useful information and makes some useful points if and by the way if let's imagine let's imagine a world in which there was a technology that blanked every time n i g g e r appeared you would have what would that do to novels by james baldwin by toni morrison by what would that do to the speeches of malcolm x martin luther king junior what would that do to the comedy albums of richard pryor katt williams dave chappelle you know what would that if if one sort of plays that out would one want to have all of those blanks in important literary and political performances no i don't want such blanks what i want i would want for peep i would want the word to be there and for people to understand how to deal with this word and by the way you've used the word hurt an awful lot so let's talk about hurt i think we need to be more careful with the way in which we deal with hurt because people can be justifiably hurt you can have justifiably hurt feelings and if somebody has justifiably hurt feelings i then think that we should turn to the person who has hurt those feelings and say you have acted wrongly because this person's feelings are justifiably hurt in relationship to what you've done on the other hand there are people who have hurt feelings and frankly it's unjustified so just just imagine the following let's let's imagine that i give a talk about the greatness of martin luther king junior and then let's imagine that a ku klux klansman comes up to me after my talk and says oh you have now hurt my feelings what am i supposed to be am i supposed to apologize am i supposed to be regretful that my talk about the greatness of martin luther king junior has hurt the feelings of the klansmen no my response is gonna be you know you need to reevaluate your feelings because actually you your feeling of hurt is unjustified and no i'm you know no there's no apology coming from me but there there's a kind of line and perhaps the gray area and maybe the word hurt has been overused because if you try to avoid hurting a small fraction of society that is mentally weak in a way where everything hurts them that's that's the wrong way to build a society mhmm but if we flip that upside down and say trying to maximize the amount of love in the world and think about decisions we make in terms of language we use to try to maximize the amount of love and not just short term but long term k and that's where freedom of speech is very powerful because it's a short term painful thing often but long term beneficial thing just having freedom and so there's where the question of the n word starts to come in how much how do we think about its use on the internet on college campuses in a way that maximizes the amount of love and compassion and camaraderie in the world i think that's good and i'm you know i would associate myself with your vision how can we how can we maximize love no i love that i i i think that's great so let's let's let's take that on i doubt that the way of doing that is to erase the infamous n word i doubt that the way of doing that is to say to people we understand that your feelings are really hurt and we're gonna do all that we can to avoid this symbolic action you know maybe this word or maybe this symbol we we're we're gonna really we're gonna do all that we can to suppress it so that we can have a more loving universe i doubt that that's the way to do it i think a better way to do it i think a a better way to do it would be to fully educate people including educate people such that you see that over there that is the uniform of the ku klux klan i want you to be educated about the uniform of the ku klux klan so that you can look at the uniform of the ku klux klan and know what it's about you're not terrorized by it you're not immediately you're not you know you you don't see it and sink to your knees and start wailing and crying you don't see it and say i'm traumatized no you don't do any of that you see it you understand it if somebody asks you about it you're fully prepared to talk about it seems to me that that attitude that poise that strength that knowledge would be a better way of equipping us to have a more loving world and by the way just so you know i would say that about the swastika i would say it about the infamous n word i would say it about all of the things that we're talking about it would be better for people to be educated so that they are not traumatized so do you you know the n word should not be removed from huck finn adventures of huck finn or from the works of james baldwin and tony morrison not at all in fact it seems to me that the the polarization of of of of these great artists' literary you know work is as far as i'm concerned highly objectionable highly objectionable when is it okay for a white man to say the n word with a hard r well well you know here we need to focus on the word say is it ever okay for anyone you know black white pink yellow i don't care red orange is it okay for anyone to use this word in a way to put down people to terrorize people to intimidate people answer no but you know and i'd say that black person i've seen i mean by the way i've seen black people use this word to try to intimidate put down other black people bad so i'm against it with a black person white person doesn't matter on the other hand on the other hand imagine imagine a white person who is giving a lecture on the history of american racism a lecture on the history of american racism and in giving that lecture quotes the you know white racist politicians who until fairly recently in american life used the infamous n word so imagine a white history professor giving a lecture about the history of american racism and says in nineteen forty eight this is what so and so running for the presidency of the united states said and then quotes a paragraph or two in which the infamous n word is featured is that bad no that's not bad no that's not bad sounds like a perfectly good lecture and i'm glad that you put the infamous n word in there so that we can see that as recently as nineteen forty eight people who were running for the presidency of the united states openly used the word that does not bother me i'll say this too now you know somebody says well you know nice job kennedy but you've you've you've you know you've limited it to over here you've put it in an academic setting what about other settings it does not bother me let's imagine somebody who's a comedian a white comedian who is satirizing word usage let's imagine a white comedian who is satirizing our current practice and wants to poke fun at the way in which you know let's imagine you have a black rapper who invites people on stage and let's suppose they invite a black person on stage and they're perfectly happy when the black person is full out with you know their lyrics they invite a white person on stage the white person is you know that doesn't really you know sort of mystified but it comes on stage and full out with what the rapper says including the infamous n word and then the black rapper gets mad imagine the white comedian who satirizes that pokes fun at that and in poking fun at that says the infamous n word am i angry no i'm not angry not angry at all what if in the process of satirizing that comedian is not very funny you say that it's bad joke you were not funny okay i don't object i don't object to the use of the infamous n word i just say you know you're not very funny but because there's a there's a line when the joke is not funny it just seems like the the comedy is used as a cover to actually say something hateful it's an interesting thing about comedy i feel like the funnier you are the more you can get away with probably and that's something to do with the the thing we said earlier which is when you use words that have power you should do so with skill and competence mhmm and the responsibility those words carry again the cases that i'm most familiar with are the cases involving teachers professors you know academic and it is said sometimes oh you know why do i object i object sometimes people say because you know i suspect that this teacher just wanted to say the word and that all of this is a cover a pretext do i you know in my sense my sense of it is no i don't think it's a pretext if you know if it's pretextual that's bad but in my experience i have not seen that i don't believe that that's what's going on i agree with you on that but sometimes i do see people that kinda have this fly flying towards the light desire to say something controversial mhmm and edgy mhmm and they don't realize that there's a responsibility there there's a skill they should you shouldn't just say i mean actually when comedians first start out they'll sometimes go into that territory they'll they'll say edgy stuff mhmm that's totally not funny and then you realize this is not like the edgier the thing the more skills required to really serve like if you're if you're cooking as a chef a poisonous fish mhmm there's a responsibility on how to cook the damn thing so you don't poison the people eating it i would agree but to get back to your question let's imagine that somebody produces a new set of lenny bruce albums yeah so lenny bruce was white lenny bruce used the term nigger in his sets sure did question would i want lenny bruce's albums now to be purged of the infamous n word my response absolutely not as another follow on sort of question what you think i've seen interviews you've done about this particular book the title of those interviews on youtube and elsewhere would use the full word mhmm what do you think about that should i use this word in the title in my view the answer would be yes again are there are people i've been on interviews i've you know been on stage with people who had a different conclusion reached and you know i i respect a different way again there there there is a place for for for euphemism again it all you know it all depends i'm not i'm not offended let's imagine let's imagine that you posted this and you had asterisk instead of spelling it out would i be offended no i wouldn't be offended i would prefer the full spelling but i would understand where you're coming from would it offend me no it wouldn't offend me well here's the weird calculation is which version of the word in the title as silly as that is brings more love to the world it's hard mhmm and and basically your answer is i don't know mhmm your your answer is kinda you have to do it and find out i'm not sure i again you know there's certain questions in which there's certain questions you you're not gonna we're not really going to know there's no sociologist who's gonna be able to tell us that so what do we do then then we go to secondary positions and my secondary position is i don't know one thing that i hold on to however very strongly is the virtue of openness the virtue of transparency the virtue of freedom and i feel as though if i'm holding on to those things if i'm trying to engage in a serious conversation in which i'm trying to make other people understand me and i'm listening i feel this is going to eventuate in something positive and you know i i feel okay you are at harvard yeah you're one of the most respected people in the history of harvard that said you did write a book with the n word in it and you also have a lot of opinions that challenge the mainstream perspectives on race from all sides hopefully we'll get to talk about some of them but what's your view on harvard and universities in general and speech yeah did you feel pressure from any direction on on first of all the title of this book the content of the book and in general your views on race yeah i am very laudatory of harvard university i've been at harvard since nineteen eighty four i think it is a wonderful place to work i there has not there i i have you know in in in the various positions i've taken with is in in particularly with respect to this book or all my other books what has harvard university done harvard university has done nothing but provide support sustenance encouragement you know i think that people get down on harvard university i would say to anybody imagine the following imagine that the ethos of harvard university became the governing ethos of the united states overnight tomorrow we would wake up in a much better united states of america i you know i i i have i've been supported by harvard university i think well of harvard university that's not to say that i don't have criticisms of it but by and large harvard university more than by and large overwhelmingly it has provided me and i think it overwhelmingly provides my colleagues with a work setting in which they can do their work without fear and you know that's a good thing are there certain are there certain you know aspects of harvard university about which i'm critical yeah sure by the way i think a few people rightfully wrongfully would disagree with you that if the ethos of harvard university took over the country it'd be a better place mhmm but there's a lot of interesting ways to break that down because harvard there's not one ethos there's a lot of things going on that are very interesting yes but one of the things that's happening is the disproportionate and a kind of aggressive growth of the administration versus faculty and students i i think the power of university should always be with the faculty and the students that's where the beauty is that's where the flourishing happens and the more you have kind of rules and bureaucracy and all this kind of stuff the less powerful the university is i think that at my university and at many universities that's right there's too much bureaucracy too much regulation and you know are there are there dangers to freedom of expression at my university and at other universities answer yeah there are there are so and this has really hit home for me there was a there was a period of time in which i was i was getting off of you know i i'd gotten i'd gotten off of all boards i was just doing my work forget it i'm just gonna do my work i'm not gonna be on you know associated with any organizations in the last five years that has changed quite dramatically i have i have gotten on various i've i've reassociated myself with various organizations mainly organizations involving academic freedom because of what's going on at you know on university campuses again i have been at least thus far thus far this hasn't pinched me where i live but you mean in the space of ideas in the space of ideas in the space of speech in the face of you know teaching you know i i haven't i haven't been pinched but i am concerned about things so for instance let's imagine that you're applying for a job you know you wanna be an assistant professor or let's suppose that you're seeking a promotion and you know on many university campuses you are asked to give a dei statement in which you say i plan to you know you know one one of the reasons why you should hire me or one of the reasons why you should promote me is because i'm going to you know advance the you know the dei ambitions diversity equity and inclusion for people who don't know this is the general the set of programs that most universities now have yes that's right so you know you've got a sort of you know basically what you're being asked to do whether they say it explicitly or not they don't say this explicitly but this is what they're being this is what is up what you're being asked to do is to say i'm down with the diversity equity and inclusion ethos program policy campaign and here's what i've done that shows that i'm down with this program and therefore i'm okay well you know a lot of what i do would fit very comfortably within that but let's suppose that i didn't just suppose i didn't like this and by the way there's certain aspects of the b dei you know industry that i don't like you mean to tell me that you know i'm being judged at an academic institution let's suppose i wanna be a chemist let's suppose i wanna be a physicist let's suppose i wanna be i don't care you know a a a you know a critic of literature i oppose this program i don't you know i'm i i i don't think this is the way in which higher education should be going should i have to on pain of relinquishing my ability to be hired should i have to sign on to this just suppose and let let let's change it around let's not make it a dei campaign let's make it a make america great again campaign what would we think then let's suppose it was something that said instead of it saying dei let's make it let's make it say the advancement of american capitalism as we know it we want you to be down with that what have you done that shows us that you believe in the advancement of capitalism in america would i be happy about no i would say this is no well no with respect to these as far as i'm concerned with the you know the dei statements oh here's another one i just learned and in fact i mean there there are certain things that are happening and i must say i mean i'm in academia but it it's it's news to me i didn't know until relatively recently about positionality statements so these are statements in which somebody writes an article let's suppose i know i write an article and it's not enough for me just to submit my article to some law review or to some you know some other sort of journal no in addition to me submitting my article i've got to give a a positionality statement in which i say whether i am you know gay or straight or what what have you in which i say my race in which i say my nationality in which i say my you know my stance toward this ideological position or that ideological position interesting what is this becoming a kind of a standard i don't know how widespread spread it is i know there was a night a very good article in the new york times a couple of days ago about these positionality statements and in fact that's what sort of tipped me off somebody had told me there's a law review at my home institution and i had a friend who sort of mentioned this off handedly and who who said well i submitted an article to this journal and i was a little bit taken aback insofar as they did have me fill out a questionnaire in which in which i was required to state my race state this state that state the other and you know as far as i'm concerned well what does that have to do with a proper assessment of somebody's work this concerns me i'm concerned about the fact you you know a a a little while ago you mentioned a little while ago you mentioned the word negro at i was talking with colleagues couple months ago and somebody mentioned that this word had come up in their class because what happened was one student was reading from a supreme court decision and the word negro was part of what they read out and another student held up his hand and said to the student who was reading a you should be careful because you know i find the word negro offensive and you need to be careful about even saying a word that would be offensive to someone and this person and then you know the teacher was you know well you know you know what should i say in those circumstances you know what should i have said and i volunteered you know and you know and you know and i said well gosh that's really interesting because see if that had come up in my class i would have said well frankly i don't you know i don't see what the the i don't even see what the big deal is because i used the word negro and you know harvard university is not on you know on some island that is you know apart from everything else that's happening in the world if these things are happening in other places if they're happening at stanford if they're happening at yale if they're happening at columbia you know they're gonna happen at harvard but thus far and i'm i'm i am most especially experienced in life at harvard law school harvard law school is an open environment in which ideas are tested and they are tested fully and it's it's it's because of that that i say i have been fully supported at harvard law school feel that it is an excellent place in which to do work i'm a i'm i'm a fan i am a fan and i'm not embarrassed to say it i am a fan of of of my workplace harvard law school very happy to be associated with harvard law school zooming out in general in education there's something called critical race theory mhmm can you comment on what are your thoughts about this kind of perspective on race and race in america to the degree that it's becoming a part yeah the education program okay so the first thing i wanna say what is it well the first thing i wanna say about critical race theory is that critical race theory has become a term so i'm gonna put quotation marks around the term critical race theory we can we in a minute i'll talk about critical race theory without quotation marks but to begin with i wanna talk about critical race theory because the reason why people are talking about critical race theory so much now is because politicians mainly republican right wing politicians have created a boogeyman critical race theory with quotation marks around it they have created a boogeyman and they have tried to make it seem as though this boogeyman believes all sorts of ideas that americans should loathe and that americans should fear and they've created this boogeyman and they've created it and they've done a very good job of creating the boogeyman and they have mobilized sufficient you know public support such that you know there are a number of states that have passed laws prohibiting the teaching of so called critical race theory now the first thing i wanna say about this is that this campaign this these laws these various policies telling teachers don't teach this and don't teach that and you can't you can't use this book you can't use that book this is a frightening encroachment on freedom freedom of speech freedom to learn freedom to listen freedom to read that's terrible and it's one of the most frightening things that has happened in american life in recent memory so that's the first thing i wanna say about so called critical race theory now now i'll say something i'm gonna take the quotation marks off of the term critical race theory critical race theory is is a sort of a you you could have a nice conversation about actually what it is one way of viewing it is to say that well critical race theory is a community of ideas that comes from a community of people the community of people would be people in legal academia in the you know the period nineteen eight starting and probably the middle of the nineteen eighties it would be associated with people like derrick bell it would be associated with people like kimberly crenshaw people like charles lawrence people like richard delgado people like mary matsuda and these are folks who held embraced a couple of you know they they they articulated a couple of propositions one of their propositions was that liberal race policy was insufficient they would say that the racial policies of a person like my old boss thurgood marshall the lib you know the liberal liberal racial policies were insufficient to grapple fully with the pervasiveness and the depth and intensity of american racism their their basic claim and i think by the way it was a good claim their basic claim was that american racism is more central more deeply embedded in american life than most people perceived including liberals and and i think there was a lot of strength to that proposition but then they also took on some other propositions with which i was in very strong disagreement so i think it's perfectly fine to say that racism is a force in american life that is deeper more pervasive more stubborn more resilient than i think people often you know often understand often perceive but then some of the folks you know in in you know critical race theory push further one of the propositions that some of the people in critical race theory took was the proposition that america was doomed to always be a country that would be governed according to the dictates of white supremacy derrick bell who was a colleague of mine and a friend of mine took that position he talked about the permanence of racism in american life and he took the position that the various changes that had been wrought in american life were really you know mainly cosmetic they didn't amount to a whole lot i mean derrick bell took the position you know the the second reconstruction the civil rights movement well it made changes but at the end of the day black people were still you know after the second reconstruction were still in a position of almost you know you know i don't know some of them would even say neoslavery well i think that's ridiculous the second reconstruction changed a lot and as for neoslavery neoslavery what are you talking about a black american was president of the united states between the years two thousand eight and two thousand sixteen i mean what what are we talking about here there's been a tremendous change and i think people ought to understand that now am i saying that everything is peachy keen and alright no the united states is still to a very large extent still a pigmentocracy but that doesn't mean that a lot hasn't changed a lot has so i disagree with certain tenets of critical race theory and have been very outspoken in my disagreement there's another one by the way i i need to mention because we've talked so much in our discussion about freedom of speech freedom to teach freedom of listening another big problem that i've had with some of the people who talk of themselves as critical race theory people has to do with their attitude towards freedom freedom of speech some critical race theory people think that the american legal system is wrong in the latitude that it gives to what they call hate speech or the latitude that it gives to what they would view as racist beliefs some of some of the people who associate themselves with critical race theory think that racist beliefs ought to be expunged with the aid of state power if need be well i'm against that and you know i i think we are at a moment a an ironic moment in which actually it's the right wing that has embraced some of the ideas that were championed by some of this some of the people who call themselves critical race theorists you know they say oh we ought to expunge hate speech well the right wing is saying this critical race theory that's hate speech so let's expunge it and so i you know again i've been very outspoken in my criticism of some of the illiberal dimensions of critical race theory so i've you know i've been a critic of certain features of critical race theory i have applauded certain features of critical race theory you know critical race theory you know there's some aspects of it that i think have been useful there's some aspects of it that i think have been you know profoundly wrong edit so that's where i am and i certainly and you know above all i certainly am against any efforts to remove it from you know the intellectual universe it is a part of our intellectual universe people ought to know about it and people ought to debate it and people ought to be free to make up their minds to conclude what they will about the strengths and weaknesses of critical race theory and we'll talk about the pessimistic and the optimistic perspective on race in the history of the twentieth century in america i think you have very interesting perspectives there but before that i'd love to look at the current moment and you had a conversation with glenn lowry and john mcwhirter and from there it became clear to me i think john made clear how important to the conversation about race is policing into in today's society that that's where a lot of african americans feel is sort of the the pinnacle of racism sits the people that believe there's still racism in america there's still a lot of racism in america that's where it is so to what degree do you think there's widespread institutional racism in policing yeah well my first book yep was a book called race crime and the law and nineteen ninety seven nineteen ninety seven wow time flies time flies unfortunately unfortunately the the impetus behind that book stands that book was propelled by a sense that with respect to the administration of criminal justice african americans are feel deeply aggrieved and they feel deeply aggrieved with good reason and they feel deeply aggrieved with good reason in at least two dimensions on the one hand on the one hand african americans suffer from underprotection and in fact in that book the central theme of that book was that black americans suffer from underprotection if you take a look at the broad you know the sort of the broad trajectory of american history and ask yourself you know in what way have black americans americans been most oppressed well take a look at the antebellum period period before the abolition of slavery before the abolition of slavery in the the the locales where most black people resided namely the slave states in a lot of those areas question was there a crime called the murder of a black person answer for a long period the answer was no there might have been a tort you know so if a white person killed the slave killed a slave that person could be sued because they had they had injured the property of another and would have to pay money to you know for that but had they committed a crime answer no in the antebellum period were black women protected against the crime of rape in most states the answer was no there was no such crime let's go to after you know slavery is abolished thank god slavery is abolished then let's see you know what happens what you know so we hear lynching lynching but in the from from eighteen ninety until let's say nineteen thirty well in the you know in eighteen ninety there were there was probably you know i would say but there was probably on average a lynching every day in the united states you know well over three hundred lynchings it goes down that was the case in the eighteen nineties probably the first decade of the twentieth century and then it starts going down what was lynching about lynching was about black people being executed outside the law did the legal system do anything about that answer no you know you you show me show me cases in which people were prosecuted criminally for engaging in lynching you come up in most places with a null set black people suffered the underprotection of the law do black people still suffer the underprotection of the law the answer is yes and people talk about the kerner commission report nineteen sixty eight black people were asked you know with respect to the police what's your what's your main complaint in many places the main complaint was we don't have police protection you know when when when things happen to us when our houses are burgled when our businesses are encroached upon by robbers when our businesses are robbed when we're assaulted you know nothing happens the police protect white people they don't protect us under protection our society right now if you take a look at the statistics who is most liable to be raped robbed the victim of assault what have you black people i mean and and it's and it's not even close under protection so that's one way in which the administration of criminal justice harms black people by not doing what government is supposed to do which is protect us fourteenth amendment you know protect equal protection i underline protection of the law so that was a big theme of race crime and the law now second thing second and this is the thing that gets most attention and it's important i think that the underprotection story does not get enough attention but then there's a second story the second story is that black people have historically and still today black people are subjects of invidious racial discrimination when it comes to when it comes to police action so you know walking down the street mhmm walking down the street you have a black person who's let's say twenty years old you have a white person who's twenty years old let's make them men they're both just walking down the street and the question attitude of the police towards these two and attitude you know is a complicated thing it can show itself in various ways it can show itself in a look it can show itself in who who gets the look you know black persons you know walking down the street or running down the street white persons walking down the street or running down the street what happens with respect to the police let's suppose that you know who who gets the second look who is followed who is detained for a moment well some of it is just on a small tangent i apologize to interrupt but attitude is an interesting one because a lot of it a lot of the interaction doesn't show up in the data mhmm so detained for example starts showing up in the data but before then the second look the third look the first look this is where the gray area of conversation happens because very much so culture and society happens in the stuff several years ago i was i was in new york city several years ago i was i was in new york city and it was at a time when there was a lot of discussion over the stop and frisk stop and frisk basically you know racial profiling on the street i was walking i was i was i was in harlem i'm walking down the street and frankly the you know the police weren't bothering me i'm just walking no no police weren't bothering me maybe you know i'm of a certain age i i did notice though i was i was looking at the police and the way that the police attitude you know had to do with body posture it had to do with that's right who got a second look it had to i noticed i'm i'm walking in the street i'm walking in harlem there you know there there are white people in the street you know most of the people though were black some some hispanic the level of contempt the level of animus the level of unfriendliness that was pouring off the cop the police they weren't they didn't say anything nope they didn't detain they didn't say anything it was palpable i could feel the attitude that was being being directed at the young black men and the thing is see the thing is it's not as if this doesn't matter it matters because the way i saw it these young black men knew they felt the contempt that the police were shedding and this was gonna have a consequence the consequence it was gonna have is let's imagine that the police did say excuse me you know what are you up to now if you have been feeling this contempt if you feel like the officer who is asking this question doesn't like you doesn't know anything about you but just doesn't like you on-site you might answer in a certain sort of way you're not going to give the cop the benefit of the doubt and basically think well you know policeman's just you know asking me this you know probably just trying to make the neighborhood safe well if if that's your feeling you know policeman's just asking me this trying to make the neighborhood safe well officer the reason why i'm here is such and such and you know thanks for your service that's one response another response is i'm not gonna tell you anything you know i'm not gonna tell you anything i know that you don't mean me any i don't i know that you don't mean me any good i'm not gonna tell you anything am i free to leave and then the cop having heard that then says something back you know after five minutes what do you have you have an altercation on your hand and i i felt that and that is part and you're absolutely right that's not written down it doesn't get to court it's it's it's it's there but it's it's an important part of street life it's an informal part of street and it has ripple effects because that young black man will probably talk shit about that cop later that day so the narrative persists and then the cop will also talk shit and then there's these narratives yep and i think the contempt is such a it's such a powerful thing it's so hard to disentangle because you're absolutely right the young man let's suppose that the story ends quote well right he's gonna go and he's gonna be talking with his friends and he's gonna say let me let me tell you what just happened to me and his friends are gonna say oh yeah that doesn't surprise me let me tell you what what happened to me and you know for two hours this goes on the anger the feeling of humiliation the feeling of aggrievement grows it's disseminated and that's part of what we have but that's not all of that's not that's that's that's you know that's a important part of what we have but we have it's even worse than that because then you ask the question you know what about what about things we do know i know this from you know from my teaching this was brought up you know there was a lawsuit in new york city and notice i didn't say you know i didn't i didn't say birmingham alabama i didn't say atlanta georgia i didn't say tallahassee florida i didn't say you know the deep south i didn't say montana i didn't say idaho new york city you know cosmopolitan place metropolis in new york city the police were challenged with respect to their policies a judge wrote a very lengthy opinion and the facts were rolled out and the facts were really quite horrifying people they were they were they were they were black men who had been stopped many many times it wasn't just once over and over and over again under circumstances in which they ought not have been stopped and you know this has real consequences it doesn't just show up here though of course it also shows up in other places with respect to the administration of justice and we still have you know a big problem now you mentioned you know the police if you ask yourself who are the state agents that are most consequential the police i mean you walking down the street what other agents have guns on them what other agents are authorized by the law to shoot you under certain circumstance it's the police the police are the most consequential agents of the state that most people interact with i mean there's there's to push back a little bit to consequential in a in a in a physical sense but if we return to the power of the psychological sense of contempt i would say store clerks and stuff like that can also be a source of contempt agents of the state right but if we look at the landscape of contempt which throughout the twentieth century you know or the bus right you can experience the same kind of contempt you can in other aspects of society but yes the cops can i would still put the police the policeman or the police person is the person walking down the street with a gun gun yeah and if you think about the way in which the law the the extent to which the police are authorized to use their force the police have extraordinary you know extraordinary authority mhmm you know you look look look you're you're you're driving your car and you're speeding the police could arrest you right then and there and take you to jail that's an extraordinary power but they also have because of that the leverage just one human to another they have more leverage to be an asshole and to show contempt to you they certainly do to be to be the lesser to lean in to the lesser aspects of their natures all humans can just to be an asshole to show contempt you had a bad day they have the the more freedom to do that yes and that's why that's why police officers are very important i recognize i mean i i you know i know police officers they have a very difficult job a very important job very important again remember what i talked about under protection i want the police to protect me i want the police to protect me from the rapist the robber so i you know the police i'm with the police we need good policing we but we need good policing and for good policing we need accountability and one of the scandals one of the just absolute scandals of american law is the extent to which the police are not held accountable it's absolutely remarkable the the degree to which american law fails to properly hold police accountable they have an important job a difficult job i want them to be very well paid as far as i'm concerned you know we should be police should make more money they should be given given the importance of what they do they should have more respect more prestige more money with all of that they should be held accountable and the way things are now they're not held accountable and every day we see the consequences in our newspapers or just you know talking with people so what do you make of the different perspective on this from to to bring up a person that i'll probably speak with heather mcdonald mhmm who wrote a book called war on cops and will often bring up the stuff that does show up in the data to show the disproportionate amount of homicides committed by african americans and we'll also justify racial profiling on that basis mhmm in stop and frisk programs and we'll also bring up things like the ferguson effect saying that because of this pushbacks pushback and all the stuff we've been saying about police the in those areas the police will step back and crime will increase mhmm i was on one debate with her and one of the things that i said is it was a debate that was that was sponsored by the federalist society conservative legal group you know these we're law conservative law students at at harvard law school we had a she made a presentation and they asked me to respond and one of the things that i said was when we're talking about the police i'm i'm disappointed with the reaction of some of my conservative colleagues and i would consider her to be one of my conservative colleagues because what are the sort of the what are some of the the important precepts of conservatives one very important precept of conservatives limited government limited government you know what do conservatives talk about the tendency of government to overreach itself and governmental agents to overreach themselves and i say you're right you're right i i you know right on why is it that you somehow forget that when you're talking about the police when you're talking about the police you're never you you you seem to be unaware of this tendency that is so much in your consciousness and other places but now when you're talking about the police you make it seem as though i'm you know other people are being paranoid when they talk about the danger of overreach we need to be very careful about the danger of overreach another thing with respect to the pollute what do conserve conservatives transparency in government you're right you're absolutely right we need transparency in government so why is it that so often when we're talking about policing why is it that conservatives actually embrace police unions and are the enemies of transparency why is it that you want to prevent the citizenry from knowing that officer so and so has you know there have been ten incidents in the last year in which citizens have complained about officer so and so don't you think that the citizenry ought to know that why is it that you want to keep that under wraps so overreach transparency the tendency or you know the problem of governmental agent corruption why is it that those sorts of things are forgotten about when some conservatives by the way not all conservatives not all conservatives there's some conservatives who has stuck and appropriately so to their guns and have said a we need to make sure that the police stay in their lane we need to make sure that the police do not overstep constitutional bounds we need to be we need to insist on transparency there are some conservatives who have taken that line and i salute them but there are a lot of conservatives and i would say heather mcdonald was one of them who all of a sudden become just you know totally uncritical status when they're talking about the police so the the overstepping overreach the lack of transparency of course we see this kind of stuff in foreign policy as well which is starting military conflicts and a a lot of the supporters at least with the iraq and afghanistan wars were conservatives and and hawks and so on so there's a lot of hypocrisy in terms of principles and so on but maybe one question is in this discussion about racism and policing there's a lot of cops that might listen to this and feel like they're not being their profession is not being respected they're not being heard not being respected to the difficulty of of the problem they're facing mhmm and can i just interject jack remember a few moments ago i mean if if if if i were in charge of things if i were in charge of things i'd pay police more in fact much more than they receive i do police have a very difficult job extraordinarily difficult job i mean for one thing you know sort of maintaining the law the law that's a very complicated thing the law that's not an easy thing i mean i teach law i spend a lot of hours with very smart people trying to understand the law very difficult so here we expect people to understand the law at the same time that they are grappling with people some of whom are violent it's very difficult i respect police officers and i said we need police officers you did not hear me say by the way so for so let's let's get down to brass tacks you did not hear me say defund the police did you in fact to the contrary i said defund actually i want more funds for the police i wanna hold them accountable i understand the difficulty of their job i respect the police i want people to respect the police i also want the police to respect civilians and demand that they do i am not a police abolitionist far from it far from it again we need good policing for good policing we need good people to what degree it's almost philosophically maybe practically do you think police should be doing racial profiling profiling in general mhmm okay it's a very difficult philosophical moral human question yeah so first thing we need to do and here we get back to the you know early part of our conversation because we focus so much on you know first part of a word here we have another word profiling question what is racial profiling now here we have you know in the weeds we have people talking past one another i've been in conversations with police officers in debates and we talk past one another because we are defining racial profiling very differently if you ask i've been on i've been in conversations with police officers and they say oh i'm totally against racial profiling and then i say well you know sir what do you mean by racial profiling and here's what they say racial profiling is when police officers act against somebody wholly on the basis of race that is that gets rid of the issue because you know most police officers don't act against anyone wholly on the basis of race you could have the most racist police officer and that that police officer is not going to act adversely against the ninety year old black woman walking down the street with a cane okay so it's always and so they're they're you know if you define racial profiling that way you're getting rid of the issue the issue is the proper issue is this should the police be able to act against someone taking race into account as a factor so let's imagine that a black person who's twenty five years old is walking down the street right next to a white person who's twenty five years old some people would say you know what under those circumstances it's okay for the police officer to give two looks at the black person and only one look at the white person why because the statistics tell us that the black twenty five year old there's much more risk of that person acting in an unlawful way if you take a look at you know crime statistics and ask the question with respect to you know homicide with respect to robbery with respect to various you know crimes what's the what what is there a is there is there a difference between the white twenty five year old and the black twenty five year old with respect to to certain crimes the answer is in certain places the answer is yeah there is a difference and there is a and there is a greater risk that the black twenty five year old has engaged in various forms of criminality i'm not you know that okay under those circumstances what do i say should the police officer therefore be allowed to take action vis a vis the black person as you know as against the white person my answer is no i'm fully willing to concede let's concede for the point of you know for the point of discussion that there is more risk there might be there might be but for for reasons of constructing the sort of society i want we should not empower agents of the state to act towards certain people in a way that's you know adverse to them let me try to break this down in a little different way let's go back to let's let's let's let's talk about what happens when you wanna get on an airplane you know wasn't so long you know nine eleven wasn't all that long ago it was a while ago but it wasn't all that long ago and this very issue came up with the respect to the profiling of muslims and there were some people who said well jeez you know in the aftermath of nine eleven profiling of muslims makes sense you know no hard feelings but you know the eleven people who you know were on those planes were all muslims now there is a rationale you could just simply say it's not it's not prejudice it's not animus it's not invidious it's just you know the facts take us this way well the facts never take us this way there are facts and then there is our choice of how we want to respond to those facts now you could respond by saying well we perceive muslims to be more likely to you know do bad things on an airliner you could you could respond in that way on the other hand you could say no we want a society in which people are do not have to grapple with prejudice on the basis of their religion or on the basis of their race and to deal with that we are gonna demand we're gonna demand that agents of the state act towards people in the same way and so if that means that everybody getting on the airplane before they get on the airplane has to you know open up their luggage and it slows things down but everybody has to open up their luggage i would prefer that over a system in which we focus on people who are muslim and one of the reasons and i'm a i'm a bring this back to our to the racial thing one of the reasons why i i wanna insist upon that is because if you know if we all have to open up our luggage what that means is we're all paying a tax for more security and we're all likely to ask ourselves do we wanna pay this tax whereas if we focus simply on the muslims and allow the muslims to be the only ones who are sort of paying the tax we'll foist that on them same in the you know black person white person twenty five years old walking down the street do we want to impose a racial tax on the black twenty five year old some people would say yes i say that's a mistake black people aren't stupid they know that they're paying this tax it is a violation of it seems to me the rules that we ought to want to have to govern our society i say spread the costs make the police deal with everybody the same and don't don't allow a situation to develop in which a group of people can can accurately say we are paying more of a cost than these other people over here so it's a better avoiding profile is while it may have costs on security in the short term in the long term it's the embodiment of the principles that all men are created equal so it has a much bigger benefit yes right in representing the fairness yes that is at the core of the ideals of this country yes let me ask a big philosophical question why do you think there is racism in the world oh now you've okay fine you've now you've asked me a question in which i throw up my hands and i don't know will there always be why is there tribalism are humans always finding this way to divide ourselves and how bad of a problem is that it's a huge problem i don't you know i mean i i i don't i'm not gonna pretend that i know enough to grapple in a satisfactory way with such a question i mean to really grapple with that question one really has to have all you know a a very broad knowledge base in which they can make comparisons i mean the world's a big place now from from the little bit i know about the world you know i i i read i read as much as i can i've been i'm a very privileged character i mean i i live in a university so i'm reading constantly and listening constantly from what i gather the problem of divided societies is a problem that is worldwide there's you know and it seems as though it seems as though human ingenuity is such that humans will find something to divide over you know it might be texture of hair it might be you know complexion of skin political ideology political ideology if the texture if the texture if the texture of skin is the same it'll then be well you know you you wear these sorts of clothes you speak in this sort of way you believe this whereas i believe that i mean it seems like a human ingenuity is such they will humans will find some way of distinguishing themselves and then they seem to want to embellish the distinction it's not just a distinction it's not just you believe this and i believe this okay that makes world interesting you know let's talk about what you believe and what i believe no it's usually associated with you believe this i believe this of course my my belief is superior to your belief and i wanna put you down and now we're headed towards war the interesting thing is if i were to step outside of this whole thing from an alien perspective visiting earth i think america is one of the greatest if not the greatest countries in the history of human civilization and i think that the the line between white and black the racial struggle is the thing that in part made it a great nation there's something about the division and the way you alleviate that division through the struggle for human rights that makes for a great nation and so it's interesting that the division is almost the fuel for the greatness for our discovery of what it means to be human what it means to be or or what justice means of and it's interesting that it seems like there's this struggle that you're you're we're you're elucidating now but that struggle itself is our search man's search for meaning and justice and freedom i think there's something to that as you were speaking i was immediately thinking of the person who you know most jumped to mind was the great frederick douglass so i mean here you have a person who in my view is one of the great people in the history of the world and you know one of the things that ironically enabled him to become one of the great people of the world he was born a he was born into slavery his overcoming was the very thing that in a sense made him this larger than life figure and i think there's something to you i i will say this because a minute ago you mentioned optimism and pessimism and i'd say in the last few years my feeling about the united states has changed and it's changed in a somber way for most of my life for most of my life i've been in the optimistic camp with respect to my view of american race relations you know the the optimistic camp that was the camp that's the camp that believes we shall overcome that's that's martin luther king's camp i mean martin luther king you know martin luther king you know hours before he's killed i've been to the mountaintop i might not get there with you but i've glimpsed the promised land that optimism frederick douglass would be in that would be in that tradition there would be other people wonderful good people who would be in that tradition would you sorry to interrupt put it in the pessimist camp would you put malcolm x in the oh in the pessimistic camp the pessimistic camp is the more interesting camp i mean ideological i mean it is it's the more interesting camp because in the pessimistic camp you have i mean if i was gonna list some of my pessimists pessimist number one thomas jefferson thomas jefferson the author you know principal author declaration of independence he was also the author of notes on the state of virginia and he said in notes on the state of virginia basically we shall not overcome he talked he said you know the black people will always know that their forebears were enslaved and they will always be resentful of that always be aggrieved by that jefferson did not think that we would ever have in the united states a multiracial democracy he was very critical of slavery now he was a hypocrite he had slaves he sold slaves he was terrible in that way but he did understand that slavery was horrible but he did not want he he he but he he did not wanna free the slaves for a variety of reasons but in one reason was because he thought that it would be impossible to have a society in which blacks and whites were equal neighbors he was thoroughly pessimistic another pessimist alexis de tocqueville thoroughly pessimistic so who were some of the other pessimists abraham lincoln pessimistic that's why he was so interested in colonization he basically said you know i don't like slavery but blacks and whites are not gonna be able to share the united states maybe the best we can do is just you know put blacks ship blacks someplace else can you elaborate on that i i i think people would be surprised to hear oh yeah that you will put abraham lincoln in the pessimist camp oh abraham lincoln's thoroughly pessimistic he was a he he believed he was anti he he was antislavery but he did not believe that blacks and whites would be able to share the united states together and he was always very interested therefore in colonization even after the even during the civil war he was interested in you know may maybe maybe maybe all black people would all black people be interested in maybe going to panama would they be interested in going someplace else because you know lincoln was aware of how racist white people were including himself and he did not think that black people and white people would be able to share the united states now there's a black nationalist tradition you mentioned malcolm x well before malcolm x you know marcus garvey my father my father was a thoroughgoing pessimist his view was a the united states was born as a white man's country it's gonna remain a white man's country and that's the way it is he was thoroughly pessimistic you mentioned just a brief aside about your dad that when you moved from south carolina to washington dc and you asked him why his response to you was because either a white man was going to kill me or i was going to kill a white man yes so he saw race as an important line that divided people in the united states he certainly did and he thought that the line my my father did not my father had passed away before the elect before obama was elected i would have loved to have talked with my dad what do you think he would have said and you've written you wrote a book about the obama presidency i did i did and i didn't i never what would my father has my father would have been delighted my father would have been happy about his election i do think though i do think that my father would have said i'm happy that barack obama has been elected hold on to your seats let's see how the white people respond so he would have predicted donald trump i think that my father i think that in twenty sixteen i think that in twenty sixteen he would have said i told you yes yes i think that in twenty sixteen my father would have said all of you people who are talking about i don't know what's happened to america and how could this have happened and you know no i think my father would have said this is america being america and what has happened is that america has been put off kilter by a black family being in the white house it has deranged millions of white people and now this is coming home to roost so i think my father would have absolutely said in twenty sixteen i told you so in twenty sixteen as you're saying is the reason that you have at least dipped your toe outside of the optimist camp into the pessimist camp i'm i yeah i wanna be careful here and i don't wanna don't give up on the optimist camp i don't wanna i don't you you're right i don't wanna give up on the optimist camp i don't i i it it i have been my optimism has definitely been dampened it's definitely been tested i am certainly no i'm i am i am not i am not as triumphalist as i once was i am not as indignant as i once was in my criticism of pessimists but at this moment as we speak you know am i more in the optimist camp than i'm in the pessimist camp i mean i'm still probably more in the optimist camp but my optimism has been dampened but as i speak i have to say the following things and i'd say the following things if my father but again whom i revere great man but if my father was sitting here with us i would say listen pop it's absolutely true that the country is more racist than i had thought that is true it's also true pop that the vice president of the united states as we speak is a black woman as we speak it's true that the secretary of defense now secretary of defense the secretary of defense is the head of the pentagon the secretary of defense knows where the button is okay this is not a little you know this is not a small out of the way thing this is the sec the secretary of defense is a black man there are a slew of black generals there have been black secretaries of state there are black people who are the heads of police forces there are black mayors there are black people who are the heads of our you know some of our foremost foundations there are you know the the the the president-elect of harvard university is a black woman and we could go on and on and on and on this is not you know we're not when i was growing up when i was growing up when i was let's say ten years old we got a magazine ebony magazine every month and in ebony magazine you could turn to the middle of ebony and they would have black firsts the first black person to do this the first black person to do this you could read ebony and frankly i could tell you all of those for i knew their names now i read stuff you know the you know the the the the leading cadet the chief cadet at the you know united states naval academy i'm reading i'm reading then i see a picture black woman i i didn't know that mhmm back in the day i would have known that now has the united states changed yes is there racism yes is it you know a substantial force in american life regrettably tragically yes has the united states changed yes and again if we wanna go go international the united states is not the only country that is a country that has wrestled with deep division you think about i don't know think about india think about you know the united kingdom think about practically any large nation state they've all grappled with divisions if one asks about the united states and the race question and one puts on the table that you know in eighteen sixty five now you know when i talk with students i say eighteen sixty five they think oh my god you know isn't that when dinosaurs roamed no it wasn't when dinosaurs roamed eighteen sixty five frankly is not all that long ago in eighteen sixty five the great mass of black people in the united states had recently been released from chattel slavery the great mass of black people in the united states in eighteen sixty five were illiterate now i mean it's absolutely it's it's an absolutely extraordinary story and so one of the difficulties i have at this moment is wrapping my head around two stories that are in such tension with one another one is the continuing story of racism which is an awful story but the other story is a story that is encapsulated in the title of a great book of history by john hope franklin from slavery to freedom and you know those are two stories in american life and it takes an awful lot to put your mind around both stories and i'm trying to well as an optimist i think you put more value to the overcoming side of the story the overcoming of hardship the overcoming of slavery of discrimination well since you mentioned illiteracy from what is it a hundred and fifty years ago let me ask you about affirmative action you wrote a book on the topic mhmm titled for discrimination race affirmative action and the law first what is affirmative action mhmm and maybe we could talk about what your view is on it today sure well affirmative action refers to racial affirmative action because there's various sorts of affirmative action i mean you can have affirmative action for veterans you can have affirmative action for in state residents let's suppose you have a school you know the university of you know blah blah blah and we're gonna we're gonna we want to reach a we we're we're gonna give a reach out a a a hand to boost help people who live within the state we're gonna have a boost for veterans we're gonna have a boost for you know for women we're gonna have a boost for men in in certain circumstances well we're the the the the most the the type of affirmative action that gets most attention and that's worth noting as well there are lots of there's some sorts of affirmative action but when you say affirmative action the type of affirmative action that immediately people are thinking about is racial affirmative seems like race is at the core of this american experiment though part of in every part of its bingo culture bingo you know why is it that you know we again you know there's various there's various ways in which institutions reach out to help various sectors of our population why is it that this is the one that generates all of the pulling out of hair and gnashing of teeth we can put that to the side for a moment racial affirmative action refers to efforts in which institutions you know reach out to provide assistance to racial minorities now the reaching out has you know can can happen in different ways a light form of affirmative action might be reaching out in terms of recruiting making a special effort to make sure that young people let's say in racial minority neighborhoods know about your college you know that's you know recruitment on the other hand racial affirmative action might take more you know may might take a stronger form and might take the form of saying okay we have a competition and we think that there will be too few racial minority kids who do well enough in this competition to be to be admitted to our school so what we're gonna do is we are going to in various ways give a boost to the minority kids if if it comes down to you have two kids they both you know i don't know have you know ninety nine on the test there's one place left we only have one spot left two kids one's a black kid one's a white kid they both got ninety nine we're gonna give it to the black kid why well black kid that's all all there is to it the black kid we wanna you know maybe and then our theory you know maybe our theory is that black people have been done wrong in the united states and we want our institution to contribute to making amends that might be a theory another theory might be you know we as a as we we we think that we'll have a more interesting student body we'll have a better student body a more you know better discussion if there are more black kids on campus and unless we make a special effort to bring more black kids on campus the you know our our our student body will be overwhelmingly monoracial we'll just have you know white kids few asian kids a few latino kids if there are no black kids here i don't know you know it'll it'll be lacking an important aspect of american life so that's some sort of you know the so called diversity story so anyway there are various theories some are grounded like i said in reparative justice some might be grounded in distributive justice so for instance when people say nowadays you know we want a cabinet we want a team we want a student body that looks like america that might be a a distributive justice theory for why you want affirmative action unless we reach out as unless we reach out and give a boost to certain groups they won't be here and we want a campus that looks like america and we won't have a campus that looks like america unless we give a special boost to i don't know the latino kids or unless we give a special boost to black applicants so reparative justice distributive justice or third diversity we just wanna have an interesting student body and to have an interesting student body we want you know kids from a wide array of places we think that that'll make for a better campus more interesting campus those are three justifications all of which however are justifications for in a competition giving a special boost to some people based on their race so what's your sense can you make the case for affirmative action and can you make the case against it yeah i can make the case for and i can make the case against the case for i won't spend much time on this like i said there there are three there are three main justifications your audience should know that one the justification that actually led to affirmative action is a justification that you don't hear about in the courts because the courts have said that that justification is insufficient so the real justification behind affirmative action was you know in the late nineteen sixties in the aftermath of the civil rights revolution and the aftermath of the civil rights movement there was a feeling that well okay fine we're not discriminating against black people anymore but black people have been disadvantaged by the discrimination that has been put upon them and this discrimination that was put upon them has disabled them and so they go into competitions and it's unfair yeah they score less well on the standardized test but you know surprise surprise what the heck they went to schools in which they got the leavings of the white folks you know the white folks gave the black folks the old textbooks that's what the black kids read the white kids read the newest textbooks on and on and on so reparative justice we're gonna try to repair the scars left by past racial injustice and we're gonna and so it's sort of an effort to overcome the vestiges of past misdeeds that was one justification for affirmative action and frankly i think that's the justification that has always been the predominant justification whether people owned up to it or not but that's one justification the distributive justice justification is is there like i say you know people we want an integrated america we want an america that looks like america in that justification legitimacy is sometimes mentioned so for instance people will say things like well you know if we're gonna in the armed forces you can't have an armed forces in which the you know the sort of the the the people on the ground are you have a lot of people on the ground who are people of color but none of the people calling the shots none of the generals none of the may you know colonels are people of color no and then you know the the the people on the ground are not gonna stand for that so for purpose of legitimation we need to for for purposes of buy in we need to have a situation in which people get the sense that even if they're sort of low down they're still part of the story they're part of the team so that's part of the sort of you know dis you know i don't know distributive justice notion do you think there's power to that i mean do do you think there's value there's correctness to that kind of idea i think there's some because for the application process for different universities i think that that's probably a driving narrative the justification for for well affirmative action i don't know where we put dei efforts because they overlap but they're not perfectly overlapping the reason that the school so yeah as you know there is a case it'll we'll know about it it'll be announced sometime in the next month well month month and a half there's a case of the supreme court of the united states in which the affirmative action program at harvard and the affirmative action program at the university of north carolina are being challenged most people think including me that the supreme court of the united states is going to limit if not totally seek to abolish affirmative action so this is a very burning issue as things currently stand my university and other universities embrace affirmative action on the third ground the diversity ground and what they say is we need affirmative action because affirmative action is good for pedagogical reasons now frankly do i think there's something to that i think there's a little something to that with respect to some subjects i don't think that's what's really going on for the most part i mean if that's what's really going on why why why don't we have more foreign students you know why why why isn't there a greater effort to bring in more foreign students why isn't there a greater effort to bring in more i don't know religious fundamentalists why isn't there a greater effort to bring in and you could just name various groups that are you know you hardly ever see them on campus so you don't think this kind of effort of driving towards diversity is rigorous enough i think it's often pretextual i think frankly the real reason has to do with the belief and i think it's a good belief i associate myself with the belief it's it's just that because of the legal rules the authorities can't say this belief out loud but it's still the case that a lot of institutions want to help american society overcome its racial past that's the real animating force now this thing about you know we'll have better classroom discussions you know some discussions i mean you know with some subjects yeah hey listen i'm you know i'm an ignoramus when it comes to physics my sense of it is however that if you're talking about physics you're talking about physics and frankly it doesn't much matter in terms of mastering physics what the demographics of that classroom are like you know you you either know physics or you don't the interesting thing i've noticed since doing this podcast is one way it does matter it's really lonely when you do a thing and you don't see somebody that looks like you doing that thing okay and it it's such a seemingly stupid thing why does it matter if there's another person that looks like you mhmm in this very shallow sense but it seems to matter to people and when i talk to for example women on this podcast a lot of women reach out saying how inspiring that is and that's interesting right like i i think we're still human and we see people that look like us and this kind of narrow shallow definition of diversity still matters okay well you know i think i think i think you've made a good point and maybe so so let's go back to the physics i mean let's suppose that under one scenario there's a classroom and a kid sticks his head you know black kid sticks his head in the classroom and doesn't see anybody else black there and has to make a quick decision and says yeah you know nah this ain't for me versus they stick their head in the classroom they see a smattering of other black people in the classroom they say let me try this and then they try it and it turns out damn it they're you know albert einstein so you know to that extent i can see you know under that scenario maybe it does matter so you know i'll have to recalibrate still those are the three those are the three leading justifications for affirmative action you asked me where do i stand with respect to affirmative action oh no before we get to that are there criticisms are the answer is yes there are criticisms of affirmative action affirmative action is a policy like you know any policy any policy is gonna have some downsides to it and affirmative action is no different does affirmative action have some downsides yes it does have have some downsides so what are they well let me mention a couple one stigma stigma so if if you have an institution that says that it reaches out to give a boost to certain people on a racial basis they're gonna be people who observe that and who were gonna be thinking to themselves if so and so is here and they were given a special boost doesn't that mean that they were not as proficient as the other people who are here and who did not have that boost so if they are not as proficient that means that they might not be as good they might not be as up to snuff is that part of our affirmative action world yes it's part of our affirmative action world yes i'm a professor at harvard law school one of the subjects i teach is contracts actually that's probably the subject i most enjoy teaching i think i most enjoy writing about racial conflict and the legal system but as far as teaching i most enjoy teaching contracts well on that very first day on the very first day when i you know eighty students come they're especially you know first year students they're you know nervous i show up i'm quite sure that there's some students there who are thinking okay well is this guy as good as my other teachers because you know i know that you know institutions like harvard have made a special effort to bring in people like this guy kennedy is he as good well i mean i'm sorry if you have an affirmative action regime people are gonna think that and are they crazy to think that no they're not crazy to think that what do you no that's a perfectly logical thing for somebody to think does it does it have an effect on me as the teacher yeah actually it does have an effect on me sure i'm aware that some people are thinking that it doesn't i'm not you know it it doesn't it doesn't you know make me shake in my boots am i aware of it yeah i'm aware of it does it have an effect yeah it probably does have an effect it probably does it probably it probably makes me it probably makes me redouble my efforts because i don't want anybody to think justifiably mhmm that i'm less able than my colleagues so you know it's one of it's funny when i was growing up my father used to tell me over and over again randy tie tie you lose okay brother let me just tell you that and he was telling me that because when he was you know in in an earlier time tie tie you lose it was you know if it's even and there's a choice to be made the white person is gonna get the benefit of the doubt now under affirmative action there's been a switcheroo oftentimes it's the black person who gets the benefit of the doubt but i'm still in a situation in which to work hard yes to avoid the stigmatization yeah that is imposed by affirmative action but is that stigma there yes it's there it is there i'll tell you another way in which it comes up from a student's point of view i'll never forget this it was in my second year of law school it was in tax class we had a very famous tax teacher wonderful tax teacher on the very first day of class professor bittker wonderful man wonderful teacher boris bittker called on the very first person he called on was a black student i remember this as if it were yesterday called on a black student it was a black woman student and i remember when he called on her i remember just i felt i i i felt as if the room got quieter really i felt as if the room got quieter and i know there was a real tenseness within me he didn't call on me he could just call on somebody else it was a black woman student and i felt different i felt as if i was i felt as if i was somehow at issue i felt as if my place i felt as if my status was you know some small degree at issue in a positive direction or the negative just at issue at issue and so now the all of this is happening really quickly he calls on the student this is you know happening like in seconds yeah and she responded and she responded really strongly it was clear she he asked her a question she answered the question she answered the question you know beautif i mean you know very strong comprehensive wonderful response now you might say okay well you know smart student okay fine next after class after class i went up to her and i clearly remember this i said that was great thank you why because a black student predominantly white institution yale law school and i felt some of the again you know affirmative action i felt some of the burden of this affirmative action stigma so it was almost like a a thank you for showing that we belong here yes perfect boom yes that's exactly what the situation and by the way i look i wasn't the only one it i wasn't being idiosyncratic i wasn't the only one there weren't many black people in that class but all of us mhmm and we laughed about it later yeah we laughed about it but that was there so there's there's the stigma issue and some people have made a lot of this some people have really made a lot of the stigma issue my attitude towards the stigma issue yeah it's there it's you know again it's it's part of you know it's part of the situation but i think that the benefits outweigh the burdens but is that a burden yeah that's a burden what are some others resentment yeah resentment in society and that's a you know so in these in the fancy schools and by the way you know remember when we're talking about affirmative action most colleges and universities in the united states there there is no affirmative action issue because they're not selective hell they'll take anybody who you know if you can pay come on in it's only a fairly small set of schools that are selective but of course those are the most elite schools those are the schools that people most want to get into and that's one of the reasons why we have all this you know fighting over those schools now you know there's a whole how many millions of people are there in america who have applied to various places they didn't get in and what do they say the white person who applied to harvard applied to yale applied to columbia you know applied to georgetown applied to nyu you could go you know didn't get in what do they say i would have gotten in if it hadn't been for that racial affirmative action they're resentful well you know should they be resentful no they shouldn't be resentful but they are resentful does that have a consequence yeah it has a consequence it has a consequence on how they act towards other people it has a consequence on how they vote it has a consequence and you know that's that's something are there other things yeah and you know in my book i i i have a you know i go through various i think that i think that there is a i think that there is a certain sort of denialism that has accompanied the affirmative action debate so because you know black people like myself want to avoid the stigmatizing burden of affirmative action there's some people who to deal with that have said oh actually there is no difference between you know the beneficiaries of affirmative action and the other kids there is no difference if if the affirmative action kids got let's say a five hundred and the other kids got a seven fifty that doesn't make any difference that's just bs they're you know the only reason the kid who you know the five fifty kid didn't get seven fifty is because the test asks all sorts of you know biased culturally biased things like you know what is a yacht mhmm well sorry yes there is a difference there's a two hundred point difference does the difference matter yes the difference matters and by the way if you don't know what a yacht is not you can know what a yacht is without owning a yacht okay mhmm and there's this denialism that i think has really seeped into not just the you know in in into various conversations that can have a slippery slope effect as beyond just this yes and you know we see it in various ways so you know this this you know this attack on testing it's not like i'm holding the you know you know some tests are not good tests i think we should be skeptical of everything but there are a lot of tests that yeah they tell us something alright they tell us who knows what and there's some people who are really you know dead set against testing because they're dead set against anything that might show a gap mhmm well i think by the way you know are there gaps yeah there are gaps and what we need to do is be cognizant of those gaps and do things to make it so that if there's a gap if you're if you're deficient no no shame in being deficient heck i'm deficient about a lot of things let's you know let's learn so that i catch up but others you know but i think sometimes there have been people who've been afraid of even acknowledging the gaps of course there's i guess a colleague of yours michael sandel with with tyranny and merit there's interesting rigorous ways to kinda challenge ways on the flip side of that we're obsessing with merit can go wrong also yes you mentioned michael sandel he's a a a a wonderful colleague and he's a wonderful friend i've known him a long time i think he makes very important arguments about meritocracy i disagree with some of the points that he makes about meritocracy so you lean towards the the importance of meritocracy i think that yes i think that i think that there are values in meritocracy extremely important that in fact you know the the the movement from you know feudalism the movement from status the the the the idea of you know i don't you know i don't care who your you know father or mother was i don't care from what part of town you come from i don't care what your last name is i don't care what your color of your skin is show me what you can do mhmm and then somebody sits down okay i'll show you what you can do you know what i can do and they show it you're in yeah i think there's a lot to that and you know the the impulse the sentiments behind that i'm i i i resonate with that i think that there's a lot there what i wanna do is i wanna get rid of those features in society that deprive people of the the what you need to develop yourself you know sometimes those are psychological sometimes it's you know you're not around people who've done things that give you the idea that you can do things i wanna get rid of that but the idea of you know people the idea by the way of you know distinguishing you know this is excellent and the people who are excellent you know they're they're here and then there are people who are good are they excellent no they're not excellent they're good i wanted i wanted i'm not gonna you know close my eyes to that distinction and highlight that distinction and yet at the same time maintain a sense that their basic worth as a human being is equal yes so to you know was it run dmc what are the rap groups no you know we're all written down on the same list yeah we're all written down on the same list yes we're you know so i wanna recognize our fundamental humanity i don't think that that i think that one can recognize our fundamental humanity and one can also recognize as far as i'm concerned that we all collectively should make sure that we we do all that we can to prevent people from sinking below a certain level and being you know in misery i'm you know all for that but i wanna be careful about some of the attacks that i hear on meritocracy so some of the people including again i i have all the respect in the world for for for for for for for michael sandel he you know he talks about the the the arrogance of the winners mhmm okay i wanna be you know i i i don't want the winners to be arrogant that's right luck has a lot to do with things you know you were you you didn't have any control over the circumstances in which you were born into you were lucky that you were born healthy and that you were born with a you know well working mind you didn't have anything to do with that that was pure luck there's some people who don't have that luck so don't you know you know don't be you know mister big stuff okay so i'm you know i'm against that sort of arrogance you know i'm entitled as if as if i taught myself how to read no you didn't teach yourself how to read there was people who did all sorts of things for you and you don't even know it okay so you know i wanna you know get rid of the arrogance have have decent humility i'm all for that at the same time you know i wanna be careful about the problem of envy i wanna be prob i wanna be careful about the problem of resentment i wanna be i wanna be careful about you know i i've heard you know so let's not have let's not give a trophy to the person who wins the race because to give a trophy to to the person who wins the race will make the person who they defeated feel bad no no no um-mm no i don't want that i wanna give a trophy to the person who wins the race because i think it's a good thing to valorize the best yeah it's a it's a a kind of celebration of this whole human project that we're on yes it's celebrating the best you mentioned your father several times so let me just linger on that what what have you learned from what have you learned about life from your father there's i've been just such a lucky person i mean i i i i feel like i've just lived an absolutely charmed life and i i live i mean the work that i do is what i love doing i would pay to do what i am paid to do yeah i mean it's it's you know it's it's great and i've been i've been fortunate in so many ways and one way in which i've been fortunate is my parents my parents rachel spann kennedy henry harold kennedy my mother born in columbia south carolina my father from new orleans louisiana they were refugees from the jim crow south they were people who put their all into their children i have an older brother i have a younger sister all three of us know beyond you know beyond any controversy that we were loved and dearly loved by our parents and they were great people my father very interesting man very independent minded he was perfectly willing to go his own way and i learned much from him including i learned i learned things from him even when i ultimately disagreed with him so for instance again to go back to his pessimism yeah he was pessimistic thoroughly pessimistic but he was also he was also willing to change in certain ways in fact both my parents i mean one of the most important things that happened to my parents was that i'd say when i was let's say ten years old i was born in nineteen fifty four so in nineteen sixty four in nineteen sixty four i think my parents would have taken the position that you definitely never under any circumstances trust a white person if a black person trusts a white person that person is a fool do not trust white people alright they are not to be trusted and it's the highly highly highly unusual one who is not prejudiced okay so white people are not to be trusted and you know by and large they're gonna be your enemy alright so let's just face that that's that's was their their point of view i'd say that i'd say that ten years later that point of view had been leavened somewhat i think and you know you say well what happened in those ten years well certainly in my life one of the things that happened in in those ten years is i i was a student in various schools and i had a series of teachers i've had wonderful black teachers i've also had wonderful white teachers and my parents paid attention to who my teachers were and how my teachers treated me and i think that they were affected by the way in which there were white people who really helped me and were on my side and we're thoroughly on my side and i think that that experience changed my parents in their general view they you know skeptical yeah but they were the the the the possibility the possibility of a white person genuinely being the friend of a black person that they they they that became alive to them and i give them a lot of credit because they were they were adults and you know for an adult to change that's a big deal but my my parents did change in that transformation that was inspiring to you was formative to you in terms of joining the optimist camp hugely and you know the the the school i mean i again you know i said a moment ago how lucky i've been heck i teach at i teach at harvard law school i attended balliol college oxford i got my law degree from yale law school i got my undergraduate degree at princeton university those are some pretty good schools they all were they all were the most important school however that i attended the school that made the most difference in my education was my high school saint albans school saint albans school for boys and at saint albans i encountered a cadre of teachers and by the way at saint albans when i went to saint albans all these teachers were white all of these teachers there was there was one the the the the the the head of athletics very important man very impressive man brooks johnson was black otherwise white teachers and these teachers made a huge difference in my life and you know i can call their names boom boom boom boom boom the greatest of them all was a man by the name of jack mccune yeah we called him gentleman jack gentleman jack mccune and what subject did he teach he taught me history he was my advanced placement history teacher but john f mccune and we shared a birthday john f mccune was a fabulously good teacher and we developed a deep lifetime friendship i was with mister mccune the day before he died and you know he was a white man and i've had other teachers who've some of whom have become colleagues of mine you know sanford levinson sanford levinson was a teacher of mine at princeton he's become a colleague of mine i mean it it would be frankly it would be impossible for me to you know i hear i can't make some sort of you know sort of blanket condemnation of white people with sandy levinson in my life i mean it'd be seriously with john f macuna in my life with eric foner in my life with my colleague martha minow in my life my colleague cass sunstein in my life impossible you know that speaks of the power of teachers and mentors oh yeah and you're that to a lot of people well i i've i've taken that to i hope i hope listen i would be i would listen i would be absolutely overjoyed if there was a student who thought of me in the way that i think of gentleman jack mccune if there if if if that's the case just one just one if that's the case i'm overjoyed that's a that's a life well lived what do you think of martin luther king's i have a dream do you still share that dream i think that martin luther king junior's i have a dream speech is one of the great speeches not only in american history but in the history of the world you know there's there's a tendency now for people to sort of pooh pooh that speech i think unfortunately the speech you know has been embraced by you know advertisers and corporate america it's been it's been so you know it's it's been it's been heard so many times that it it sort of has been made to suffer from what some people might view as overexposure it's so unfortunate i mean it's too bad when when especially when hollywood rolls in they did that with john lennon's imagine recently which i think is one of the greatest songs ever and the actors and actresses ruined it by trying to like sing along and do this kind of cliche hollywood thing it has but people have tried to make it into a cliche the fact of the matter is it's the the the sentiment the sentiment behind i have a dream yeah i'll associate myself with that and anybody wants to anybody wants to see some great oratory go watch and you know martin luther king junior i mean he he gave he gave you know several great speeches you know his first speech the first speech that he gave as a civil rights leader the holt street baptist church nineteen fifty five at the beginning of the montgomery bus boycott which was virtually an extemporaneous speech was one of his greatest and he was he was i think twenty six years old great his last speech you know his mountaintop speech great speech but i have a dream i love it i will associate myself with those sentiments any day of the week absolutely so there's still hope for a deep kind of multiracial a deep unity in the twenty first century hope and i think that the i think the sentiments that martin luther king junior expressed in august nineteen sixty three that represents the best of american life and i think it's a you know do i want to see that come to pass yeah i wanna see that come to pass and we'll we'll work to you know push that project along as as far as it'll go well thank you for carrying his spirit of optimism forward the spirit of your mother and father thank you for all the amazing work you've done and thank you for just this conversation is a huge honor this is awesome thank you really appreciate it thank you randall thanks for listening to this conversation with randall kennedy to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from martin luther king junior darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
