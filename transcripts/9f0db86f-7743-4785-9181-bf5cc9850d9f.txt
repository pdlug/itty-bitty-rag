sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's jimmy wales let's start at the beginning what is the origin story of wikipedia the origin story of wikipedia well so i was watching the growth of the free software movement open source software and seeing programmers coming together to collaborate in new ways sharing code doing that under a free license which is really interesting because it empowers an ability to work together that's really hard to do if the code is still proprietary because then if i chip in and help we sort of have to figure out how i'm gonna be rewarded and and what that is but the idea that everyone can copy it and and it just is part of the commons really empowered a huge wave of creative software production and i realized that that kind of collaboration could extend beyond just software to all kinds of cultural works and the first thing that i thought of was an encyclopedia and i thought oh that seems obvious that an encyclopedia you can collaborate on it there's a few reasons why one we all pretty much know what an encyclopedia entry on say the eiffel tower should be like you should see a picture a few pictures maybe history location something about the architect etc etc so we have a shared understanding of what it is we're trying to do and then we can collaborate and different people can chip in and find sources and so on and so forth so set up first newpedia which was about two years before wikipedia and with newpedia we we had this idea that in order to be respected we had to be even more academic than a traditional encyclopedia because a bunch of volunteers on the internet getting out of the right an encyclopedia you know you could be made fun of if it's just every random person so we had implemented this seven stage review process to get anything published and two two things came of that so one thing one of the earliest entries that we published after this rigorous process a few days later we had to pull it because as soon as it hit the web and the broader community took a look at it people noticed plagiarism and realized that it it wasn't actually that good even though it had been reviewed by academics and so on so we had to pull it so it's like oh okay well so much for a seven stage review process but also i decided that i wanted to try i was frustrated why is this taking so long why is it so hard so i thought oh okay i saw that robert merton had won nobel prize in economics for his work on option pricing theory and when i was in academia that's what i worked on was option pricing theory had a published paper so i'd worked through all of his academic papers and i knew his work quite well i thought oh i'll just i'll write a short biography of merton and when i started to do it i'd been out of academia hadn't been a grad student for a few years then i felt this huge intimidation because they were gonna take my draft and send it to the most prestigious finance professors that we could find to give me feedback for revisions and it felt like being back in grad school you know it's like this really oppressive sort of like you're gonna submit it for review and you're gonna get critiques a little bit of the bad part of grad school yeah yeah the bad part of grad school right and so i was like oh this isn't intellectually fun this is like the bad part of grad school yeah it's intimidating and and there's a lot of you know potential embarrassment if i screw something up and so forth and so that was when i realized okay look this is never gonna work this is not something that people are really gonna wanna do so jeremy rosenfeld one of my employees had brought and showed me the wiki concept in december and then larry sanger brought in the same said hey what about this wiki idea and so in january we decided to launch wikipedia but we weren't sure so the the original project was called nupedia and even though it wasn't successful we did have quite a group of academics and like really serious people and we were concerned that oh maybe these academics are gonna really hate this idea and we shouldn't just convert the project immediately we should launch this as a side project the idea of here's a wiki where we can start playing around but actually we got more work done in two weeks than we had in almost two years because people were able to just jump on and start doing stuff and it was actually a very exciting time you know you could back then you could be the first person who typed africa is a continent and hit save which isn't much of an encyclopedia entry but it's true and it's a start and it's kind of fun you put your name down actually a funny story was several years later i just happened to be online and i saw when his name is robert allman won the nobel prize in economics and we didn't have an entry on him at all which was surprising but it wasn't that surprising this was still early days you know and so i got to be the first person to type robert oman won nobel prize in economics and hit save which again wasn't a very good article but then i came back two days later and people had improved it and so forth so that that second half of the experience where with robert merton i never succeeded because it was just too intimidating it was like oh no i was able to chip in and help other people jumped in everybody was interested in the topic because it's all in the news at the moment and so it's just a completely different model which worked much much better what what is it that made that so accessible so fun so so natural to just add something well i i think it's you know especially in the early days and this by the way has gotten much harder because there are fewer topics that are just greenfield you know available but you know you you could say oh well you know i i know a little bit about this and i can i can get it started but then it is fun to to come back then and see other people have added and improved and so on and so forth and that idea of collaborating you know where people can much like open source software you know you put your code out and then people suggest revisions and they change it and it and it modifies and it grows beyond the original creator it's just like kind of a fun wonderful quite geeky hobby but people enjoy it how much debate was there over the interface over the details of how to make that seamless and frictionless yeah i mean not as much as there probably should have been in a way during that two years of the failure of nupedia where very little work got done what was actually productive was there was a huge long discussion email discussion very clever people talking about things like neutrality talking about what is an encyclopedia but also talking about more technical ideas you know things back then xml was kind of all the rage and thinking about could we shouldn't you have certain data that might be in multiple articles that gets updated automatically so for example you know the population of new york city every ten years there's a new official census couldn't you just update update that bit of data in one place and it would update across all loads that is a reality today but back then it was just like how do we do that how do we think about that so that is a reality today where it's yeah there there's some yeah so wikipedia variables wiki data yeah wiki data you can you can link you know from a wikipedia entry you can link to that piece of data in wikidata i mean it's a pretty advanced thing but there are advanced users who are doing that and then when when that gets updated it updates in all the languages where you've done that i mean that's really interesting there was this chain of emails in the early days of discussing the details of what is so there's the interface there's the yeah so the interface so an example there was some software called usemodwiki which we started with quite amusing actually because the main reason we launched with use modwiki is that it was a single perl script so it was really easy for me to install it on the server and just get running but it was you know some guy's hobby project it was cool but it was just a hobby project and all the data was stored in flat text files so there was no real database behind it so to search the site you basically used grab which is just like basic unix utility to like look through all the files so that clearly was never gonna scale but also in the early days it didn't have real logins so you could set your username but there were no passwords so you know i might say bob smith and then someone else comes along and says no i'm bob smith and they both had it now that never really happened we didn't have a problem with it but it was kind of obvious like you can't grow a big website where everybody can pretend to be everybody that's not gonna be good for trust and reputation and so forth so quickly i had to write a little you know log in you know store people's passwords and things like that so you could have unique identities and then another example of something you know quite you would have never thought would have been a good idea and it turned out to not be a problem but to make a link in wikipedia in the early days you would make a link to a page that may or may not exist by just using camel case meaning it's like uppercase lowercase and you smash the words together so maybe new york city you might type n e w no space capital y york city and that would make a link but that was ugly that was clearly not right and so i was like okay well that that's just not gonna look nice let's just use square brackets two square brackets makes a link and that may have been an option in the software i'm not sure i thought up square brackets but anyway we just did that which worked really well it makes nice links and you know you can see and it's red links or blue links depending on if the page exists or not but the thing that didn't occur to me even think about is that for example on the german language standard keyboard there is no square bracket so for german wikipedia to succeed people had to learn to do some alt codes to get the square bracket or they a lot of users cut and paste a square bracket when they could find one and they would just cut and paste one in and yep german wikipedia has been a massive success so somehow that didn't slow people down how is that that the german keyboards don't have a square bracket how do you do programming how do you how do you live life to its fullest without that's a very good question i'm not really sure i mean maybe it does now because keyboard standards have you know drifted over time and becomes useful to have a certain character i mean it's same thing like there's not really a w character in italian yeah and it wasn't on keyboards or i think it is now but in in general w is not a letter in italian language but it appears in enough international words that it's crept into italian so and all of these things are probably wikipedia articles in in oh yeah themselves oh yeah the discussion of square brackets old discussion i'm sure on both the english and the and the german wikipedia and and the difference between those two might be very very interesting so wikidata is fascinating but even the broader discussion of what is an encyclopedia can you go to that sort of philosophical question of sure what is what is a what is an encyclopedia what is an encyclopedia so the way i would put it is an encyclopedia or what our goal is is as the sum of all human knowledge but sum meaning summary so and this was an early debate i mean somebody started uploading the full text of hamlet for example and we said wait hold on a second that's not an encyclopedia article but why not so hence was born wikisource which is where you put original text and things like that out of copyright text because they said no an encyclopedia article about hamlet that's a perfectly valid thing but the actual text of the play is not an an encyclopedia article so most of it's fairly obvious but there are some interesting quirks and and differences so for example as i understand it in french language encyclopedias traditionally it would be quite common to have recipes which in english language that would be unusual you wouldn't find a recipe for chocolate cake in britannica and so i actually don't know the current state i haven't even thought about that in mhmm many many years now state of cake recipes in wikipedia in english wikipedia i wouldn't say there's chocolate cake recipes i mean you might find a sample recipe somewhere i'm not saying they're non but in general no like we wouldn't have recipes i told myself i would not get outraged in this conversation but now i'm outraged i'm deeply upset it's actually very complicated i'm i'm i love to cook i'm i'm you know i'm i'm actually quite a good cook and what's interesting is there's it's very hard to have a neutral recipe because like a canonical recipe for a canonical recipe is is kind of difficult to come by because there's so many variants and it's all debatable and interesting for something like chocolate cake you could probably say here's one of the earliest recipes or here's one of the most common recipes but for many many things the variants are as interesting you know as you know somebody said to me recently you know ten spaniards twelve paella recipes so you know these are all matters of open discussion well just to throw some numbers as of may twenty seventh twenty twenty three there are six million six point six six million articles in the english wikipedia containing over four point three billion words including articles the total number of pages is fifty eight million yeah does that blow your mind i mean yes it does i mean it doesn't because i i know those numbers and see them from time to time but in another sense a deeper sense yeah it does i mean it's really remarkable i remember when english wikipedia passed one hundred thousand articles and when german wikipedia passed one hundred thousand because i happened to be in germany with a bunch of wikipedians that night and you know then it seemed quite big i mean we knew at that time that it it was nowhere near complete i remember at wikimania in harvard when we when we did our annual conference there in boston someone who had come to the conference from poland had brought along with him a small encyclopedia a single volume encyclopedia of biographies so short biographies normally a paragraph or so about famous people in poland and there were some twenty two thousand entries and he pointed out that even then two thousand and six wikipedia felt quite big and he said in english wikipedia there's only a handful of these you know less than ten percent i think he said and so then you realized yeah actually you know who was the mayor of warsaw in eighteen seventy three don't know probably not in english wikipedia but it probably might be today but there's so much out there and of course what we get into when we're talking about how many entries there are and how many you know how many could there be is this very deep philosophical issue of notability which is the question of well how do you how do you draw the limit how do you draw you know what what is there so sometimes people say oh there should be no limit but i think that doesn't stand up to much scrutiny if you really pause and think about it so i see in your hand there you've got a bic pen mhmm pretty standard everybody's seen you know billions of those in life classic though it's a classic clear bic pen so could we have an entry about that bic pen well i bet we do that type of bic pen because it's classic everybody knows it and it's got a history and actually there's something interesting about the bic company they make pens they also make kayaks mhmm and there's something else they're framed so basically they're they're sort of a a definition by non essentials company anything that's long and plastic that's what they make wow so if you wanna find the form the platonic form of a bic but could we have an article about that very bic pen in your hand mhmm so lex fridman's bic pen as of this week very specific instance and the answer is no there's not much known about it i dare say unless you know it's very special to you and your great grandmother gave it to you or something you probably know very little about it it's a pen it's just here in the office and so that that's just to show there's a there's there is a limit i mean in german wikipedia they used to talk about the the rear knot of the wheel of ullie fuchs bicycle ullie fuchs the well known wikipedian of the time to sort of illustrate that you can't have an article about literally everything and so then it raises the question what can you have an article about what can't you and that can vary depending on the subject matter one of the areas where we try to be much more careful would be biographies the reason is a biography of a living person if you get it wrong it can actually be quite hurtful quite damaging and so if someone is a private person and somebody tries to create a wikipedia intro there's no way to update it there's not much now so for example an encyclopedia article about my mother my mother school teacher later a pharmacist wonderful woman but never been in the news i mean other than me talking about why there shouldn't be a wikipedia entry that's probably made it in somewhere standard example but you know there's not enough known and you could sort of imagine a a database of genealogy having date of birth date of death and you know some certain elements like that of of private people but you couldn't really buy write a biography one of the areas this comes up quite often is what we call blp one a we've got lots of acronyms biography of a living person who's notable for only one event is a real sort of danger zone and the type of example would be a victim of a crime so someone who's a victim of a famous serial killer but about whom like really not much is known they weren't a public person they're just a victim of a crime we really shouldn't have an article about that person they'll be mentioned of course and maybe the specific crime might have an article but for that person no not really that's not really something that makes any sense because how can you write a biography about someone you don't know much about and this is you know it it varies from from field to field so for example for many academics we will have an entry that we might not have in a different context because for an academic it's important to have sort of their career what papers they've published things like that you may not know anything about their personal life but that's actually not encyclopedically relevant in the same way that it is for a member of a royal family where it's basically all about the family so you know we we we're fairly nuanced about notability and where it comes in and i've always thought that the the term notability i think is a little problematic i mean it's we we we struggle about how to talk about it the problem with notability is it's it can feel insulting so no you're not noteworthy well my mother's noteworthy she's really important person in my life right so that's not right but it's more like verifiability is there a way to to get information that actually makes an encyclopedia entry it so happens that there's a wikipedia page about me as i've learned recently and the first thought i had when i saw that was surely i am not notable enough so i was very surprised and grateful that such a page could exist and actually just allow me to say thank you to all the incredible people that are part of creating and maintaining wikipedia it's my favorite website on the internet the collection of articles that wikipedia has created is just incredible we'll talk about the various details of that but the the love and care that goes into creating pages for individuals for a big pen for all this kind of stuff is just is just really incredible so i just felt the love when i when i saw that page but i also felt just because i do this podcast and i just through this podcast gotten to know a few individuals that are quite controversial mhmm i've gotten to be on the receiving end of something quite to me as a person who loves other human beings i've gone to be at the receiving end of some kind of attacks through the wikipedia mhmm form like you said when you look at living individuals it can be quite hurtful mhmm the little details of information and because i've become friends with elon musk mhmm and i've interviewed him but i've also interviewed people on the left far left people on the right some people would say far right and so now you take a step you put your toe into the cold pool of politics and the shark emerges from the depths and pulls you right in yeah i'd i boiling hot pool politics yeah i guess it's it's hot and so i got to experience some of that i think what you also realize is there has to be for wikipedia kind of credible sources verifiable sources and there's a dance there because some of the sources are pieces of journalism and of course journalism operates under its own complicated incentives mhmm such that people can write articles that are not factual or are cherry picking all the flaws they can have in a journalistic article for sure and those can be used as as as sources it's like they dance hand in hand and so for me sadly enough there was a really kind of concerted attack to say that i was never at mit i never did anything at mit just to clarify i am a research scientist at mit i have been there since twenty fifteen i'm there today i'm at a prestigious amazing laboratory called lids and i hope to be there for a long time i work on ai robotics machine learning there's a lot of incredible people there and by the way mit has been very kind to defend me unlike wikipedia says it is not an unpaid position there was no controversy it was all very calm and happy and almost boring research that i've been doing there and the other thing because i am half ukrainian half russian and i've traveled to ukraine and i will travel to ukraine again and i will travel to russia for some very difficult conversations my heart's been broken by this war i have family in both places it's been a really difficult time but the little battle about the biography there also starts becoming important for the first time for me i also wanna clarify sort of personally use this opportunity of some inaccuracies there my father was not born in shkalisk russia he was born in kyiv ukraine i was born in shkalisk which is a town not in russia there is a town like called that in russia but there's another town in tajikistan which is a former republic of the soviet union it is that town is now called b u s t o n buston which is funny because we're now in austin and i also am in boston it seems like my whole life is surrounded by these kinds of towns yeah so i was born in tajikistan and the rest of the biography is interesting but my family is very evenly distributed between their origins and where they grew up between ukraine and russia which is as a whole beautiful complexity to this whole thing so i wanna just correct that it's like the fascinating thing about wikipedia is in some sense those little details don't matter but in another sense what i felt when i saw a wikipedia page about me or anybody i know is is is there's this beautiful kinda saving that this person existed like a a community that notices you it says like a like a little you see like a like a butterfly that floats and you're like that it's not just any butterfly it's that one i like that one or you see a puppy or something or or it's this big pen this one i remember this one it has this scratch and you get noticed in that way and that i don't know it's a beautiful thing and it's i mean maybe it's very silly of me and naive but i feel like wikipedia in terms of individuals is an opportunity to celebrate people to celebrate ideas for sure and not a battleground of attacks of the kinda stuff we might see on on twitter like the mockery the derision this kind of stuff for sure i and of course you don't wanna cherry pick all of us have flaws and so on but it just feels like to highlight a controversy of some sort mhmm when that doesn't at all represent the entirety of the human yeah in most cases yeah is sad yeah yeah yeah so there's a few things to unpack in all that so first one one of the things i find really always find very interesting is you know your status with mit okay that's that's upsetting and it's an argument and can be sorted out but then what's interesting is you you gave as much time to that which is actually important and relevant to your career and so on to also where your father was born which most people would hardly notice but is really meaningful to you and i find that a lot when i talk to people who have a a biography of wikipedia is they're often as annoyed by a tiny error that no one's gonna notice like this town in tajikistan yeah has got a new name and so on like nobody even knows what that means or whatever but it can be super important and so that's that's one of the reasons you know for biographies we we say like human dignity really matters and so you know some of the things have to do with and this is this is a common debate that goes on in wikipedia is what we call undo wait so i give i'll give an example there was a article i stumbled across many years ago about you know the mayor oh no he wasn't a mayor he was a city council member of i think it was peoria illinois but some small town in in the midwest and the entry you know he's been on the city council for thirty years or whatever he's pretty i mean frankly pretty boring guy and seems like a good local city politician but in this very short biography there was a whole paragraph a long paragraph about his son being arrested for dui and it was clearly undue weight it's like what has this got to do with this guy if it even deserves a mention it wasn't even clear had he done anything hypocritical mhmm had he done himself anything wrong even was his son his son got a dui that's never great but it happens to people and it doesn't seem like a massive scandal for your dad so of course i just took that out immediately this is a long long time ago and that's the sort of thing where you know we have to really think about in a biography and about controversies to say is this a real controversy so in general like one of the things we we tend to say is like any section so if there's a biography mhmm and there's a section called controversies that's actually poor practice because it just invites people to say oh i wanna work on this entry see there's seven sections oh this one's quite short can i add something right go out and find some more controversies no that's nonsense right and in general putting it separate from everything else kind of makes it seem worse and also doesn't put it in the right context whereas if it's sort of a live flow and there is a controversy there's always potential controversy for anyone it should just be sort of worked into the overall article because then it doesn't become a temptation you can contextualize appropriately and so forth so that's you know part of the whole process but i i think for me one of the most important things is is what i call community health so yeah are we gonna get it wrong sometimes yeah of course we're humans and doing good quality you know sort of reference material is hard the real question is how how do people react you know to a criticism or a complaint or a concern and if the reaction is defensiveness or combativeness back or if someone's really sort of in there being aggressive and in the wrong like no no no hold on we've got to do this the right way you got to say okay hold on you know are there good sources is this contextualized appropriately is it even important enough to mention what does it mean and and sometimes one of the the the areas where i do think there is a very complicated flaw and and you've alluded to it a little bit but it's like we know the media is deeply flawed we know that journalism can go wrong and i would say particularly in the last whatever fifteen years we've seen a real decimation of local media and local newspapers we've seen a real rise in clickbait headlines and sort of eager focus on anything that might be controversial we've always had that with us of course there's always been tabloid newspapers but that makes it a little bit more challenging to say okay how do we how do we sort things out when we have a pretty good sense that that not every source is valid so as an example a few years ago it's been quite a while now we deprecated the mail online as a source mhmm and the mail online you know the digital arm of the daily mail it's a tabloid it's not completely you know it's not fake news but it does tend to run very hyped up stories they really love to attack people and go on the attack for political reasons and so on and it just isn't great and so by saying deprecated and i think some people say oh you banned the daily mail no we didn't ban it as a source we just said look it's probably not a great source right you should probably look for a better source so certainly if the daily mail runs a headline saying new cure for cancer it's like probably there's more serious sources than a tabloid newspaper in an article about lung cancer you probably wouldn't cite the daily mail that's kind of ridiculous but also for celebrities and so forth to sort of know well they do cover celebrity gossip a lot but they also tend to have vendettas and so forth and you really have to step back and go is this really encyclopedic or is this just the daily mail going on a rant and some of that requires a great community health like i mean it requires massive community health even for me for stuff i've seen this kind of effectually iffy about people i know things i know about myself i still feel like a a love for knowledge emanating from the article like in like i feel the community helps so i will take all slight inaccuracies i would i i would i love it because that means there's people for the most part i feel a respect and and love in the search for knowledge like sometimes because i also love stack overflow stack exchange for programming related things yeah yeah and they can get a little cranky sometimes to a degree where it's like it's not as like you could see you could feel the dynamics of the health of the particular community yeah and and and subcommunities too like a particular c sharp or java or python or whatever like there's little like communities that emerge you can feel the levels of toxicity because a little bit of strictness is good but a little too much is bad yeah because of the defensiveness because when somebody writes an answer and then somebody else kinda says well modify it and then get defensive and there's this tension that's not conducive to like improving towards a more truthful depiction of like what what on that topic yeah a a great example that i really loved this morning that i saw someone left a note on my user talk page in english wikipedia saying it was quite a dramatic headline thing racist hook on front page so we have on the front page of wikipedia we have little section called did you know and it's just little tidbits and facts just things people find interesting and there's a whole process for how things get there the one that somebody was raising a question about was it was comparing a very well known us football player black there was a quote from another famous sport person comparing him to a lamborghini clearly a compliment and so somebody said actually here's a study here's some interesting information about how black sports people are far more often compared to inanimate objects and given that kind of analogy and i think it's demeaning to compare a person to a car etcetera etcetera but they said i'm not i'm not pulling i'm not deleting it i'm not removing it i just wanna raise the question and then there's this really interesting conversation that goes on where i think the general consensus was you know what this isn't like like the alarming headline racist thing on the front page of wikipedia that sounds holy moly that sounds bad but it's sort of like actually yeah this this probably isn't the sort of analogy that we think is great and so we should probably think about how to improve our language and not not compare sports people to inanimate objects and particularly be aware of certain racial sensitivities that there might be around that sort of thing if there is a disparity in the media of how people are called and i just thought you know what nothing for me to weigh in on here this is a good conversation like nobody's saying you know people should be banned if if they refer to what was his name the fridge refrigerator perry you know very famous comparison to an inanimate object of a chicago bears player many years ago but they're just saying hey let's be careful about analogies that we just pick up from the media i said yeah you know that's good on the sort of deprecation of news sources it's really interesting because i think what you're saying is ultimately you wanna make a article by article decision kind of use your own judgment and it's such a subtle thing because the there's just a lot of hit pieces written about individuals like myself for example that masquerade as kind of an objective thorough exploration of a human being mhmm it's fascinating to watch because controversy and hit pieces just get more clicks oh yeah and this is a i i guess as a wikipedia contributor you start to deeply become aware of that and start to have a sense like a radar of clickbait versus truth like to to pick out the truth from the clickbaity type language oh yeah i mean it's it's really important and you know we we talk a lot about weasel words you know and you know actually i'm sure we'll end up talking about ai and chat gbt but just to quickly mention in this area i think one of the potentially powerful tools because it is quite good at this i've i've played around with and practiced it quite a lot but chatgpt four is is really quite able to to take a passage and point out potentially biased terms to to rewrite it to be more neutral now it is a bit anodyne and it's a bit you know cliched so sometimes it just takes the spirit out of something that's actually not bad it's just like you know poetic language and you're like well okay that's not actually helping but in many cases i think that sort of thing is quite interesting and i'm also interested in you know can you imagine where you you feed in a wikipedia entry and all the sources and you say help me find anything in the article that is not accurately reflecting what's in the sources and that doesn't have to be perfect it only has to be good enough to be useful to community so if if it scans beautiful an article and all the sources and you say oh it came back with ten suggestions and seven of them were decent and three of them it just didn't understand well actually that's probably worth my time to do and it can help us you know really more quickly get good people to sort of review obscure entries and things like that so just as a small aside on that and we'll probably talk about language models a little bit or a lot more but one of the articles one of the hit pieces about me the journalist actually was very straightforward and honest about having used gpt to write part of the article oh interesting and then finding that it made an error and apologized for the error that gpt four generated which has this kind of interesting loop which yeah the articles are used to write wikipedia pages yeah gpt is trained on wikipedia and then there's like this interesting loop where the weasel words and the nuances can get lost or can propagate even though they're not grounded in reality somehow in the generation of the language model new truths can be created and kind of linger yeah there's a a famous webcomic that's titled cytogenesis which is about how something an error is in wikipedia and there's no source for it but then a lazy journalist reads it and writes the source yeah and then some helpful wikipedian spots that it has a source finds a source and adds it to wikipedia and voila magic this happened to me once it it well it nearly happened there there was this i mean it was really brief i went back and researched it i'm like this is really odd so biography magazine which is a magazine published by the biography tv channel had a a profile of me and it said in his spare time i'm not quoting exactly it's been many years but in his spare time he enjoys playing chess with friends i thought wow that sounds great like i would like to be that guy but actually i mean i play chess with my kids sometimes but no i'm not it's not a hobby of mine and i was like where did they get that and i contacted the magazine and said where did that come from they said oh it was in wikipedia and i looked in the history there had been vandalism of wikipedia which was not you know it's not damaging it's mhmm just false so and it had already been removed but then i thought oh gosh well i better mention this to people because otherwise it's somebody's gonna read that and they're gonna add it to the entry and it's gonna take a life of its own and then sometimes i wonder if it has because i've been i was invited a few years ago to do the ceremonial first move in the world chess championship and i thought i wonder if they think i'm a really big chess enthusiast because they read this biography magazine article so but that that problem when we think about large language models and the the ability to quickly generate very plausible but not true content i think is something that there's gonna be a lot of shakeout and a lot of implications of that what would be hilarious is because of the social pressure of wikipedia and the momentum you would actually start playing a lot more chess just and not only the articles are written based on wikipedia but your own life trajectory changes because of the wikipedia just to make it more convenient yeah aspire to aspire to yes yeah but aspirations are what if if we could just talk about that before we jump back to some other interesting topics in wikipedia let's talk about gpt foreign large language models so they are in part trained on wikipedia content yeah what are the pros and cons of of these language models what are your thoughts yeah so i mean there's a lot of stuff going on obviously the technology has moved very quickly in the last six months and looks poised to do so for some time to come so first things first part of our philosophy is the open licensing the free licensing the idea that you know this is what we're here for we are a volunteer community and we write this encyclopedia we give it to the world to do what you like with you can modify it redistribute it redistribute modified versions commercially non commercially this is this is the licensing so in that sense of course it's completely fine now we do worry a bit about attribution because it is a creative commons attribution share alike license so attribution is important not just because of our licensing model and things like that but it's just proper attribution is just good intellectual practice and so and that's a really hard complicated question you know if if i were to write something about my visit here i might say in a blog post you know i was in austin which is a city in texas i'm not gonna put a source for austin as a city in texas that's just general knowledge i learned it somewhere i can't tell you where so you don't have to cite and reference every single thing but you know if i actually did research and i use something very heavily it's just proper morally proper to give your sources so we would like to see that and obviously you know they call it grounding so particularly people at google are really keen on figuring out grounding such a cool term so ground any any text that's generated trying to ground it to the wikipedia quality a source source i mean like yeah the same kind of standard of what a source means that wikipedia uses mhmm the same kind of source generated yeah but with regards the same kind of thing and of course one of the biggest flaws in chatgpd right now is that it just literally will make things up just to be amiable i think it's programmed to be very hopeful and amiable and doesn't really know or care about the truth you can get bullied into yeah it can kinda be convinced into at least well but like this morning i i was i the story i was telling earlier about comparing a football player to a lamborghini and i thought oh is that really racial i don't know i'm just i'm mulling it over and i thought i'm gonna go to chat gpt so i sent to chat gpt four i said you know this this happened in wikipedia can you think of examples where a white athlete has been compared to a fast car inanimate object and it comes back with a very plausible essay where it tells you know why these analogies are common in sport blah blah blah i said no no i really could you give me some specific examples so so it gives me three specific examples very plausible correct names of athletes and contemporaries and all of that could have been true googled every single quote and none of them existed yeah and so i'm like well that's really not good like i i wanted to explore a thought process i was in i thought i thought first i thought how do i google and it's like well it's kind of a hard thing to google because unless somebody's written about this specific topic it's you know it's large language model it can it's processed all this data it can probably piece that together for but it just can't yet so i think i hope that gpt five six seven you know three to five years i'm hoping we'll see a much higher you know level of accuracy where when you ask a question like that i i think instead of being quite so eager to please by giving you a plausible sounding answer it's just say don't know or maybe display the how much bullshit might be in this generated text like i i'm really would like to make you happy right now but i'm really stretched thin with this general it's it's one of the things i i've said for a long time so in in wikipedia one of the great things we do may not be great for our reputation except in a deeper sense for the long term i think it is but there'll be a notice that says the neutrality of this section has been disputed or the following section doesn't cite in these sources and i always joke you know sometimes i wish the new york times would run a a banner saying the neutrality of this has been disputed they could give us a we had a big fight in the newsroom as to whether to run this or not but we thought it's important enough to bring it to but but just be aware that not all the journalists are on board with it ah that's actually interesting and that's fine i would trust them more for that level of transparency so yeah similarly chachibuty should say yeah eighty seven percent bullshit well the neutrality one is really interesting because that's basically a summary of the discussions that are going on underneath it would be amazing if like i i should be honest i don't look at the talk page often i don't it would be nice somehow if there was a kind of a summary in the in this banner way of like this lots of wars have been fought on this here land for this here paragraph it's really interesting yeah i hadn't thought of that because we one of the things i do spend a lot of time thinking about these days and you know people have found that we're moving slowly but you know we are moving thinking about okay these tools exist are there ways that this stuff can be useful to our community because a part of it is we do approach things in a non commercial way in a really deep sense it's like it's been great that wikipedia has become very popular but really we're just we're a community whose hobby is writing an encyclopedia that's first and if it's popular great if it's not okay we might have trouble paying for more servers but it'll be fine and so how do we help the community use these tools what are the ways that these tools can support people and one example i never thought about i'm gonna start playing with it is you know feed in the article and feed in the talk page and say can you suggest some warnings in the article based on the conversations in the talk page i think it might might be good at that it might get it wrong sometimes but again if it's reasonably successful at doing that and you can say oh actually yeah it does suggest you know the neutrality of this has been disputed on a section that has a seven page discussion in the back that might be useful don't know we're playing with i mean some more color to the not neutrality but also the amount of emotion laden in the exploration of this particular part of the topic yeah it it might it might actually help you look at more controversial pages like on you know a page on war in ukraine or a page on israel and palestine there could be parts that everyone agrees on and there's parts that are just like tough tough the hard parts yeah and it's it would be nice to when looking at those beautiful long mhmm articles to know like alright let me just take in some stuff where everybody agrees on i could give an example that i haven't looked at in a long time but i was really pleased with what i saw at the time so the discussion was that they're building something in israel and for their own political reasons one side calls it a wall hearkening back to berlin wall apartheid the other calls it a security fence so we can understand quite quickly if we give it a moment's thought like okay i understand why people would have this this grappling over the language like okay you want to highlight the negative aspects of this and you want to highlight the positive aspects so you're going to try and choose a different name and so there was this really fantastic wikipedia discussion on the talk page how do we word that paragraph to talk about the different naming it's called this by israelis it's called this by palestinians and that how you explain that to people could be quite charged right you could easily explain oh there's this difference and it's because this side's good and this side's bad and that's why there's a difference or you could say actually let's just let's try and really stay as neutral as we can and try to explain the reason so you may come away from it with with a concept oh okay i understand what this debate is about now and just the term israel palestine conflict is still the title of a page a wikipedia but the word conflict is something that is a charged word of course yeah because from the palestinian side or from certain sides the word conflict doesn't accurately describe the situation because if you see it as a genocide one way genocide is not a conflict because to that to to people that discuss the that challenge the word conflict they see you know conflict is when there's two equally powerful sides fighting yeah yeah no it's it's hard and you know in in a number of cases so this is this actually speaks to a slightly broader phenomenon which is there are a number of cases where there is no one word that can give consensus and in the body of an article that's usually okay because we can explain the whole thing you can come away with an understanding of why each side wants to use a certain word but there are some aspects of it like the page has to have a title so you know there's that same thing with certain things like photos you know it's like well there's different photos which one's best a lot of different views on that but at the end of the day you need the lead photo because there's one slot for a lead photo categories is another one so at one point i have no idea if it's in there today but i don't think so i was listed in you know kind of american entrepreneurs fine american atheists and i said i don't that doesn't feel right to me like just personally it's true i mean i wouldn't wouldn't disagree with the objective fact of it but when you click the category and you see sort of a lot of people who are you might say american atheist activist because that's their big issue so madeline murray o'hare or various famous people who richard dawkins who make it a big part of their public argument and persona but that's not true of me it's just like my private personal belief it doesn't really it's not something i campaign about so it felt weird to put me in the category but like what category would you put you know and and do you need that in this case i was i argued that doesn't need that kind of like that's not i don't speak about it publicly except incidentally from time to time i don't campaign about it so it's weird to put me with this group of people and that argument carried the day i hope not just because it was me but but categories can be like that where you know you're either in the category or you're not and sometimes it's a lot more complicated than that and and is it again we go back to is it undue weight you know if someone who is now prominent in public life and generally considered to be a good person was convicted of something let's say dui when they were young we normally in normal sort of discourse we don't think oh this person should be in the category of american criminals because you think oh criminal technically speaking it's against the law to drive under the influence of alcohol and you were arrested and you spent a month in prison or whatever but it's odd to say that's a criminal so just as an like example in this area is mark wahlberg marky mark that's what i always think of him as because that was his first sort of famous name who i wouldn't think should be listed as in the category american criminal even though he did he was convicted of quite a bad crime when he was a young person but we don't think of him as a criminal should the entry talk about that yeah that's actually an important part of his life story you know that he had a very rough youth and he could have you know gone down a really dark path and he turned his life around that's actually interesting so categories are tricky especially with people because we like to sign labels to people and to ideas somehow and those labels stick yeah and there's certain words that have a lot of power like criminal like political left right center anarchist objectivist what other philosophies are there marxist communist social democrat democratic socialist socialist and like if you add that as a category all of a sudden it's like oh boy you're that guy now yeah and i don't know if you wanna be that guy some definitely some really charged ones like alt right i think is quite quite a complicated and tough label i mean it's not a completely meaningless label but boy i think you really have to pause before you actually put that label on someone partly because now you're putting them in a group of people some of whom are quite you wouldn't wanna be grouped with so it's yeah let's go into some you mentioned the hot water of the pool that we're both tipping a a a toe in do you think wikipedia has a left leaning political bias which is something it is sometimes accused of yeah so i don't think so not broadly and you know i think you can always point to specific entries and talk about specific biases but that that's part of the process of wikipedia anyone can come and challenge and and to to go on about that but you know i i see fairly often on twitter you know some you know sort of quite extreme accusations of bias and i think you know actually i just i don't see it i don't buy that and if you ask people for an example they normally struggle and depending on who they are and and what it's about so it's certainly true that some people who have quite fringe viewpoints and who knows the full rush of history in five hundred years they might be considered to be path breaking geniuses but at the moment quite fringe views and they're just unhappy that wikipedia doesn't report on their fringe views as being mainstream and that by the way goes across all kinds of fields i mean i was once accosted on the street outside the ted conference in vancouver by a guy who's a homeopath who was very upset that wikipedia's entry on homeopathy basically says it's pseudoscience and he felt that was biased and i said i can't really help you because we cite good quality sources to talk about the scientific status and it's not very good so you know it depends and you know i think it's something that we should always be vigilant about but it's you know in general i think we're pretty good and i think any time you go to any serious political controversy we should have a pretty balanced perspective on who's saying what what the views are and so forth i would actually argue that the areas where we are more likely to have bias that persists for a long period of time are actually fairly obscure things or maybe fairly nonpolitical things i just give it's kind of a humorous example but it's it's meaningful if you read our entries about japanese anime mhmm they tend to be very very positive and very favorable because almost no one knows about japanese anime except for fans and so the people who come and spend their days writing japanese anime inherent love for the whole area now they'll of course being human beings have their internal debates and disputes about what's better or not you know but in general they're they're quite positive because nobody actually cares on anything that people are quite passionate about then hopefully you know there's like quite a lot of interesting stuff so i'll give an example a contemporary example where i think we've done a good job as of my most recent sort of look at it and that is the the question about the efficacy of masks during the covid pandemic and that's an area where i would say the public authorities really kind of jerked us all around a bit in the very first days they said whatever you do don't rush on and buy masks and their concern was shortages in hospitals okay fair enough later it's like no everybody's gotta wear a mask everywhere it's it really works really well and it's you know then now i think it's the evidence is mixed right masks seem to help in my personal view masks seem to help they're no huge burden you know you might as well wear a mask in any environment where you're with a giant crowd of people and so forth but it's very politicized that one mhmm and it's very politicized where certainly in the us you know much more so i i mean i live in in the uk i live in london i've never seen kind of on the streets sort of the kind of thing that i there's a lot of reports of people actively angry because someone else is wearing a mask that sort of thing in public and so because it became very politicized then clearly no so anyway if you go to wikipedia and you research this topic i think you'll find more or less what i've just said like actually after it's all you know to this point in history it's mixed evidence like mass seemed to help but maybe not as much as some of the authorities said and and here we are and that's kind of an example where i think okay we've done a good job but i suspect there are people on both sides of that very emotional debate who think this is ridiculous hopefully we've got quality sources so then hopefully those people who read this can say oh actually you know it is complicated so you know if you can get to the point of saying okay this is i have my view but i understand other views and i do think it's a complicated question great now we're a little bit more mature as a society well that one is an interesting one because i feel like i hope that that article also contains the meta conversation about the politicization of that topic yeah to me it's almost more interesting than whether masks work or not at least at this point it's like why it became masks became a symbol of the oppression of a centralized government if you wear them mhmm you're a sheep that follows the mass control the mass hysteria of an authoritarian regime and if you don't wear a mask then you're a science denier anti vaxxer a alt right probably a nazi so exactly and that that whole politicization of society is just so damaging and i don't i don't know in broader in the broader world like how do we start to fix that that's a really hard question well at every moment because you mentioned mainstream and fringe there seems to be a tension here and i wonder what your philosophy is on it because there's mainstream ideas and there's fringe ideas you look at lab leak theory for for this virus there could be other things we can discuss where there's a mainstream narrative well if you just look at the percent of the population or the population with platforms what they say and then what is a small percentage in opposition to that and what is wikipedia's responsibility to accurately represent both the mainstream and the fringe do you think well i mean i think we have to try to do our best to recognize both but also to appropriately contextualize and so this can be quite hard particularly when emotions are high that's just a fact about human beings i'll give a simpler example because there's not a lot of emotion around it like our entry on the moon doesn't say some say the moon's made of rocks some say cheese you know who knows that kind of false neutrality is not what we wanna get to like that doesn't make any sense but that one's easy like we all understand i think there is a wikipedia entry called something like the moon is made of cheese where it talks about this is a common sort of joke or or thing that children say or that people tell to children or whatever you know it's just a thing it's a everybody's heard moon's made of cheese but nobody thinks wow like wikipedia is so one-sided it doesn't even acknowledge the cheese theory i'd say the same thing about flat earth you know again it's exactly what i'm looking up right now very little controversy we will have an entry about flat earth theorizing flat earth people my personal view is most of the people who claim to be flat earthers are just having a laugh trolling and more power to them have some fun but let's not be you know ridiculous but then for most of human history people believe that the earth is flat so the article i'm looking at is actually kind of focusing on this history flat earth is an archaic and scientific disproven conception of the earth's shape as a plane or disk many ancient cultures subscribed to flat earth cosmography with pretty cool pictures of what a flat earth would look like with dragon is that dragon no angels on the on the edge there's a lot of controversy about that what is on the edge is it the wall is it angels yeah dragons is there a dome and how can you fly from south africa to perth because on a flat earth view that's really too far for any plane to make it what i wanna know it's all spread out what i wanna know is what's on the other side jimmy what's on the other side that's what all of us want to know yeah so there's some i'm i presume there's probably a small section about the conspiracy theory of flat earth because i think there's a sizable percent of the population who at least will say they believe in a flat earth yeah i i i think it is a a movement that just says that the mainstream narrative to have distrust and skepticism about the mainstream narrative which to a very small degree is probably a very productive thing to do as part of the scientific process but you can get a little silly and ridiculous with it yeah i mean yeah it it it's exactly right and so you know i i think i find on on many many cases and of course i like anybody else might quibble about this or that in any wikipedia article but in general i think there is a pretty good sort of willingness and indeed eagerness to say oh let's let's fairly represent all of the meaningfully important sides so there there's still a lot to unpack in that right so meaningfully important so you know people who are are raising questions about the efficacy of masks okay that's actually a reasonable thing to have a discussion about and hopefully we should treat that as a as a fair conversation to have and actually address which authorities have said what and so on and so forth and then you know there are other cases where it's not meaningful opposition you know like you just wouldn't say if i i mean i i doubt if the main article moon it may mention cheese but probably not even because it's not credible and it's not even meant to be serious by anyone or the article on the earth certainly won't have a paragraph that says well most scientists think it's round but certain people think flat like that's just a silly thing to put in that article you would wanna sort of address you know that's an interesting cultural phenomenon mhmm you wanna put it somewhere so this goes into all kinds of things about politics you wanna be really careful really thoughtful about not getting caught up in the anger of our times and really recognize denis i always thought i remember being really kind of proud of the us at the time when it was mccain was running against obama because i thought oh i've got plenty of disagreements with both of them but they both seemed like thoughtful and interesting people who i would have different disagreements with but i always felt like yeah like that that's good now we can have a debate now we can have an interesting debate and it isn't just sort of people slamming each other personal attacks and so forth and you're saying wikipedia also also represented that i hope so yeah and i i think so in in the main obviously you can always find debate that went horribly wrong because there's humans involved but speaking of those humans i would venture to guess i don't know the data maybe you can let me know but the personal political leaning of the group of people who edit wikipedia probably leans left i would guess so to me the question there is i mean the same is true for silicon valley the task for silicon valley is to create platforms that are not politically biased right even though there is a bias for the engineers who create it and i think i believe it's possible to do that you know there's kind of conspiracy theories that it somehow is impossible and there's this whole conspiracy where the left is controlling it and so on i think i think engineers for the most part want to create platforms that are open and unbiased that are that create all kinds of perspective because that's super exciting to have all kinds of perspectives battle it out but yeah still is there is there a degree to which the personal political bias of the editors might seep in in silly ways and in big ways silly ways could be i think hopefully i'm correct in saying this but the right will call it the democrat party and the left will call it the democratic party right yeah like subtle so like it always hits my ear weird like are are we children here we're like we're literally taking words and like just jabbing at each other like here i could i could like capitalize a thing in a certain way or i can like just just take a word and mess with them that's a small way of how you use words but you can also you know have a a a bigger way about about beliefs about various perspectives on political events on hunter biden's laptop on how big of a story that is or not how big the censorship of that story is or not that kind of and then there's these camps that take very strong points and they construct big narratives around that and they i mean it's very sizable percent of the population believes the two narratives that compete with each other yeah i mean it's it's really interesting and it feels but it's hard to judge you know the the sweep of history within your own lifetime yeah but it feels like it's gotten much worse that this idea of two parallel universes where people can agree on certain basic facts feels worse than it used to be and i'm not sure if that's true or if it just feels that way but also am not sure what the causes are i think i i would lay a lot of the blame in in recent years on social media algorithms which reward clickbait headlines which reward tweets that go viral and they go viral because they're cute and clever i mean my most successful tweet ever by a fairly wide margin some reporter tweeted at elon musk because he was complaining about wikipedia or something you should buy wikipedia and i just wrote not for sale nice and you know ninety zillion re tweets and people liked it and it was all very good but i'm like you know what it's cute line mhmm right and it's a good like mic drop and all that and i was pleased with myself i'm like it's not really discourse right it's not really sort of the what i like to do but it's what social media really rewards which is kind of a lets you and him have a fight right and that's more so i mean it's funny because at the time i was i was texting with elon who was very pleasant to me and all of that and it's like he might have been a little bit shitty the reporter might have been a little bit shitty but you fed into the shitty with snarky funny of a response not for sale yeah and like where do you like what so that's a funny little exchange and you could probably after that laugh it off and it's fun but like that kind of mechanism that rewards the snark yeah can go into viciousness yeah yeah well and and we certainly see it online you know i like a a series of tweets you know sort of a a a a tweet thread of fifteen tweets that assesses the quality of the evidence for masks pros and cons and and sort of wear this that's not gonna go viral you know but you know a smackdown for a famous politician who was famously in favor of mask who also went to a dinner and didn't wear a mask that's gonna go viral and you know that that's partly human nature you know people love to call out hypocrisy and and all that but it's partly what these systems elevate automatically i i talk about this with respect to facebook for example so i think facebook has done a pretty good job although it's taken longer than it should in some cases but you know if you have a a very large following and you're really spouting hatred or or misinformation disinformation they've kicked people off they've done you know some reasonable things there but actually the deeper issue is of this this the anger we're talking about of the the contentiousness of everything i make a a family example with two great stereotypes so one the the the crackpot racist uncle mhmm and one the sweet grandma and i always wanna point out about all of my uncles in my family were wonderful people so i didn't have a crackpot racist but everybody knows the stereotype well so grandma she just posts like sweet comments on the kids' pictures and congratulates people on their wedding anniversary and crackpot uncle's posting his nonsense and normally sort of at christmas dinner everybody rolls their eyes oh yeah uncle frank's here he's probably gonna say some racist comment and we're gonna tell him to shut up or you know maybe let's not invite him this year you know the normal human drama he's got his three mates down at the pub who listen to him and and all of that but now grandma's got you know fifty four followers on facebook which is the intimate family and racist uncle has seven hundred and fourteen he's not a massive influence or whatever but how did that happen it's because the algorithm notices oh when when she posts nothing happens he posts and then everybody jumps in to go shut up uncle frank you know like that's outrageous and it's like oh there's engagement there's page views there's ads right and and those algorithms i think they're working to improve that but it's really hard for them it's hard to improve that if that actually is working if the people who are saying things that get engagement if it's not too awful but it's just you know like maybe it's not a racist uncle but maybe it's an uncle who posts a lot about what an idiot biden is right which isn't necessarily an offensive or blockable or banable thing and it shouldn't be but if that's the discourse that gets elevated because it gets a rise out of people then suddenly in a society it's like oh we get more of what we reward so i i i think that's a piece of what's going on well if we could just take that tangent i'm having a conversation with mark zuckerberg second time is there something you can comment on how to decrease toxicity on that particular platform facebook you also have worked on creating a social network that is less toxic yourself yeah so can we just talk about the different ideas that these already big social networks can do and what you have been trying to do so a piece of it is it's hard so i don't the the problem with making a recommendation to facebook is that i actually believe their business model makes it really hard for them and i'm not anti capitalism i'm not you know great somebody's got business they're making money that's not that's not where i come from but certain business models mean you are gonna prioritize things that maybe aren't that long term helpful and so that's a big piece of it so certainly for facebook you could say you know with vast resources start to prioritize content that's higher quality that's healing that's kind try not to prioritize content that seems to be just getting a rise out of people now those are vague human descriptions right but i do believe good machine learning algorithms you can optimize in slightly different ways but to do that you may have to say actually we're not necessarily gonna increase page views to the maximum extent right now and i've said this to people at at facebook it's like you know if if your actions are you know convincing people that you're breaking western civilization that's really bad for business in the long run mhmm certainly these days i'll say twitter is the thing that's on people's minds as being more upsetting at the moment but i think it's true and so one of the things that's really interesting about facebook compared to a lot of companies is that mark has a pretty unprecedented amount of power his ability to name members of the board his control of the company is is pretty hard to break even if financial results aren't as good as they could be because he's taken a step back from the perfect optimization to say actually for the long term health in the next fifty years of this organization we need to rein in some of the things that are working for us and making money because they're actually giving us a bad reputation so one of the recommendations i would say is and this is not to do with the algorithms and all that but you know how about just a moratorium on all political advertising i don't think it's their most profitable segment but it's given rise to a lot of deep hard questions about dark money about you know ads that are run by questionable people that push false narratives or you know the classic kind of thing is you run i saw i saw a study about brexit mhmm in in the uk where people were talking about there were ads run to animal rights activists saying finally when we're out from under europe the uk can pass proper animal rights legislation we're not constrained by the european process similarly for people who are advocates of fox hunting to say finally when we're out of europe we can we can reimplement so you're telling people what they wanna hear and in some cases it's really hard for journalists to see that so it used to be that for political advertising you really needed to find some kind of mainstream and this is still true to an extent mainstream narrative that sixty percent of people can say oh i can buy into that which meant it pushed you to the center it pushed you to sort of try and find some nuance balance but if your main method of recruiting people is a tiny little one on one conversation with them because you're able to target using targeted advertising suddenly you don't need consistent you just need a really good targeting operation really good cambridge analytic style machine learning algorithm data to convince people and that just feels really problematic so i mean until they can think about how to solve that problem i would just say you know what it's gonna cost us x amount but it's gonna be worth it to kinda say you know what we actually think our political advertising policy hasn't really helped contribute to that discourse and dialogue and finding reasoned you know middle ground and compromised solutions so let's just not do that for a while until we figure that out so that's maybe a piece of advice i'd and and coupled with as you were saying recommender systems for the news feed and and other contexts that don't always optimize engagement but optimize the long term mental well-being and balance and growth of a human being yeah it's a very difficult problem it's it's a difficult problem yeah and you know so in in with wt social wikitreene social we're launching in a few months' time a completely new system new domain name new new lots of things but the idea is to say let's let's focus on trust people can rate each other as trustworthy rate content as trustworthy you have to start from somewhere so we'll start with a a core base of our tiny community who i think are sensible thoughtful people wanna recruit more but to say you know what actually let's have that as a pretty strong element to say let's not optimize based on what gets the most page views in this session let's optimize on what sort of the feedback from people is this is meaningfully enhancing my life mhmm and so part of that is and it's probably not a good business model but part of that is okay we're not gonna pursue an advertising model but a you know membership model where you know you can you don't have to be a member but you can pay to be a member you maybe get some benefit from that but in general to say actually the problem with and and actually the the division i would say is and and the the analogy i would give is broadcast television funded by advertising gives you a different result than paying for hbo paying for netflix paying for whatever and the reason is you know if you think about it if what what is your incentive as a a tv producer you're gonna make a comedy for abc network in the us you basically say i want something that almost everybody will like and listen to so it tends to be a little blander you know family friendly whatever whereas if you say oh actually i'm i'm gonna use the hbo example and an old example you say you know what sopranos isn't for everybody mhmm sex and the city isn't for everybody but between the two shows we've got something for everybody that they're willing to pay for mhmm so you can get edgier higher quality in my view content rather than saying it's gotta not offend anybody in the world it's gotta be for everybody which is really hard so same thing you know here in a social network if your business model is advertising it's gonna drive you in one direction if your business model is membership i think it drives you in a different direction i actually and i've said this to elon about twitter blue which i think wasn't rolled out well and so forth but it's like the piece of that that i like is to say look actually if there's a model where your revenue is coming from people who are willing to pay for the service even if it's only part of your revenue if it's a substantial part that does change your broader incentives to say actually are people gonna be willing to pay for something that's actually just toxicity in their lives now i'm not sure it's been rolled out well i'm not sure how it's going and maybe i'm wrong about that as a as a plausible business model but i do think it's interesting to think about just in in in broad terms business model drives outcomes in sometimes surprising ways unless you really pause to think about it so if we can just link on twitter and elon before i would love to talk to you about the underlying business model wikipedia which is this brilliant bold move at the very beginning but let's since you mentioned twitter what do you think works what do you think is broken about twitter oof i mean it's a long conversation but to to start with one of the things that i always say is it's a really hard problem so i concede that right up front i said this about you know the old ownership of twitter and the new ownership of twitter because unlike wikipedia and this is true actually for for all social media there's a box and the box basically says what do you think what's on your mind you can write whatever the hell you want right this is true by the way even for for youtube i mean the box is to upload a video but again it's just like an open ended invitation to express yourself and what makes that hard is some people have really toxic really bad you know some people are very aggressive they're actually stalking they're actually you know abusive and suddenly you deal with a lot of problems whereas at wikipedia there is no box that says what's on your mind there's a box that says this is an entry about the moon please be neutral please cite your facts then there's a talk page which is not coming rant about donald trump mhmm if you go on the talk page of the donald trump entry and you just start ranting about donald trump people would say what are you doing like stop doing that like we're not here to discuss like there's a whole world of the internet out there for you to go and rant about donald trump it's just not fun to do on wikipedia somehow it's fun on twitter well also on wikipedia people are gonna say stop yeah and actually are you here to tell us like how can we improve the article or are you just here to rant about trump because that's not actually interesting so because the the goal is different so that's just admitting and and then saying upfront this is a hard problem certainly i'm i'm writing a book on trust so the idea is you know in the last twenty years we've lost trust you know in all kinds of institutions and politics you know the the edelman trust barometer survey has been done for a long time and you know trust in politicians trust in journalism it's it's come declined substantially and i think in many cases deservedly so how do we restore trust and how do we think about that and does that also include trust in the idea of truth trust in the idea of truth even the concept of facts and truth is really really important and the and the idea of uncomfortable truths is is really important now so when we when we look at twitter right and we say we can see okay this is really hard so here here's my my story about twitter it's two part story and it's all pre elon musk ownership so many years back somebody accused me of horrible crimes on on twitter and i you know like anybody would i thought you know i'm in the public eye people say bad things i don't really you know i brush it off whatever but i'm like this is actually really bad like accusing me of pedophilia like that's just not okay so i thought i'm gonna report this so i click report and i report the tweet and there's five others and i go through the process and then i get an email which says you know whatever a couple hours later saying thank you for your report we're looking into this great okay good then several hours further i get an email back saying sorry we don't see anything here to violate our terms of use and i'm like okay so i emailed jack and i say jack come on like this is ridiculous and he emails back roughly saying yeah sorry jimmy don't worry we'll we'll sort this out and i just thought to myself you know what that's not the point right i'm jimmy wales i know jack dorsey i can email jack dorsey he'll listen to me because he's got an email from me and sorts it out for me what about the teenager who's being bullied and is getting abuse right and getting accusations that aren't true are they getting the same kind of like really poor result in that case so fast forward a few years same thing happens the the exact quote i think it was please help me i'm only ten years old and jimmy wales raped me last week it's like come on fuck off like that's ridiculous so i report i'm i'm like this time i'm reporting but i'm thinking well we'll see what happens this one gets even worse because then i get same result email back saying sorry we don't see any problems so i raise it with other members of the board who i know and jack and like this is really ridiculous like this is outrageous and some of the board members friends of mine sympathetic and so good for them but i actually got an email back then from the general counsel head of trust and safety saying actually there's nothing in this tweet that violates our terms of service we don't regard and and gave reference to the me too movement if we didn't allow accusations the me too movement it's an important thing and i was like you know what actually if someone says i'm ten years old and someone raped me last week i think the advice should be here's the phone number of the police like you need to get the police involved twitter is not the place for that accusation so even back then by the way they did delete those tweets but i mean the rationale they gave is spammy behavior right so completely separate from abusing me it was just like oh well they were retweeting too often okay whatever so like that's just broken like that's a system that it's not working for people in the public eye i'm sure it's not working for private people who get abuse really horrible abuse can happen so how is that today well it hasn't happened to me since elon took over but i don't see why it couldn't and i suspect now if i send a report and email someone there's no one there to email me back because he's gotten rid of a lot of the trust and safety staff so i suspect that problem is still really hard just content moderation at huge scales at huge scales is really something and i don't know the full answer to this i mean a piece of it could be you know to say actually making specific allegations of crimes this isn't the place to do that you know we've got a huge database if you've got an accusation of crime here's who you should call the police the fbi whatever it is it's not to be done in public and then you do face really complicated questions about me too movement and people coming forward in public and and all of that but it's again it's like probably you should talk to a journalist right probably there are better avenues than just tweeting from an account that was created ten days ago obviously set up to abuse someone so i think they could do a lot better but i also admit it's a hard problem and there's also ways to indirectly or more humorously or a more mocking way to make the same kinds of accusations in in fact the accusations you mentioned if i were to guess don't go that viral because they're not funny enough or cutting enough but if you make it witty and cutting and and meme it somehow yeah yeah yeah sometimes actually indirectly for sure making the accusation versus directly making the accusation that can go viral and that can destroy reputations and yeah and you you get to watch yourself just all kinds of narratives takes take hold yeah no i mean i remember another case that didn't bother me because it wasn't of that nature but somebody was saying you know i'm sure you you're you're making millions off of wikipedia i'm like no actually i don't even work there i have no salary and they're like you're lying i'm gonna check your nine ninety form which is the us form for tax reporting for charities yeah i'm not here here's the link go go read it and you'll see i'm listed as a board member and my salary is listed as zero so you know so you know things like that it's like okay that one that feels like you're wrong but i can take that and i can we can have that debate quite quickly and again it didn't go viral because it was kind of silly and if if anything would have gone viral it was me responding mhmm but that's one where it's like actually i'm happy to respond because a lot of people don't know that i don't work there and that i don't make millions and i'm not a billionaire well they they must know that because it's in most news media about me but the other one i didn't respond to publicly because it's like barbra streisand effect you know it's like sometimes calling attention to someone who's abusing you who basically has no followers and so on is just a a waste and everything you're describing now is just something that all of us have to kinda learn because everybody's in the public eye i think when you have just two followers and you get bullied by one of the followers it hurts just as much as when you have a large number so it's not your situation i think is echoed in the situations of millions of other yeah especially teenagers and kids and so on yeah i mean it's actually an an example so we don't generally use my picture and the banners anymore on wikipedia but we did and then we did an experiment one year where we tried other people's pictures so one of our developers and you know one guy lovely very sweet guy and he doesn't look like your immediate thought of a nerdy silicon valley developer he looks like a heavy metal dude mhmm because he's cool mhmm and so suddenly here he is with long hair and tattoos and and there's there's his sort of say here's what your money goes for here's my my letter asking for support and he got massive abuse from wikipedia like calling him creepy and you know like really massive and this was being shown to eighty million people a day his picture not the abuse right the abuse was elsewhere on the internet and he he he was bothered by it and i thought you know what there is a difference i actually am in the public eye yeah i get huge benefits from being in the public eye i go around and make public speeches any random thing i think of i can write and get it published in the new york times and you know have this interesting life he's not a public figure and so actually he wasn't mad at us he was just like yeah actually suddenly being thrust in the public eye and you get suddenly lots of abuse which normally you know if you're a teenager and somebody in your class is abusing you it's not gonna go viral so you're only gonna it's gonna be hurtful because it's local and it's your classmates or whatever but when when sort of ordinary people go viral in some abusive way it's really really quite tragic i don't know i mean even at a small scale it feels viral when when five people right yeah five people at your school and there's a rumor and there's this feeling like you're surrounded and nobody and the the feeling of loneliness i think which you're speaking to when you don't have a plat when you at least feel like you don't have a platform to defend yourself yeah and then this powerlessness that i think a lot of teenagers definitely feel and a lot of people i think you're right yeah and that i i think even when just like two people make up stuff about you or lie about you or say mean things about you or bully you that can feel like a crowd like yeah yeah no that that's a and it's a tear i mean whatever that is in our genetics in our biology in our the way our brain works it just can be a terrifying experience and somehow to correct that i mean i think because everybody feels the pain of that everybody suffers the pain of that i think we'll be forced to fix that as a society to figure out a way around that i think it's really hard to fix because i don't think that problem isn't necessarily new you know someone in high school who writes graffiti that says becky is a slut mhmm and spreads a rumor about what becky did last weekend that's always been damaging it's always been hurtful and that's that's really hard those kinds of attacks are as old as time itself they precede the internet now what do you think about this technology that feels wikipedia like which is community notes on twitter do you like it yeah yeah pros and cons do you think it's scalable i do like it i don't know enough about specifically how it's implemented to really have a very deep view but i do think it's quite it's the uses i've seen of it i've i've found quite good and in some cases changed my mind you know it's like i see something and of course you know the the sort of human tendency is to retweet something that you hope is true or that you are afraid is true or you know it's like that kind of quick mental action and then you know i saw something that i liked and agreed with and then a community note under it that made me think oh actually this is a more nuanced issue mhmm so i like that i think that's really important now how is it specifically implemented is it scalable i don't really know how they've done it so i can't really comment on that but in general i do think it's you know when you're when you're only mechanisms on twitter and you're a big twitter user you know we know the platform and and you've got plenty of followers and all of that the only mechanisms are retweeting replying blocking it's a pretty limited scope and it's kind of good if there's a way to elevate a specific thoughtful response mhmm and it kind of goes to again like does the algorithm just pick the retweet or the i mean retweeting it's not even the algorithm that makes it viral like you know if paulo coelho very famous author i think he's got like i don't know i haven't looked lately he used to have eight million twitter followers i think i looked and he's got sixteen million now or whatever well if he retweets something it's gonna get seen a lot or elon musk if he retweets something it's gonna get seen a lot that's not an algorithm that's just the way the platform works it is kind of nice if you have something else and how that something else is designed that's obviously complicated question well there's this interesting thing that i think twitter is doing but i know facebook is doing for sure which is really interesting so you have what are the signals that a human can provide at scale like in twitter it's retweet yep in facebook i think you can share i think yeah but there's basic interactions you can have comment and so on yeah but there's also in facebook and youtube has this too is would you like to see more of this or would you like to see less of this mhmm mhmm they post that sometimes and the thing that the the neural net that's learning from that has to figure out is the intent behind you saying i wanna see less of this mhmm did you see too much of this content already you like it but you don't wanna see so much of it mhmm you already figured it out good great or does this content not make you feel good there's so many interpretations that i would like to see less of this but if if you get that kind of signal this actually can create a really powerfully curated list of content that is fed to you every day that doesn't that doesn't create an echo chamber or a silo it actually just makes you feel good yeah in the in the good way which is like it challenges you but it doesn't exhaust you yeah and make you kind of this this this this weird animal i've been saying for a long time if i went on facebook one morning and they said oh we're we're testing a new option rather than showing you things we think you're going to like we wanna show you some things that we think you will disagree with but which we have some signals that suggest it's of quality like now that sounds interesting yeah that sounds really interesting i wanna see something where you know like oh i don't i don't agree with so larry lessig is a good friend of mine founder of creative commons and he's moved on to doing stuff about corruption and politics and so on and i don't always agree with larry but i always grapple with larry because he's so interesting and he's so thoughtful that even when we don't agree i'm like actually i i wanna hear him out mhmm right because i'm gonna learn from it and that doesn't mean i always come around to agreeing with him but i'm gonna understand the perspective and that's really great feeling yeah there's this interesting thing on social media where people kind of accuse others of saying well you don't wanna hear opinions that you disagree with or ideas you disagree with i think this is something that's thrown at me all the time the reality is there's literally almost nothing i enjoy more seems an odd thing to accuse you of because you have quite a wide range of long conversations with a very diverse bunch of people but there is a very there is like a a a very harsh drop off because what i like is high quality disagreement that really makes me think yeah and at a certain point there's a threshold it's a kind of a gray area when the quality of the disagreement it just sounds like mocking and you're not really interested in a a deep understanding of the topic or you yourself don't seem to carry deep understanding of the topic like there's something called intelligence squared debates yeah the main one is the british version with the british accent every everything always sounds better and the brits seem to argue more intensely like they're invigorated they're energized by the debate those people i often disagree with basically everybody involved and it's so fun i learned something that's high quality if we could do that if there's some way for me to click a button that says filter out lower quality just today just sometimes show it to me because i wanna be able to but today i'm just not in the mood it's awesome for the mockery yeah just high quality stuff even because mhmm even flatter i wanna i wanna get high quality arguments for the flat earth it would make me feel good mhmm because i i would see oh that's really interesting like i i never really thought in my mind to challenge the mainstream narrative of of general relativity right of a of a perception of physics maybe all of reality maybe all of all of space time is an illusion that's really interesting i never really thought about let me consider that fully okay what's the evidence how do you test that what is what are the alternatives how would you be able to have such consistent perception of a physical reality if it's all of it is an illusion all of us seem to share the same kind of perception of reality like what like that that's the kind of stuff i love but not like the mockery of it you know that that that cheap that it seems that social media can kind of inspire yeah i i i talk sometimes about how people assume that like the big debates in wikipedia or the the sort of arguments are between the party of the left and the party of the right and i would say no it's actually the party of the kind and thoughtful and the party of the jerks is really is really it i mean left and right like yeah bring me somebody i disagree with politically as long as they're thoughtful kind we're gonna have a you know a real discussion i i i give an example of our article on abortion so you know if you can bring together a kind and thoughtful catholic priest and a kind and thoughtful planned parenthood activist and they're gonna work together on the article on abortion that can be a really great thing if they're both kind and thoughtful like that's the important part they're never gonna agree on the topic but they will understand okay like wikipedia is not gonna take a side but wikipedia is gonna explain what the debate is about and we're gonna try to characterize it fairly and it turns out like your kind and thoughtful people even if they're quite ideological like a catholic priest is generally gonna be quite ideological on the subject of abortion but they can grapple with ideas and they can discuss and they they may feel very proud of the entry at the end of the day not because they suppress the other side's views but because they think the case has been stated very well that other people can come to understand it and if you're highly ideological you assume i think naturally if people understood as much about this as i do they'll probably agree with me you may be wrong about that but that's often the case so so that's where you know that's what i think we need to encourage more of in society generally is is grappling with ideas in a really in a thoughtful way so is it possible if the majority of volunteers editors of wikipedia really dislike donald trump are they still able to write an article that empathizes with the perspective of for a time at least a very large percentage of the united states that were supporters of donald trump and to have a full broad representation of him as a human being him as a political leader him as a set of policies promised and implemented all that kind of stuff yeah i think so and i think if you read the article it's pretty good and i think a piece of that is within our community if people have the the self awareness to understand so i personally wouldn't go and edit the entry on donald trump i get emotional about it and i'm like i'm not good at this and if i tried to do it i would fail i wouldn't be a good wikipedian so it's better if i just step back and let people who are more dispassionate on this topic edit it whereas there are other topics that are incredibly emotional to some people where i can actually do quite well like i'm gonna be okay maybe we were discussing earlier the efficacy of masks i'm like oh i think that's an interesting problem and i don't know the answer but i can help kind of catalog what's the best evidence and so on i'm not gonna get upset i'm not gonna get angry i'm i'm able to be a good wikipedian so i think that's important and i do think though in in a related framework that the composition of the community is really important not because wikipedia is or should be a battleground but because blind spots like maybe i don't even realize what's biased if i'm if i'm particularly of a certain point of view and i've never thought much about it so one of the things we we focus on a lot the wikipedia volunteers are we don't know the exact number but let's say eighty percent plus male and they're of a certain demographic they tend to be college educated heavier on tech geeks than not you know etcetera etcetera so it it there is a demographic to the community and that's pretty much global i mean somebody said to me once why is it only white men who edit wikipedia and i said we've obviously not met the japanese wikipedia community it's kind of a joke because the broader principle still stands who edits japanese wikipedia a bunch of geeky men right and women as well so we do have women in the community and that's very important but we do think okay you know what that does lead to some problems it leads to some content issues simply because people write more about what they know and what they're interested in they'll tend to be dismissive of things as being unimportant if it's not something that they personally have an interest in i you know i like the example as a parent i would say our entries on early childhood development probably aren't as good as they should be because a lot of the wikipedia volunteers actually we're getting older the wikipedians so the the demographic has changed a bit but that's fine you know it's like if you've if you've got a bunch of twenty five year old tech geek dudes who don't have kids they're just not gonna be interested in early childhood development and if they tried to write about it they probably wouldn't do a good job because they don't know anything about it and somebody did a a look at our entries on on novelists who've won a major literary prize and they looked at the male novelist versus the female and the male novelist had longer and higher quality entries and why is that well it's not because because i know hundreds of wikipedians it's not because these are a bunch of biased sexist men who are like books by women are not important it's like no actually there is a gender kind of breakdown of readership there are books like hard science fiction is a classic example hard science fiction mostly read by men other types of novels more read by women and if we don't have women in the community then these award winning clearly important novelists may have less coverage and not because anybody consciously thinks oh we don't like what a book by maya angelou like who cares she's a poet like that's not interesting no but just because people write what they know they write what they're interested in so we do think diversity in the community is really important and that's one area where i do think it's really clear but i can also say you know what actually that also applies in the political sphere like to say actually we do want kind and thoughtful catholic priests kind and thoughtful conservatives kind and thoughtful libertarians kind and thoughtful marxists you know to come in but the key is the kind and thoughtful piece so when people sometimes come to wikipedia outraged by some you know dramatic thing that's happened on twitter they come to wikipedia with a chip on their shoulder ready to do battle yeah and it just doesn't work out very well you know and there's tribes in general where i think there's a responsibility on the larger group to be even kinder and more welcoming to the smaller group yeah we think that's really important and so you know oftentimes people come in and you know there's a lot when i talk about community health one of the aspects of that that we do think about a lot that i think about a lot is not about politics it's just like how are we treating newcomers to the community mhmm and so i can tell you what our ideals are what our philosophy is but do we live up to that so you know the ideal is you come to wikipedia you know we have rules like one of our fundamental rules is ignore all rules mhmm which is partly written that way because it kinda piques people's attention like oh what what what the hell kind of rule is that you know but basically says look don't get nervous and depressed about a bunch of you know what's the formatting of your footnote right so you shouldn't come to wikipedia add a link and then get banned or yelled at because it's not the right format instead somebody should go oh hey yeah thanks for for helping but you know here's the link to how to format you know if you wanna keep going you might wanna learn how to format a footnote and and to be friendly and to be open and to say oh right oh you're new and you clearly don't know everything about wikipedia and you know sometimes in any community that can be quite hard so people come in and they've got a great big idea and they're gonna propose this to the wikipedia community and they have no idea that's basically a perennial discussion we've had seven thousand times before and so then ideally you would say to the person oh yeah great thanks like a lot of people have and here's where we got to and here's the nuanced conversation we've had about that in the past that i think you'll find interesting and sometimes people are just like oh god another one you know who's come in with this idea which doesn't work and they don't understand why you can lose patience but you shouldn't and that's kind of human you know but i think it just does require really thinking you know in a in a self aware manner of like oh i was once a newbie actually we do have we have a great i just did an interview with emily temple woods who i she was wikipedia of the year she's just like a great well known wikipedian and i interviewed her for my book and she told me something i never knew apparently it's not secret she didn't reveal it to me but is that when she started at wikipedia she was a vandal she came in and vandalized wikipedia and then basically what happened was she'd done some sort of vandalized a couple of articles and then somebody popped up on her talk page and said hey like why are you doing this like we're we're trying to make an encyclopedia here and this wasn't very kind yeah and she felt so bad she's like oh right i didn't really think of it that way she just was coming in as she was like thirteen years old combative and you know like having fun and trolling a bit and then she's like oh actually oh i see your point and became a great wikipedian so that's the ideal really is that you don't just go throw block fuck off yeah you go hey you know like what what gives you know which is i think the way we tend to treat things in real life you know if you've got somebody who's doing something obnoxious in your friend group you probably go hey like really i i i don't know if you've noticed but i think this person is actually quite hurt that you keep making that joke about them and then they usually go oh you know what i didn't i thought that was okay i didn't and then they stop or they keep it up and then everybody goes well you're the asshole well i yeah i mean that's just an example that gives me faith in humanity that that that we're all capable and wanting to be kind to each other and in general this the fact that there's a small group of volunteers that are able to contribute so much to the organization the collection the the discussion of all of human knowledge is so it makes me so grateful to be part of this whole human project i that's one of the reasons i love wikipedia it gives me faith in humanity no i i i once was at wikimani is our annual conference and people come from all around the world like really active volunteers i was at the dinner we were in egypt a wikimania in alexandria at the sort of closing dinner or whatever so we have dinner and it just turned out i sat down at the table with most of the members of the english language arbitration committee and there are a bunch of very sweet geeky wikipedians and as we left the table i said to her it's really like i i still find this kind of sense of amazement like we just had dinner with some of the most powerful people in english language media because they're the people who are like the final court of appeal in english wikipedia and thank goodness they're not media moguls right they're just a bunch of geeks who are just like well liked in the community because they're kind and they're thoughtful and they really you know sort of think about things i was like this is great love wikipedia it's it's like to the degree that geeks run the best aspect of human civilization brings me joy in all aspects and this is true in programming like linux yeah like programmers all in all like people that kinda specialize in a thing and they don't really get caught up in into the mess of the bickering of of society they just kinda do their thing yeah and they value the craftsmanship of it yeah the confidence of it but if you if you've if you've never heard of this or looked into it you'll enjoy it i read something recently that i didn't even know about but like the the the fundamental like time zones and and they change from time to time you know sometimes a country will pass daylight savings or move it by a week whatever there's a file that's on all you know sort of unix based computers and basically all computers end up using this file it's the official time zone file but why is it official it's just this one guy yeah it's like this guy and a group a community around him and basically something something weird happened and it broke something because he was on vacation and i'm just like isn't that wild right that you would think i mean first of all most people never even think about like how do computers know about time zones well they know because they just use this file which tells all the time zones and which dates they change and all of that but there's this one guy and he doesn't get paid for it it's just he's like you know with all the billions of people on the planet he sort of put his hand up and goes yo i'll take care of the time zone you know and there's a lot a lot a lot of programmers listening to this right now with ptsd about time zones yeah and then there i mean there's on top of this one guy there's other libraries the different programming languages that help manage the time zones for you but still there's just within those there's it's it's amazing just the packages the libraries how few people build them oh yeah out of their own love for building for creating for community and all of that yeah it's i almost like don't want to interfere with the natural habitat of the geek right like when you spot them in the wild you just wanna be like woah careful yeah that thing that thing no i treasured i i met a guy many years ago lovely really sweet guy and he's running a bot on english wikipedia that i thought wow that's actually super clever what he had done is his bot was like spell checking but rather than simple spell checking what he had done is create a database of words that are commonly mistaken for other words they're spelled wrong so i can even give an example and so the word is people often spell it wrong but no spell checker catches it because it is another word and so what he did is he wrote a bot that looks for these words and then checks the sentence around it for certain keywords so in in some context this isn't correct but buoy and boy mhmm people sometimes type b o y when they mean b o u y mhmm so if he sees the word boy b o y in an article he would look in the context and see is this a nautical reference and if it was he didn't autocorrect he just would flag it up to himself to go oh check this one out and that's not a great example but he had thousands of examples i was like that's amazing like i would have never thought to do that and i'm glad that we did and that's also part of the openness of the system and also i think being a charity being you know this idea of like actually this is a gift to the world that makes someone go oh oh well i'll put my hand up i i see a little piece of things i can make better because i'm a good programmer and i can write this script to do this thing and i'll find it fun amazing well i gotta ask about this big bold decision at the very beginning to not do advertisements on the website and just in general the philosophy of the business model wikipedia what what went behind that yeah so i think most people know this but we're a charity so in the us you know registered as a charity and we don't have any ads on the site and the vast majority of the money is from donations but the vast majority from small donors so people giving twenty five bucks or whatever if you're listening to this go donate go donate donate now five bucks i've donated so many times and we have you know millions of donors every year but it's like a small percentage of people i would say in the early days a big part of it was aesthetic almost as much as anything else it was just like i just think i don't really want ads on wikipedia like i just think it would be there's a lot of reasons why it might not be good and even back then i didn't think as much as i have since about a business model can tend to drive you in a certain place and really thinking that through in advance is really important because you might say yeah we're really really keen on community control and neutrality but if we had an advertising based business model probably that would begin to erode even if i believe in it very strongly organizations tend to follow the money in the dna in the long run and so things like i mean it's easy to think about some of the immediate problems so like if you go to read about i don't know nissan car company and if you saw an ad for the new nissan at the top of the page you might be like did they pay for this or you know like the like do the advertisers have influence over the content because you kinda wonder about that for all kinds of media and that undermines trust undermines trust right but also things like you know we don't have clickbait headlines on wikipedia you've never seen you know wikipedia entries with all this kind of listicles you know sort of the ten ten funniest cat pictures number seven will make you cry you know none of that kind of stuff because there's no incentive no reason to do that also you know there's no reason to have an algorithm to say actually we're gonna use our algorithm to drive you to stay on the website longer we're gonna use the algorithm to drive you to you know it's like you're reading about queen victoria there's nothing to sell you when you're reading about queen victoria let's move you on to las vegas because actually the ad revenue around hotels in las vegas is quite good so we don't have that sort of there's no incentive for the organization to go oh let's let's move people around to things that have better ad revenue instead it's just like oh well what's most interesting to the community just to to make those links so that decision just seemed obvious to me but as i say it was less of a business decision and more of an aesthetic it's like oh like this is how i i like wikipedia it doesn't have ads don't really want you know in these early days like a lot of the ads that that was well before the era of really quality ad targeting and all that so you got a lot of banners punch the monkey ads and all that kind of nonsense and so you know but there was no guarantee there was no it was not really clear how could we fund this you know like it was pretty cheap but it still is quite cheap compared to you know most you know we don't have a hundred thousand employees and all of that but would we be able to raise money through donations and so i remember the the first time that we did like really did a a donation campaign was on a christmas day in two thousand three i think it was there was we had three servers database servers and two front end servers and they were all the same size or whatever and two of them crashed they broke like i don't even know remember now like the hard drive it was like it was christmas day so i scrambled on christmas day to sort of go onto the database server which fortunately survived and have it become a front end server as well and then the site was really slow and it wasn't working very well and i was like okay it's time we need to do a fundraiser and so i was hoping to raise dollars twenty thousand in a month's time but we raised nearly thirty thousand within two three weeks' time so that was the first proof point of like oh like we put a banner up and people will donate like we just explain we need the money and people are like already we were very small back then and people were like oh yeah like i love this i wanna contribute then over the years we've become more sophisticated about the fundraising campaigns and we've tested a lot of different messaging and so forth what we used to think you know i remember one year we really went went heavy with we have great ambitions to you know the the idea of wikipedia is a free encyclopedia for every single person on the planet so what about the languages of sub saharan africa so i thought okay we're trying to raise money we need to talk about that because it's really important and near and dear to my heart and just instinctively knowing nothing about charity fundraising you see it all around it's like oh charities always mention like the poor people they're helping so let's talk about that didn't really work as well the the pitch that like this is very vague and very sort of broad but the pitch that works better than any other in general is a fairness pitch of like you use it all the time you should probably chip in and most people are like yeah you know what my life would suck without wikipedia i use it constantly and whatever i should chip in like it just seems like the right thing to do and that and there's many variants on that obviously and that's really it works and like people are like oh yeah like wikipedia i love wikipedia and and you know i shouldn't and so sometimes people say you know why are you always begging for money on the website and you know i've it's it's not that often it's not that much but it does happen they're like why don't you just get google and facebook and microsoft why don't they pay for it and i'm like i don't think that's really the right answer influence starts to creep in influence starts to creep in and questions start to creep in like the best funding for wikipedia is the small donors we also have major donors right we have high net worth people who donate but we always are very careful about that sort of thing to say wow that's really great and really important but we can't let that become influence because that would just be really quite quite yeah not good for wikipedia i would love to know how many times i visited wikipedia how much time i spent on it mhmm because i have a general sense that it's the most useful site i've ever used competing maybe with google search yeah which ultimately lands on competing yeah yeah yeah you're right but i if i were just reminded of like hey remember all those times your life was me better because of the site yeah i think i would be much more like yeah why did i waste money on-site x y z when i could be like i should be giving a lot of yeah here well you know the guardian newspaper has a similar model which is they have ads but they also there's no paywall but they just encourage people to donate and they do that like i've sometimes seen a banner saying oh this is your hundred and thirty fourth article you've read this year would you like to donate and i think that's i think it's effective i mean they're testing but also i wonder just for some people if they just don't feel like guilty and then think well i shouldn't bother them so much i don't know it's a good question i don't know the answer i guess that's the thing i could also turn on because that'll make me have i feel like legitimately there's some sites that speaks to our social media discussion wikipedia unquestionably makes me feel better about myself mhmm if i spend time on it like there's some websites where i'm like if i spend time on twitter sometimes i'm like i regret there's i think elon talks about this minimize the number of regretted minutes yeah my number of regretted minutes on wikipedia is like zero like i i don't remember a time i've just discovered this i started following on instagram a page depth of wikipedia oh yeah there's like crazy wikipedia page yeah there's no wikipedia page that yeah i gave her a a media contributor of the year award this year because she's so great yeah she's amazing of wikipedia is so fun so i yeah so that's that's that's a kinda interesting point that i i don't even know if there's a competitor there maybe this sort of programming stack overflow type of websites but everything else there's always a trade off there's a it's probably because of the ad driven model because there's an incentive to pull you into clickbait yeah and wikipedia has no clickbait yeah it's all about the quality of the knowledge and the wisdom and so on no that's right and i i also like stack over although i wonder i wonder what you think of this i've i so i only program for fun as a hobby and i don't have enough time to do it but i do and i'm not very good at it so therefore i end up on stack overflow quite a lot trying to figure out what's gone wrong and i have really transitioned to using chatgpt yeah much more for that because i can often find the answer clearly explained and it just it works better than sifting through threads and i kinda feel bad about that because i do love stack overflow and their community i mean i'm assuming i haven't read anything about in the news about it i'm assuming they are keenly aware of this and they're thinking about how can we sort of use this chunk of knowledge that we've got here and provide a new type of interface where you can query it with a question and actually get an answer that's based on the answers that we've had i don't know mhmm i and i think stack overflow currently has policies against using gpt like there's a contentious kind of tension of course yeah yeah yeah but they're trying to still figure that out and so we we are similar in that regard like obviously all the things we've talked about like chatgpd makes stuff up and it makes up references so our community has already put into place some policies about it but roughly speaking there's always more nuance but roughly speaking it's sort of like you the human are responsible for what you put into wikipedia so if you use chatgpt you you better check it because there's a lot of great use cases of you know like oh well i'm i'm not a native speaker of german by kind of i'm pretty good i'm not talking about myself a hypothetical mean it's pretty good and i kinda just wanna run my edit through chat gpt in german to go make sure my grammar is okay that's actually cool does it make you sad that people might use increasingly use chargegpt for something where they would previously use wikipedia so basically use it to answer basic questions about the eiffel tower yeah no and where the answer really comes at the source of it from wikipedia but they're using this as an interface yeah no no that's completely fine i mean part of it is our ethos has always been here's our gift to the world make something so if if the knowledge is more accessible to people even if they're not coming through us that's fine now obviously we do have certain business model concerns right like if and we've talked where we've had more conversation about this this whole gpt thing is new things like if you ask alexa you know what is the eiffel tower and she reads you the first two sentences from wikipedia and doesn't say it's from wikipedia and they've recently started citing wikipedia then we worry like oh if people don't know they're getting the knowledge from us are they gonna donate money or are they just thinking oh what's wikipedia for i can just ask alexa it's like well alexa only knows anything because she read wikipedia so we do think about that but it doesn't bother me in the sense of like oh i want people always come to wikipedia first but we're also you know had a great demo like literally just hacked together over a weekend by our head of machine learning where he did this little thing to say you you could ask any question and he was just knocking it together so he used the openai's api just to make a demo asking a question why do ducks fly south for winter mhmm so the kind of thing you think oh i i i might just google for that i might start looking in wikipedia i don't know and so what he does he asked chachapiti what are some wikipedia entries that might answer this then he grabbed those wikipedia entries said here's some wikipedia entries answer this question based only on the information in in this and he had pretty good results and it kind of prevented the making stuff up now it's just a he hacked together the weekend but what it made me think about was oh okay so now we've got this huge body of knowledge that in many cases you're like oh i i'm really i wanna know about queen victoria i'm just gonna go read the wikipedia entry and it's gonna take me through her life and and so forth but other times you've got a specific question and maybe we could have a better search experience where you can come to wikipedia ask your specific question get your specific answer that's from wikipedia including links to the articles you might wanna read next and that's just a step forward like that's just using a new type of technology to make the extraction of information from this body of text into my brain faster and easier so i think that's kinda cool i i would love to see a chad gpt grounding into websites like wikipedia and the other comparable website to me will be like wolfram alpha for more mathematical knowledge that kind of stuff so grounding like taking you to a page that is really crafted yeah as opposed to like the moment you start actually taking you to like journalist websites like news websites it starts getting a little iffy yeah yeah it's getting a little yeah yeah yeah i because they have you're you're now in a land that has a wrong incentive right yeah you pulled in and you need somebody to have filtered through that and sort of tried to knock off the rough edges yeah no it's it's very i think that's exactly right and i think you know i i think that kind of grounding is i think they're working really hard on it i think that's really important and that actually when i so if we if you ask me to step back and be like very businesslike about our business model and where is it gonna go for us and are we gonna lose half our donations because everybody's just gonna stop coming to wikipedia and go to chigpt i think well grounding will help a lot because frankly most questions people have if they provide proper links we're gonna be at the top of that just like we are in google so we're still gonna get tons of recognition and tons of traffic just from even if it's just the moral properness of saying here's my source so i think i think we're gonna be alright in that in that way yeah and the close partnership of if the if the model is fine tuned is constantly retrained then wikipedia is one of the primary places where if you want to change what the model knows one of the things you should do is contribute to wikipedia or clarify wikipedia yeah yeah no that's true or elaborate expand all that kind of stuff yeah you mentioned all of us have controversies i have to ask do you find the controversy of whether you are the sole founder or the cofounder of wikipedia ironic absurd interesting important what are your comments so i would say unimportant not that interesting i mean one of the things that people are sometimes surprised to hear me say is i actually think larry sanger doesn't get enough credit for his early work in wikipedia even though i think cofounder is not the right title for that so you know like he had a lot of impact and a lot of great work and i disagree about a lot of things since and all that and that's fine so yeah no to me that's like it's one of these things that the media love a falling out story mhmm so they wanna make a big deal out of it and i'm just like yeah no so there's a lot of interesting engineering contributions in the early days like you were saying there's debates about how to structure it how what what the heck is this thing that we're doing and there's important people that contributed to that yeah definitely so he also you said you've had some disagreements larry sanger said that nobody should trust wikipedia and that wikipedia seems to assume that there's only one legitimate defensible version of the truth on any controversial question that's not how wikipedia used to be i presume you disagree with that analysis let me just straight up i disagree like go and read any wikipedia entry on a controversial topic and what you'll see is a really diligent effort to explain all the relevant sides so yeah just disagree so on controversial questions do you think perspectives are generally represented i mean they're because it's it has to do with the kind of the tension between the mainstream and the non mainstream that we were talking about yeah no i mean for sure like to take this area of discussion seriously is to say yeah you know what actually that is a big part of what wikipedians spend their time grappling with is to say how do we figure out whether a a less popular view is pseudoscience is it just a less popular view that's gaining acceptance in the mainstream is it fringe versus crackpot etcetera etcetera and that debate is what you've gotta do there's no choice about having that debate of grappling with something and i think we do and i think that's really important and i think if anybody said to the wikipedia community gee you should stop you know sort of covering minority viewpoints on this issue i think they would say i don't even understand why why you would say that like we have to sort of grapple with minority viewpoints in science and politics and so on but it's and and like this is one of the reasons why you know there is no magic simple answer to all these things it's really contextual it's case by case it's like you know you've gotta really say okay what is the context here how do you do it and and you've always gotta be open to correction and to change and to sort of challenge and always be sort of serious about that i think what happens again with social media is when when there is that grappling process in wikipedia and a decision is made to remove a paragraph or to remove a thing or to say a thing you're gonna notice the one one direction of the oscillation of the grappling and not the correction yeah and you're gonna highlight that and say how did how come this person yeah i don't know i want maybe legitimacy of elections that's the thing that comes up donald trump maybe a previous i can give a really good example which is there was this sort of dust up about the definition of recession in wikipedia so the accusation was and the accusation was often quite ridiculous and extreme which is under pressure from the biden administration wikipedia changed the definition of recession to make biden look good or we did it not under pressure but because we're a bunch of lunatic leftists and so on and then you know when i see something like that in the press i'm like oh dear like what's happened here how did we do that because i always just accept things for five seconds first and then i go and i look and i'm like you know what that's literally completely not what happened mhmm what happened was one editor thought the article needed restructuring so the article is always said so the the traditional kind of loose definition of recession is two quarters of negative growth but there's always been within economics within important agencies in different countries around the world a lot of nuance around that and there's other like factors that interesting complicated topic and so the article has always had the definition of two quarters the only thing that really changed was moving that from the lead from the top paragraph to further down and then news stories appeared saying wikipedia's changed the definition of recession and then we got a huge rush of trolls coming in so the article was temporarily protected i think only semi protected and people were told go to the talk page to discuss so it was a the dust up that was you know when you look at it as a wikipedia and you're like oh like this is a really routine kind of editorial debate another example which unfortunately our friend elon fell for i would say is the the twitter files so there was an article called the twitter files which is about these files that were released once elon took control of twitter and he released internal documents and the what happened was somebody nominated it for deletion but even the nomination said this is actually this is mainly about the hunter biden laptop controversy shouldn't this information be there instead so anyone can like it takes exactly one human being anywhere on the planet to propose something for deletion and that triggers a process where people discuss it which within a few hours it was what we call snowball closed i e this doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of passing so an admin goes yeah wrong yeah and closed the debate and that was it that was the whole thing that happened and so nobody proposed suppressing the information nobody proposed it wasn't important it was just like editorially boring internal question and you know so sometimes people read stuff like that and they're like oh you see look at these leftists they're trying to suppress the truth again it's like well slow down a second and come and look like literally it's not what happened yeah so i think the right is more sensitive to censorship and so they they will more likely highlight there's more virality to highlighting something that looks like censorship in any walks of life and this moving a paragraph from one place to another or removing it and so on as part of the regular grappling of wikipedia can make a hell of a good article or a good video yeah yeah yeah so it it sounds really enticing and and intriguing and surprising to most people because they're like i'm reading wikipedia it doesn't seem like a crackpot leftist website it seems pretty kind of dull really in its own geeky way well that's how i so that makes a good story it's like oh am i being misled because there's a shadowy cabal of jimmy wales you know i generally i read political stuff i i mentioned to you that i'm traveling to have some very difficult conversation with high profile figures both in the war in ukraine and in israel and palestine and you know i read the wikipedia articles around that and i also read books on the conflict and the history of the different regions and i find the wikipedia articles to be very balanced and there's many perspectives being represented but then i ask myself well am i one of them leftist crackpots they can't see the true i mean it's something i ask myself all the time forget the leftist crackpot am i am i just being a sheep and accepting it and i think that's an important question to always ask but not too much yeah no i i agree a little bit but not too much no i think we always have to challenge ourselves of like what what do i potentially have wrong well you mentioned pressure from government you've you've criticized twitter for the allowing giving in to turkey's government censorship there's also conspiracy theories or accusations of wikipedia being open to pressure from government to government organizations fbi and all this kind of stuff is the right what is the philosophy about pressure from government and censorship so so we're super hardcore on this we've never bowed down to government pressure anywhere in the world and we never will and we understand that we're hardcore and actually there is a bit of nuance about how different companies respond to this but our response has always been just to say no and if they threaten to block well knock yourself out you're gonna lose wikipedia and that's been very successful for us as a strategy because governments know they can't just casually threaten to block wikipedia or block us for two days and we're gonna cave in immediately to get back into the market and that's what a lot of companies have done and i don't think that's good we can go one level deeper and say i'm actually quite sympathetic like if you have staff members in a certain country and they are at physical risk you've got to put that into your equation so i understand that like if if elon said actually i've got a hundred staff members on the ground in such and such a country and if we don't comply somebody's gonna get arrested and it could be quite serious okay that's a tough one right that's that's actually really hard but yeah no and then the fbi one no no we like the criticism i saw i kinda prepared for this because i saw people responding to your request for questions and i was like somebody's like oh don't you think it was really bad that you and i was like i actually reached out to steph like can you just make sure i've got my facts right and the answer is we received zero requests of any kind from the fbi or any of the other government agencies for any changes to content in wikipedia and had we received those requests at the level of the wikimedia foundation we would have said it's not our like we can't do anything because wikipedia is written by the community and so the wikimedia foundation can't change the content of wikipedia without causing i mean god that would be a massive controversy you can't even imagine what we did do and this is what i've done i've i've been to china and met with the minister of propaganda we've had discussions with governments all around the world not because we wanna do their bidding but because we don't wanna do their bidding but we also don't wanna be blocked and we think actually having these conversations are really important now there's no threat of being blocked in the us us like that's just never gonna happen there is the first amendment but in other countries around the world it's like okay what are you upset about let's have the conversation like let's understand and let's have a dialogue about it so that you can understand where we come from and what we're doing and why and then you know some sometimes it's like gee like if somebody complains that something's bad in wikipedia whoever they are don't care who they are could be you could be the government could be the pope i don't care who they are it's like oh okay well our responsibility as wikipedia is to go oh hold on let's check right is that right or wrong is there something that we've got wrong in wikipedia not because you're threatening to block us but because we want wikipedia to be correct so we do have these dialogues with people and you know a big part of like what was going on with you might call it pressure on social media companies or dialogue with depending on you know as we talked earlier grapple with the language depending on what your view is in our case it was really just about oh okay right they wanna have a dialogue about covid information misinformation we are this enormous source of information which the world depends on we're gonna have that conversation right we're happy to say here's you know if they say how do you know that wikipedia is not gonna be pushing some crazy anti vax narrative first i mean i think it's somewhat inappropriate for a government to be asking pointed questions in a way that implies possible penalties i'm not sure that ever happened because we would just go i don't know the chinese blocked us and so so it goes right we're not gonna cave in to any kind of government pressure but whatever the appropriateness of what they were doing i think there is a role for government in just saying let's understand the information ecosystem let's think about the problem of misinformation disinformation in society particularly around election security all these kinds of things so you know i think it would be irresponsible of us to get a call from a government agency and say yeah why don't you just fuck off you're the government but it would also be irresponsible to go oh dear government agents are not happy let's fix wikipedia so that the fbi loves this so you know when you say you you wanna have discussions with the chinese government or with organizations like cdc and who it's to thoroughly understand what the mainstream narrative is so that it can be properly represented but not drive what the articles are well it's actually important to say like whatever the wikimedia foundation thinks has no impact on what's in wikipedia right so it's more about saying to them right we understand you're the world health organization or you're whoever and part of your job is to sort of public health is about communications you wanna understand the world so it's more about oh well let's explain how wikipedia works so it's more about explaining how wikipedia works and like hey it's the volunteers yeah yeah you it's a it's a battle of ideas and here's how yes the sources are used yeah exactly what are the legitimate sources and what not a legitimate source is yeah exactly i mean i i suppose there's some battle about what is a legitimate source there could be statements made that cdc i mean like there's a government organizations in general have sold themselves to be the place where you go for expertise mhmm and some of that has been to small degree raised in question over the response to the pandemic i i think in many cases and this goes back to my topic of trust so there were definitely cases of public officials public organizations where i felt like they lost the trust of the public because they didn't trust the public yeah and so the idea is like we really need people to take this seriously and take actions therefore we're gonna put out some overblown claims because it's gonna scare people into behaving correctly you know what that might work for a little while but it doesn't work in the long run because suddenly people go from a default stance of like the center for disease control very well respected scientific organization sort of i don't know they've got fault in atlanta with the last vial of smallpox or whatever it is that people think about them and to go oh right these are scientists we should actually take seriously and listen to and they're not politicized and they're you know it's like okay and if you put out statements and i don't know if the cdc did but health organization whoever that are provably false and also provably you kind of knew they were false but you did it to scare people because you wanted them to do the right thing it's like no you know what that's not gonna work in the long run like you're gonna lose people and now you've got a bigger problem which is a lack of trust in science a lack of trust in authorities who are you know by and large they're like quite boring government bureaucrat scientists who just are trying to help the world well i i've been criticized and i've been torn on this i've been criticized for criticizing anthony fauci too hard the degree to which i criticized him is because he's a leader and i'm just observing the effect in the loss of trust in the institutions like the nih that where i personally know there's a lot of incredible scientists doing incredible work yeah and i have to blame the leaders for the effects on the distrust in the scientific work that they're doing because of what i perceive as basic human flaws of communication of arrogance of ego of politics all those kinds of things now you could say you're being too harsh possible but i think that's the whole point of free speech is you can criticize the lead people who lead leaders unfortunately or fortunately are responsible for the effects on society i to me anthony fauci or whoever in the scientific position around the pandemic had an opportunity to have a fdr moment or to get everybody together inspire about the power of science to rapidly develop a vaccine that saves us from this pandemic and future pandemic that can threaten the well-being of human civilization this was epic and awesome and sexy and to me when i talk to people about science it's anything but sexy in terms of the virology and biology development because it's been politicized it's inky yeah and people just don't wanna like i don't talk to me about the vaccine i i understand i understand i got vaccinated there's just let's switch topics right yeah yeah yeah yeah well it's interesting because i as i said i i live in the uk and i think it's all these things are a little less politicized there and i i haven't paid close enough attention to fauci to have a really strong view i'm sure i would disagree with some things i definitely you know i remember hearing at the beginning of the pandemic as i'm unwrapping my amazon package with these masks i bought because i heard there's a pandemic and i just was like i want some n ninety five mask please and they were saying don't buy masks and the motivation was because they didn't want there to be shortages in hospitals yeah fine but they were also statements of masks won't they're not effective and they won't help you and then the complete about phase two you're you're ridiculous if you're not wearing them you know it's just like no like that that about face just lost people from day one the distrust and the and the intelligence of the public to deal with nuance to deal with the uncertainty yeah this is exactly what you know i think this is where the wikipedia neutral point of view is and and should be an ideal and obviously every article and everything we could you know me now and you know how i am about these things but ideally it's to say look we're happy to show you all the perspectives this is planned parenthood's view and this is catholic church view and we're gonna explain that and we're gonna try to be thoughtful and and put in the best arguments from all sides because i trust you like you read that and you're gonna be more educated and you're gonna begin to make a decision i mean i can just talk in the uk the government when we found out in the uk that very high level government officials were not following the rules they had put on everyone else yeah i moved from i had just become a a uk citizen just a little while before the pandemic and you know it's kind of emotional like you get a passport in a new country and you feel quite good and i did my oath to the queen and then they dragged the poor old lady out to tell us all to be good and i was like we're british and we're gonna do the right things and and you know it's gonna be tough but we're gonna you know so you have that kind of dunkirk spirit moment and you're like following the rules to a tee and then suddenly it's like well they're not following the rules yeah and so suddenly i shifted personally from i'm gonna follow the rules even if i don't completely agree with them i'll still follow because i think we've got all chimping together to like you know what i'm gonna make wise and thoughtful decisions for myself and my family and that generally is gonna mean following the rules but it's basically you know when they're you know at certain moments in time like you're not allowed to be in an outside space unless you're exercising i'm like i think i can sit in a park and read a book yeah like it's gonna be fine like that's irrational rule which i would have been following just personally of like i'm just gonna do the right thing yeah and the loss of trust i think at scale was probably harmful to science and to me the the scientific method and the the scientific community is is one of the biggest hopes at least to me for the survival and the thriving of human civilization absolutely and i you know i think you see some of the ramifications of this there's always been like pretty anti science anti vaxx people okay that's always been a thing but i feel like it's bigger now simply because of that lowering of trust so a lot of people yeah maybe it's like you say a lot of people are like yeah i got vaccinated but i really don't wanna talk about this because it's so toxic you know and that's unfortunate because i think people should say what what an amazing thing and you know there's also a whole range of discourse around if this were a disease that were primarily that was primarily killing babies i think people's emotions about it would have been very different right or wrong than the fact that when you really looked at the the sort of death rate of getting covid wow it's really dramatically different if you're if you're late in life this was really dangerous and if you're twenty three years old yeah well it's not great like and long covid's a thing and all of that but and i think some of the public communications again were failing to properly contextualize it not all of it you know it's a complicated matter but yeah let me read you a reddit comment that received two likes oh and two whole people liked it yeah two people liked it and i don't know maybe you can comment on whether there's truth to it but i just found it interesting because i've been doing a lot of research on world war two recently so this is about hitler oh go ahead here's it's a long it's a long statement i was there when a big push was made to fight bias at wikipedia our target became getting the hitler article to be wiki's featured article the idea was that the voting body only wanted articles that were good pr and especially articles about socially liberal topics so the hitler article had to be two to three times better and more academically researched to beat the competition this bias seems to hold today for example the current list of political featured articles at a glance seems to have only two books one on anarchism and one on karl marx surely we're not going to say there have only ever been two articles about political non biography books worth being featured especially compared to two hundred plus video games that's the only topics with with good books are socialism and anarchy would do you have any interesting comments on this kind of oh yeah featured yeah how the featured is selected maybe hitler because he's a special he's a special figure you know i'm not i love i love that no i i i love the comparison to how many video games that and that definitely speaks to my earlier as like if you've got a lot of young geeky men yeah who really like video games that doesn't necessarily give get you the right place in every respect certainly yeah so here's a funny story i woke up one morning to a bunch of journalists in germany trying to get in touch with me because german language wikipedia chose to have as the featured article of the day swastika people were going crazy about it and some people were saying it's illegal has german wikipedia been taken over by nazi sympathizers and so on and it turned out it's not illegal like discussing the swastika using the swastika as a political campaign and using in certain ways is illegal in germany in a way that it wouldn't be in the us because of first amendment but in this case it was like actually part of the point is the swastika symbol is from other cultures as well and and they just thought it was interesting and i did joke to the community i'm like please don't put the swastika on the front page without warning me because i'm gonna get a lot of now it wouldn't be me it's the foundation i'm not i'm not that much on the front lines so i would say that to put hitler on the front page of wikipedia it is a special topic and you would wanna say yeah let's be really careful that it's really really good before we do that because if we put it on the front page and it's got and it's not good enough that could be a problem there's no inherent reason like clearly world war two is a very popular topic in wikipedia it's like turn on the history channel like people it's a fascinating period of history that people are very interested in and then on the other piece like anarchism and karl marx or no karl marx yeah oh yeah i mean that's interesting i'm surprised to hear that not more political books or topics have made it to the front page now we're taking this reddit comment i mean as it's completely as it's valid yeah but i'm trusting so i think that's probably is right they probably did have the list up no i think it's i think that piece the the piece about how many of those featured articles have been video games and if it's disproportionate yeah i think we should the community should go actually what's gone like that doesn't seem quite right mhmm you know i mean you can imagine that because you're looking for an article to be on the front page of wikipedia you you wanna have a bit of diversity in it you want it to be not always something that's really popular that week so like i don't know the last couple of weeks maybe succession a big finale of succession succession might lead you think oh let's put succession on the front page that's gonna be popular in other cases you'd you'd kinda want pick something super obscure and quirky because people also find that interesting and fun so yeah don't know but you don't want it to be video games most of the time that sounds quite bad well let me ask you just for as somebody who's seen the whole thing the the development of the millions of articles big impossible question what's your favorite article my my favorite article well i've got a an amusing answer mhmm which is possibly also true there's an article in wikipedia called inherently funny words and one of the reasons i love it is when it was created early in in the history of wikipedia it kinda became like a dumping ground people would just come by and write in any word that they thought sounded funny mhmm and and then it was nominated for deletion because somebody's like this is just a dumping ground like people are putting all kinds of nonsense in and in that deletion debate somebody came forward and said essentially wait a second hold on this is actually a legitimate concept in the theory of humor and comedy and a lot of famous comedians and humorists have written about it mhmm and it's you know it's actually a legitimate topic so then they went through and they meticulously referenced every word that was in there and threw out a bunch that weren't and so it becomes this really interesting now my biggest disappointment and it's the right decision to make because there was no source but it was a picture of a cow mhmm but there was a rope around its head mhmm tying on some horns mhmm onto the cow so it was kind of a funny looking picture it looked like you know like a bull you know with horns but it's just like a normal milk cow and below it the caption said according to some cow is an inherently funny word which is just hilarious to me partly because the according to some sounds a lot like wikipedia but there was no source so it went away and i i feel very sad about that but i've always liked that and i actually the the reason depths of wikipedia amuses me so greatly is because it does like highlight really interesting obscure stuff and you're like wow i can't believe somebody wrote about that in wikipedia it's quite amusing and sometimes there's a bit of wry humor in wikipedia there's always a struggle you're not trying to be funny yeah but occasionally a little inside humor can be quite healthy and apparently words with the letter k are funny yeah there's there's a lot of really well researched stuff on this page it's it's it's yeah yeah actually exciting and i should mention for the depths of the wikipedia it's run by annie ruwerda that's right annie and they said let me just read off some of the pages octopus and octolantis oh yeah that was are are two separate nonhuman underwater settlements built by the gloomy octopuses in jervis bay east australia the first settlement named octopus by biologists was founded in two thousand nine the individual structures in the octopus consist of burrows around a piece of human the treatise believed to be scrap metal and it goes on in this way that's great satiric misspelling least concerned species humans were formally assessed as a species of least concern in in in two thousand eight i think hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy would slightly disagree friend and last one let me just say friendship paradox is the phenomena first observed by the sociologist scott feld in nineteen ninety one that on average an individual's friends have more friends than that individual oh that's pretty much lonely that isn't that that that's the kind of thing that makes you wanna like it sounds implausible at first because shouldn't everybody have on average about the same number of friends as all their friends so you really wanna dig into the math of that and really think oh why would that be true and it's one way to feel more lonely in a mathematically rigorous way yeah somebody also on reddit asks i would love to hear some war stories from behind the scenes is there something that we haven't mentioned that was particularly difficult in this entire journey you you were on with with wikipedia i mean it's hard to say i mean so part of what i always say about myself is that i'm a pathological optimist so i always think everything is fine and so things that other people might find a struggle i'm just like oh well this is the thing we're doing today so that's kind of about me and it's actually i'm aware of this about myself so i do like to have a few pessimistic people around me to keep me a bit on balance yeah i mean i would say some of the some of the hard things i mean there were there were hard moments like when two out of three servers crash on christmas day and then we needed to do a fundraiser and no idea what was gonna happen i would say as well the like in in that early period of time the growth of the website and the traffic to the community was fine and then the wikimedia foundation the nonprofit i set up to own and operate wikipedia as a small organization it had a lot of growing pains and it was like that was the piece that's just like many companies or many organizations that are in a fast growth it's like you've hired the wrong people or there's this conflict that's arisen and nobody's got experience to do this and all that so no specific stories to tell but you know like i would say growing the organization was harder than growing the community and growing the website which is interesting well yeah it's kinda miraculous and inspiring that a community can emerge and be stable and that does has so much kind of productive positive output it kinda makes you think i mean i don't it's one of those things you don't wanna analyze too much mhmm because like you you don't wanna you you don't wanna mess with a beautiful thing but it gives me faith in communities yeah yeah that just they can spring up in other domains as well yeah i think that's exactly right and you know at fandom my for profit company where you know it's like all these communities about pop culture mainly entertainment gaming and so on there's a lot of small communities and so i went last year to our community connect conference and just met some of these people and like you know here's one of the leaders of the star wars wiki which is called wookieepedia which i think is great and you know he's telling me about his community and all that and i'm like oh right yeah i love this like so it's not it's not the same purpose as wikipedia of a neutral high quality encyclopedia but a lot of the same values are there of like oh people should be nice to each other it's like when people get upset it's it's like just remember we're working on star wars wiki together like there's no reason to get too outraged and just kind people just like geeky people with a hobby where do you see wikipedia in ten years one hundred years mhmm and one thousand years dun dun dun right so ten years i would say pretty much the same like we're not gonna have we're not gonna become tiktok you know with entertainment you know scroll by video humor and blah blah blah an encyclopedia i think in ten years we probably will have a lot more ai supporting tools like i've talked about and probably your search experience would be you can ask a question and get the answer rather than you know from our body of work so search and discovery a little bit improved interface some of the all that i always say one of the things that people most people won't notice because already they don't notice it is the growth of wikipedia in the languages of the developing world so you probably don't speak swahili so you're probably not checking out that swahili wikipedia is doing very well and it is doing very well and i think that kind of growth is actually super important it's super interesting but most people won't notice that if we can just look on that yeah if we could do you think there's so much incredible translation work is being done with with ai with language models do you think that can accelerate yeah wikipedia so you start with a basic draft of the translation of articles and then yeah so so what i used to say is like machine translation for many years wasn't much use to the community because it just wasn't good enough as it's gotten better it's tended to be a lot better in what we might call economically important languages that's because the corpus that they train on and all of that so to translate from english to spanish if you've tried google translate recently spanish to english is what i would do it's pretty good i think it's actually not bad it used to be half a joke and then for a while it was kinda like well you can get the gist of something and now it's like actually it's pretty good however we've got a huge spanish community who write in native spanish so they're able to use it and they find it useful but they're writing but if you tried to do english to zulu where there's not that much investment like there's loads of reasons to invest in english to spanish because they're both huge economically important languages zulu not so much so for those smaller languages it was just still terrible my understanding is it's improved dramatically and also because the new methods of training don't necessarily involve identical corpuses to try to match things up but rather reading and understanding with tokens and large language models and then reading and understanding and then you get a much richer anyway apparently it's quite improved so i think that now it is quite possible that these smaller language communities are gonna say oh well finally i can put something in an english and i can get out zulu that i can that i feel comfortable sharing with my community because it's actually good enough or i can edit it a bit here and there so i think that's huge so i do think that's gonna happen a lot and that's gonna accelerate again what will remain to most people in an invisible trend but that's the growth in in all these other languages so then move on to a hundred years i was starting to get scary well the only thing i say about a hundred years is like we've built the wikimedia foundation and we run it in a quite cautious and financially conservative and careful way so every year we build our reserves every year we put aside a little bit more money we also have the endowment fund which we just passed one hundred million that's a completely separate fund with a separate board so that it's not just like a big fat bank account for some future profligate ceo to blow through the foundation will have to get the approval of a second order board to be able to access that money and that board can make other grants through the community and things like that so the point of all that is i hope and believe that we are building you know in a financially stable way that we can weather various storms along the way so that hopefully we we're not we're not taking the kind of risks and by the way we're not taking too few risks either that's always hard i think we'll the wikimedia foundation and wikipedia will exist in a hundred years if anybody exists in a hundred years we'll be there you think the internet just looks unpredictably different just the the web i do i do i mean i think right now this sort of enormous step forward we've seen and has become public in the last year of the large language models really is something else right it's really interesting and you and i have both talked today about the flaws and the limitations but still as someone who's been around technology for a long time it's sort of that feeling of the first time i saw a web browser the first time i saw the iphone like the first time the internet was like really usable on a phone and it's like wow that's that's a step change difference there's a few other you know maybe a google search google search was actually the first search because i remember altavista was kinda cool for a while then it just got more and more useless because the algorithm wasn't good and it's like oh google search now like the internet works again yeah and so large language model it feels like that to me like oh wow this is this is something new and like really pretty remarkable and it's gonna have some downsides like you know the the negative use case you know people in the area who are experts they're they're giving a lot of warnings and i don't know enough to i'm not that worried but i'm a pathological optimist but i i do see some like really low hanging fruit bad things that can happen so my example is how about some highly customized spam where the the email that you receive isn't just like misspelled words and like trying to get through filters but actually is a targeted email to you that knows something about you by reading your linkedin profile and writes a plausible email that will get through the filters and it's like suddenly oh that's that's a new problem that's gonna be interesting is there a just on the wikipedia editing side does it make the job of the volunteer of the editor more difficult if in a world where larger and larger percentage of the internet is written by an llm so one of my predictions and we'll see you know ask me again in five years how this panned out is that in a way this will strengthen the value and importance of some traditional brands yeah so if i see a a news story and it's from the wall street journal from the new york times from fox news i know what i'm getting and i trust it to whatever extent i might have you know trust or distrust in any of those and if i see a brand new website that looks plausible but i've never heard of it and it could be machine generated content that may be full of errors i think i'll be more cautious i think i'm more interested and we can also talk about this around photographic evidence so obviously there will be scandals where major media organizations get fooled by a fake photo however if i see a photo of the the recent was the the pope wearing an expensive puffer jacket i'm gonna go yeah that's amazing that a fake like that could be generated but my immediate thought is not i don't know so the pope's dipping into the money partly because this particular pope doesn't seem like he'd be the type my favorite is extensive pictures of joe biden and donald trump hanging out and having fun together yeah yeah brilliant so i think i think people will care about the provenance of a photo and if if you show me a photo and you say yeah this this photo is from fox news even though i don't necessarily think that's the highest but i'm like wow it's a news organization and they're gonna have journalists and they're gonna make sure the photo is what it's purports to be that's very different from a photo randomly circulating on twitter whereas i would say fifteen years ago a photo randomly circulating on twitter in most cases the the worst you could do and this did happen is misrepresent the battlefield so like oh here's a bunch of injured children look what israel's done but actually it wasn't israel it was another case ten years ago that has happened that has always been around but now we can have much more specifically constructed plausible looking photos that if i just see them circulating on twitter i'm gonna go just don't know not sure like i can make that in five minutes so well i also hope that it's kinda like what you're writing about in your book that we could also have citizen journalists that have a stable verifiable trust that builds up yeah so it doesn't have to be new york times or this organization that you could be in an organization of one as long as it's stable and carries through time and it builds up or builds up no no i i agree but the one thing i've i've said in the past and this is this depends on who that person is and what they're doing but it's like i think my credibility my general credibility in the world should be the equal of a new york times reporter yeah so if something happens and i witness it and i write about it people are gonna go well jimmy wales said it that's just like if a new york times reporter said it like i'm gonna tend to think he didn't just make it up truth is nothing interesting ever happens around me i don't go to war zones i don't go to big press conferences i don't interview putin and zelensky right so just to an extent yes whereas i do think for other people those those traditional models of credibility are really really important and then there there is this sort of citizen journalism i don't i don't know if you think of what you do as journalism i kind of think it is but yeah you do interviews you do long form interviews and i think people you know like if you come and you say right here's my tape but you wouldn't hand out a tape like i just gestured you as if i'm handing you a cassette tape but if you put it into your podcast here's my interview with zelensky and people aren't gonna go yeah how do we know that could be a deep fake yeah like you could have faked that because people are like well no like you're a well known podcaster and you do interview interesting people and yeah you'd like you wouldn't think that so that your brand becomes really important whereas if suddenly and i've seen this already i've seen sort of video with subtitles in english and apparently the ukrainian was the same and it was zelensky saying something really outrageous and i'm like yeah i don't believe that like i don't think he said that in a meeting with you know whatever i think that's russian propaganda or probably just trolls yeah and then then building platforms and mechanisms of how that trust can be verified yeah you know if something appears in a wikipedia page that means something if something appears on like say my twitter account that means something that means yeah i this particular human have signed off on it yeah exactly and then you the the the the trust you have in this particular human transfers to the piece of content and then each yep hopefully there's millions of people with different metrics of trust yeah and then you could see that there's a certain kind of bias in the set of conversations you're having so maybe okay i i trust this person i have this kind of bias and i'll go to this other person of this other kind of bias and i can integrate them in this kind of way just like you said with fox news and what the rest of your time times like they've all got their like where they sit yeah so you have built i would say one of if not the most impactful website in the history of human civilization so let me ask for you to give advice to young people how to have impact in this world high schoolers college students yeah wanting to have a big positive impact in the world right if you wanna be successful do something you're really passionate about rather than some kind of cold calculation of what can make you the most money because if you go and try to do something and you're like i'm not that interested but i'm gonna make a lot of money doing it you're probably not gonna be that good at it mhmm and so that that is a big piece of it i i also like you know so for startups i i give this advice so young and this is a career start up any kind of like young person just starting out is like you know be persistent right there'll be moments when it's not working out and you can't just give up too easily you've gotta persist through some hard times maybe two servers crash on a sunday and you've gotta sorta scramble to figure it out but persist through that and then also be prepared to pivot that's a newer word new for me but when i pivoted from nupedia to wikipedia it's like this isn't working i've got to completely change so be willing to completely change direction when something's not working now the problem with these two wonderful pieces of advice is which situation am i in today mhmm right is this a moment when i need to just power through and persist because i'm gonna find a way to make this work or is this a moment where i needed to go actually this is totally not working and i need to change direction but also i think for me that always gives me a framework of like okay let's okay here's a problem do we need to change direction or do we need to kind of power through it and just knowing like those are the choices and they're not always the only choices but those are choices i think it can be helpful to say okay am i am i am i checking it out like because i'm having a little bump and i'm feeling an emotional and i'm just gonna give up too soon okay ask yourself that question and also it's like am i being pigheaded and trying to do something that actually doesn't make sense okay ask yourself that question too even though they're contradictory questions sometimes it'll be one sometimes it'll be the other and you gotta really think it through i think persisting with the business model behind wikipedia is such an inspiring story because we live in a in a capitalist world we we live in a in a scary world i think for an internet business and so yeah and so like to do things differently than a lot of websites are doing like what wikipedia has lived through the successive explosion of many websites that are basically ad driven google is ad driven facebook twitter all of these websites are ad driven and and and i to see them succeed become these like incredibly rich powerful companies that if i could just have that money you would think as as somebody running wikipedia i could do so much positive stuff right and so to persist through that is i think is from my perspective now monday monday night quarterback or whatever is it this is the right decision but boy was it is that a tough decision it seemed easy at the time so and then you just kinda stay with it yeah just stay with it it's working so on that one you chose persistent yeah well yeah i mean i i always like to give an example of myspace because i just think it's an amusing story so myspace was poised i would say to be facebook right it was huge it was viral it was lots of things kind of foreshadowed a bit of maybe even tiktok because it was like a lot of entertainment content casual and then rupert murdoch bought it and it collapsed within a few years and part of that i think was because they were really really heavy on ads and less heavy on the customer experience so i remember to accept a friend request was like three clicks where you saw three ads mhmm and on facebook except the friend request you didn't even leave the page it just like that just accepted but what is interesting so i used to give this example of like oh well rupert murdoch really screwed that that one up and in a sense maybe he did but somebody said you know what actually he bought it for and i don't remember the numbers he bought it for eight hundred million and it was very profitable through its decline he actually made his money back and more so it wasn't like from a financial point of view it was a bad investment in the sense of you could have been facebook but on sort of more mundane metrics it's like actually it worked out okay for you it all matters how you define success it does and that that is also advice to young people one of the things i i would say like when we have our mental models of success as an entrepreneur for example and your examples in your mind are bill gates mark zuckerberg so people who at a very young age had one really great idea that just went straight to the moon and became one of the richest people in the world that is really unusual like really really rare and for most entrepreneurs that is not the life path you're gonna take you're gonna fail you're gonna reboot you're gonna learn from what you failed at you're gonna try something different and that is really important because if you if your standard of success is well i feel sad because i'm not as rich as elon musk it's like well so should almost everyone possibly everyone except elon musk is not as rich as elon musk and so that you know like realistically you can set a standard of success even even in a really analysis which i don't recommend of thinking about your financial success it's like if you measure your financial success by thinking about billionaires like that's that's heavy like that's probably not good i don't recommend it whereas like i personally i you know like for me when people when journalists say oh how does it feel to not be a billionaire i usually say i don't know how does it feel to you because they're not but also i'm i'm like i live in london the number of bankers that no one's ever heard of who live in london who make far more money than i ever will is quite a large number and i wouldn't trade my life for theirs at all right because i mine is so interesting like oh right jimmy we need you to go and meet the chinese propaganda minister oh okay that's super interesting like yeah jimmy you know like here's the situation like you can go to this country and and while you're there the president has asked to see you i was like god that's super interesting jimmy you're going to this place and there's a local wikipedia who said do you wanna stay with me and my family and i'm like yeah like that's really cool like i would like to do that that's really interesting i don't do that all the time but i've done it and it's great so like for me that's like arranging your life so that you have interesting experiences is just great well this is more to the question of what wikipedia looks like in a thousand years what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing why are we here human civilization what's the meaning of life yeah i don't think there is a external answer to that question and i should mention that there's a very good wikipedia page on the different philosophies in the meaning of life oh interesting i have to read that and see what i think it's actually neutral and gives a wide oh it's a really good reference to a lot of different philosophies about meaning the twentieth century philosophy in general from from nietzsche to the existentialist to all simone de beauvoir all of them have an idea of meaning they really struggle with it systematically rigorously and that's what the page and obviously a shout out to the hitchhiker's guide and all that comes up yeah yeah yeah no so i i think there's no external answer to that i think it's internal i think we decide what meaning we will have in our lives and what we're gonna do with ourselves and so when i think you know if we're talking about thousand years millions of years yuri milner wrote a book he's a big internet investor guy he wrote a book advocating quite strongly for humans exploring the universe and getting off the planet and he funds projects to like send like using lasers to send little cameras and interesting stuff and he talks a lot in the book about meaning it's like his thing his view is that the purpose of the human species is to broadly survive and get off the planet well i don't agree with everything he has to say because i think that's not a meaning that can motivate most people in their own lives it's like okay great the distances of space are absolutely enormous so i don't know should we build generation ships to to start flying places well that i can't do that and i'm not even if i could even if i'm elon musk and i could devote all my wealth to build i'll be dead on the ship on the way so is that really meaning but i think it's really interesting to think about and and reading his little book it's quite a short little book reading his book it made me it did make me think about wow like this is big like this is not what you think about in your day to day life it's like where is the human species going to be in ten million years and it does make you sort of turn back to earth and say gee let's not destroy the planet like we kinda we're stuck here for at least a while and therefore we should really think about sustainability and i mean one million year sustainability and we don't have all the answer we have nothing close to the answers i'm actually excited about ai in this regard while also bracketing yeah i understand there's also risks and people are terrified of ai but i actually think it is quite interesting this moment in time that we may have in the next fifty years to really really solve some really long term human problems for example in health like the the progress that's being made in cancer treatment because we are able to at scale you know model molecules and and genetics and things like this it gets huge it's really exciting you know so if so if we can hang on for a little while and certain problems that seem completely intractable today like climate change may end up being actually not that hard and we might just might be able to alleviate the full diversity of human suffering for sure yeah and in so doing help increase the chance that we can propagate the flame of human consciousness out into towards the stars and i think another important one if we fail to do that for me is propagating and maintaining the the full diversity and richness and complexity and expansiveness of human knowledge mhmm so if we destroy ourselves it would it would it would make me feel a little bit okay yeah you just if the human now just trickled me to say something really interesting which is when we talked to earlier about translating and using machines to translate we mostly talked about small languages and translating into english but i always like to tell this story of something inconsequential really but there's i was in norway in bergen norway where every year they've got this annual festival called buekor which is young groups drumming and they have a drumming competition it's the seventeen secondtors of the city and they've been doing it for a couple hundred years or whatever they wrote about it in the three languages of norway and then from there it was translated into english into german etcetera etcetera and so what i what i love about that story is what it reminds me is like this machine translation goes both ways and like when you talk about the richness and broadness of human culture we're already seeing some really great pieces of this so like korean soap operas really popular not with me but with people and the ability to you know imagine taking a very famous very popular very well known korean drama and now i mean and i literally mean now we're just about there technologically where we use a machine to redub it in english in an automated way including digitally editing the faces so it doesn't look dubbed and so suddenly you say oh wow like here's here's a piece of you know it's it's the korean equivalent of maybe it's friends as a comedy or maybe it's succession just to be very contemporary it's something that really impacted a lot of people and they really loved it and we have literally no idea what it's about yeah and suddenly it's like wow you know like music street music from wherever in the world can suddenly become accessible to us all in new ways it's so cool it's really exciting to get access to the the richness of culture in in china in the many different subcultures of africa south america one of my unsuccessful arguments with the chinese government is by blocking wikipedia right you aren't just stopping people in china from reading chinese wikipedia and other language versions of wikipedia you're also preventing the chinese people from telling their story so is there a small festival in a small town in china like bue corp i don't know but by the way the people who live in that village that small town of fifty thousand they can't put that in wikipedia and get it translated into other places they can't share their culture and their knowledge and i think for china this should be a somewhat influential argument because china does feel misunderstood in the world it's like okay well there's one way if you wanna help people understand put it in wikipedia that's what people go to when they wanna understand and give the amazing incredible people of china a voice exactly jimmy i thank you so much i'm such a huge fan of everything you've done oh thank you no it's for media great deeply deeply deeply deeply grateful for wikipedia i love it it brings me joy i donate all the time you should donate too it's a huge honor to finally talk with you and it's just just just amazing thank you
