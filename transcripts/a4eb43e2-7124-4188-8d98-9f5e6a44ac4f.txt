stylish i'm feeling sexy this feels like an snl skit what was it when the guy's like looking in the mirror and doing positive affirmations i don't think i've ever looked in the mirror and said boy you're looking sexy today the moment i am i think i'm on a slippery slope to a place i don't wanna be but anyway so i'm obviously doing it just for jokes i it feels comfortable i just like the way it feels i like the way it looks my favorite thing to wear is a suit and tie for more formal or for when i'm doing more serious kinds of engagements like podcasts or presentations or just something i wanna take super seriously and then the most relaxed thing is just a t shirt but in between that is a dress shirt and for dress shirts comfortable sexy dress shirts i go to mizzet and maine i highly

favorite app for learning new things blinkist takes key ideas from thousands of nonfiction books and condenses them down into fifteen minutes you can read or listen to i'm not exactly sure why the pace of this segment of the program is being delivered in an increasingly fast pace i wish i was able to talk this quickly during regular conversation i think people criticize me for speaking too quickly well that's a slip well not a slip but a misstatement i think nobody's ever criticized me for speaking too quickly too much maybe yes too slowly yes boring and monotone yes check check check but not too quickly i think because i'm really thinking on the spot a lot and i like the silence i think the silence between words at least for me helps me think it also helps calm down the pace of the conversation where the other person can think oftentimes the reason i'm talking is not necessarily to express an idea like i really really wanna express an idea but it's really to and express an idea in the service of the conversation in the service of inspiring the other person to build on top of that idea i really don't just want to sound smart or say something that i believe needs to be said most of the time i'm trying to dance i'm trying to be a good dance partner so anyway all that said the fuel the catalyst for the being a good dance partner in conversation is wisdom and i gain some of my wisdom to the small degree that i have it from reading books and you can read them in full or you can read them in part and that's where blinkist comes in really the greatest of all time

let's start with possibly the greatest match in jiu jitsu history your second match against buchesha let's go through the details let's go through the whole thing so the walk leading up to it you always do this walk it's epic walk you post it on instagram hansel posted it on instagram yeah this calm walk towards the mat well let's let's go to that match in particular what's going through your mind you've been away from competition facing probably one of the greatest and at that time many people considered the greatest jiu jitsu competitor of all time in buchecha here's the old man the old timer getting back at out there what were you thinking yeah i think that's the first time since probably i got my black belt that i wasn't the favorite to walk into a fight i have to say like a lot of people thought consider him the favorite i mean understandable you know i was out of competition for a while and he was just winning everything so you know saying about the work like for me you know the fight starts way before the referee say go you know it's the it's all the focus and concentration that i think is very important for me to start before like you know i almost walk blind to the mat many times i passed like great friends and i couldn't see anyone you know they're trying to talk to you and i'm like i'm hundred percent focused on my opponent already i thought that i cannot even see him in front of me so i think that's for me was always very important to try to clear my mind out from everything are you visualizing the opponent or not as clearing not at that not at that time is there what's what's in your head is it like a calm river with birds chirping what what it's blank just blank blank just blank yeah darkness okay and that's what we see in that calmness it's just blankness how hard is it to achieve that blankness it's difficult to say because i think i don't remember when i'll say probably as a black belt i try to focus like that not to think because it's probably something you learn is the more you think the more nervous you get and there's nothing that you're gonna gain by thinking of the fight or the possibilities what you know what you can do what can go wrong what can go right because it's unpredictable you you have absolutely no idea it's impossible to predict the fight and you discover that if you just let those nervous feelings go and empty your mind it actually is pretty effective it is it it it makes you feel better it's you know you you kinda control your motion control the adrenaline on your body up to a level so it it absolutely helps you you know focus in the fight i've learned that in jiu jitsu and in general in life that whenever something feels really shitty you can just like take that thought and not think about it yeah like i do that like on long runs or like a fast run or yeah in jiu jitsu especially now getting older out of shape like that feeling of exhaustion well you can always get to the feeling of exhaustion you could just not think about it yeah not think about being exhausted yeah just and that somehow relaxes you i think maybe in the face of exhaustion all the fears start to creep in maybe your muscles tighten up i don't know this is for the the the amateur jiu jitsu person but it it's kinda funny how you can just take that thought and let go of it so you get as a black belt competitor you get used to you get good at letting go of any thoughts yeah when you mentioned to exhaustion is that's another good example of it it's you know there's a lot of times in the fight you're getting tired and you're getting pretty tired so it's like the last thing you wanna think of it is how tired you are it doesn't matter because it doesn't what are you gonna do quit i mean yeah it doesn't matter it's how tired you are it's yeah there's no value thinking about it there's no value it's you just have to go through it so when you're like you know many minutes into the match and you're slowly moving as you sometimes do tying your belt catching your breath you're not thinking about anything you're trying to let go of the yeah of thinking i'm trying to like to save everything to defy like nothing goes to waste it's you know every move unnecessary is is is just gonna make you more tired or it's gonna take something out of you like you know i try to calculate every single move i make save as much energy as i can so i can fully you know be focused hundred percent in the fight with no way especially energy wise and that's instinctual like minimizing the amount of moves you're not like explicitly thinking should i do this or not you it's just just don't move unless it's absolutely required yeah because fight is you you cannot really there's not really time to think much you know it's like it's it's it's your instincts are playing it's like it's you know you already have your you know your your weapons let's say you know your the the things that you do at it's just to wait for the perfect moment the beauty of it is you know is there's the right moment to everything if you feel one second too late it doesn't work or you get messy so it's you know you're trying to catch that moment that is you know and for that you have to be fully focused in what you're doing because one second you you out it won't work but you're you're not exactly known as somebody that moves super quickly so the so the moment it's not about how quickly you move it's about the right moment so you can move slowly yeah yeah it's not like speed it's not like you have to move the speed of light it's it's it's the move itself at that precise moment it doesn't have to be super fast because your opponent's not moving super fast you know so it's it's it's a combination of moving between you and him i mean the same thing happens in in judo and the movement could be really small yeah i think judo is a is a bit more explosiveness you know it's just a it's the moves are slightly faster so it did no it does require a bit more explosiveness in judo but even just the right timing for an off balance yeah still a little tough yeah yeah it's not that that you know moving the speed is not gonna count that much yeah it's the timing that you initiate that move you see that with foot sweeps there's nothing more beautiful than like a olympic level athlete going at it in the olympics and a perfect sweep and it's just and you see one man's life flash before his eyes and realize like i'm supposed to be the top three person in the world that i just find and they don't they have this look on their face like i don't know what just happened it's beautiful to see you you don't see that i guess you see that in boxing knockouts and stuff like that you don't know what the hell just happened yeah it's that precise moment of movement that you get caught like it's it's that one split second that's it do you get that in jiu jitsu at all because judo has because of the explosiveness because of the point scoring system that that incentivizes these giant throws has these moments where everything just turns in a single moment do you have that in jujitsu too not really because then it's points yes you get like you know two points so it's because we i think regarding the submission it's not just one precise movement that changed everything i think judo is the takedown that counts as a submission like hip on fight over jujutsu don't have that so you will you will score points but i think in terms of submission you need to get to in a dominant position first and then the submission will come slowly it's a process yeah okay let's go back to that guy with with his mind so actually in the weeks leading up to it in the days in the hours in the minutes is there some fear in you leading up to this i mean i'm not gonna say you know that i'm fearless because everybody fears something you know the fear is there but it's like how much you let that control you i think i was a lot more confident than fearful for sure walking to that fight like i i was pretty confident that yeah i could beat him what is the source of that confidence my belief on on on me this okay i can take the word that's you can take anyone in the world but is there a specific strategic like you know talking to donna hart he believes that there's no such thing as confidence like or rather the way you get confidence is through data like that you have proven yourself effective in previous situations but with bouchera you don't you don't have much data it was a very the first time you faced him was a very tough that was also one of the greatest matches of all time it was very tough so doesn't that creep in like that doubt because you don't you don't have enough data to be be confident based on yeah i mean okay if i never have fought before you know suddenly walk into a fight with someone like that then would i be that confident i mean probably no you know so that history of what you know what we've been doing what we've been achieving does gives you confidence if that was my first fight ever i wouldn't probably i wouldn't be that confident but the time off it doesn't matter doesn't matter doesn't matter doesn't matter you don't have the fear or the actual physical experience the psychological experience of being rusty of being out of that will that will come on on training so you okay so you simulate some aspect to that in the training minutes the the training will tell you how you are okay did you increase the intensity of the training leading up to this yeah i mean i train i train normal let's say compared to the first fight the the second was a lot more confidence because you know like i said on training the training for the first fight they were terrible so what what do you mean i think i was focused in mma for a while for a couple months and i wasn't really focused in the gi and you know by this time i accepted the fight and start training like all my responses on training were off like all my training partners that i used to train with that i destroyed i mean now they're like they're beating me you know it's like i cannot beat them the way i i i i was used to mhmm but you know so i i knew something was not right for the first fight but then is is it you know no points is submission or or draw so yeah for people who don't know it was in martin morris which is a twenty minute match submission only so there's no the winner is determined only by submission otherwise it's a draw so physically i wasn't i wasn't myself on that fight i i was tired and my body wasn't responding anyway so that so the confidence was different from the first the second i think i was confident enough that i wouldn't get tapped out on the first that i was still gonna fight because he has to tap me out to beat me and i trust on my defense i'm confident enough for my defense that he will not tap me out but in terms of winning you know walking to the second fight i was a lot more confident what can you say about that feeling when something's not right isn't that a thing that breaks people it's weird breaks it's weird like people crack they give up you know this is a big test because it's like being really tired it's the same thing it's like a lot of people crack because they just feel they cannot give in more they have nothing more to give so they just like give up it's too hard so what do you do just again take the thoughts out there is no giving up i mean i don't mind i don't care like you you just giving up is not an option it's not that's always the way you thought yeah about jiu jitsu yeah like i've never gave up i mean i tapped it's you know not giving up is not tapping that's just stupid especially you know doing training like it's i get caught i tap i've never ever hurt myself by not tapping i get you get angry you know train hard you know improve make a make yourself better you'll get caught accept that you made a mistake give up tap then try harder so you know the not tapping it's you're sacrificing your body and you know you'll never be the same like if you let your elbow popped the elbow will never ever be the same ever yeah you let yourself go to sleep your resistance drops so it's everybody has a has a limit of resistance until they you know to resist a choke before you pass out the moment that you you you you you go to sleep that resistance will drop according to i've never heard anyone say that that's awesome that's true so tap this so that's the reason because people usually say it's you you get it's it's the same or you're getting knocked out you get knocked out the first time your resistant dropped your drop get weak gets weaker so just for the record i've never got to sleep in your hands which means my resistance is high right i don't know must be oh your defeces is pretty good i don't know about that no i would because it doesn't make sense to me or maybe in my case i think my understanding of when i'm screwed is pretty good yeah like there's no you're not in trouble yeah one of the things i regret the most about my jiu jitsu journey is not having given enough time to being in really bad positions like the better i got i think the less i started being in bad positions which is just terrible spar that's like the that is how you train yeah because you used to just spar when you spar like it's difficult to to be in bad positions a lot you train with better people but i mean let's say five six minute rows how long you're gonna be in a really bad position not long right so you don't really have time to develop that's why people they don't you know they don't train in bad position because you have to start there over and over again to be used to it yeah or put yourself there i just didn't have that mindset i think i think you start i mean part of the fun of jiu jitsu is as you get better and better you have certain people you go with you have these puzzles that you figured out that you're playing very specific details you're working out you're trying to improve your main like techniques and so on but yeah just the percentage of time you spend being submitted or being or try even going against like lower ranks trying to escape basic submissions is low i i don't know if that's true for most people probably is right most people have a very bad defense yeah because they don't allow themselves to be there because i mean who wants to get tapped because you will until you you know to work on your defense of course you're gonna get tapped or you know you're not gonna escape you're gonna struggle to escape so people they don't want to be there i regret it most because of the effect it clearly had on how i competed it i it was it was clear that my competition was was constantly driven by conservative thinking like don't take risks i think because of a weak defense honestly and i think a lot of the any of the fear like for example exhaustion was accompanied by fear because of weak defense i think if i were to psychoanalyze myself and i i regretted it i regret it a lot but speaking of which i don't think anyone's ever submitted you in competition so you're well while i was a juvenile yes yes so so when you were a young person yeah sixty that still haunt you no it's first i was winning that fight by a large i mean i think by six points or four something like that but i was like i was done remember it though by the details yeah that's funny yeah you ever beat him again he never competed again whoever you are please let's let's do a podcast now we'll talk shit about hodger the whole thing no but what do you attribute that to you're saying you're confident you're confident that the top of the world the number one would not submit you so where is that confidence grounded and what do you attribute the fact that nobody was able to submit you first you come to training you know i train a lot bad position like my defense is good because i i practice over and over again that as much as i practice all my offensive position so it's you know you have to train both equally it's not just being a good position you have to be in bad so i think that's a very strong part of my game you know i had to to be a complete fighter you know at least a complete martial artist you have to be good in every single position every single one those that you're not you have a weakness so it's you know to be complete you should have no weakness so that was always my you know i was always very particular on that like it's where are my weakness where am i why i don't feel good at it if you put me in a position where i struggle how to escape how to get out everything any submission locked penny position you know back mount everything it's doesn't matter which position i up i practice over and over again so that when i if i get there in a fighting situation i will know how to get out at least i'll have a direction you know i will know this is my way out do you practice both escaping the bad position and always the the transition into the bad position avoiding it because that's how it happens you know jiu jitsu you start in a neutral position no the transition then then becomes the the fight itself it's it's being there is the most important it's when you're there then you have to know how to get out that that's your weakness stopping the person getting that is something different so they're two different things it's you you you either you practice one or the other so but both are important i guess of course but the the stopping a person is easier to practice because that comes naturally in training yeah what was the actual process like what was your biggest weakness throughout your like just remembering what was annoying to you to figure out i mean now sight control is always bottom of sight control bottom it's regardless how much you you you practice it's not ever easy you'll never be easy but it's so annoying it makes no sense yeah someone pins you down he doesn't wanna move much he's a big and strong guy regardless of who it's not gonna be easy to escape so some situations are just hard that must be the sorry to interrupt i'm interrupting haja gracie in discussing but you just made me realize if you're really good if you're you're if you're going against like the perfect jujitsu competitor probably side control might be one of the hardest positions to is it the hardest position to escape it's one of them if the person doesn't wanna progress he just concerned about both of them going yeah like the best pinners in the world i mean partially because i've just seen judo people that know how to pin yeah they go skip this i control it's a nightmare it's a nightmare doesn't matter how much you practice yeah it's a nightmare and it's also just frustrating yeah i think it i guess it is also frustrating because a lot of people in that position will be about maintaining control not progressing yeah and usually people when they're in mount and in back control are usually trying to yeah progress towards the submission which opens up opportunities for escape yeah so what's the actual process of just time and time again putting yourself in psych a bottom side control yeah over and over again starting there escape get back escape get back if you mount you get back any situation outside that stops start again stops start again and it has to be i'll say five minutes because it's the repetition that we teach you you know if you train like three minutes on top you have time to you know one thing and then time up it's the repetition there over and over again you know when you try to say move over and over again then you see what can go wrong and is it understanding the details of the movement or actually doing the movement and feeling it it's it's both first you have to understand the movement and then practice but most important thing is defense escape coming second because you know he's attacking you the one thing is if he's not trying to submit you but the other one if he is let's say if it's a person who's very good has a very good attack the first thing is defense not just escape you can expose yourself to a even worse position because that is very risky when you're trying to escape you'll always expose yourself to a worse position so avoiding that it's you know first is defense not getting caught and then when you're escaping don't be in a worse position so defense in jiu jitsu when you're wearing a gi what does defense in entail is it mostly grips is it mostly the positioning of your hips and legs it's it's it's it's everything together because it's a whole body movement constantly moving your your arms legs body it's it they they you know they they have to everything works together going back to the mind of that guy going back to the mind of that guy so confident no fear at this point is there a bit of ego in there too yes like like i say you know i'm not gonna say i'm fear i'm fearless of course these concerns that fight i would have to say was probably the fight that i got nervous the most walking in because i knew what that meant that fight i mean everything for me all my legacy was on the line because if i lost that fight i would forever be number two yeah forever and i mean boucheshe is is a great great guy great competitor julius is very good but i'm better than him i knew that but he's competing nonstop at that point he's a great competitor you know taking nothing out of him he's super tough very very tough very good he's probably the best competitor in jujitsu he won thirteen times the world championship i won ten so as a competitor you know he has more titles than i do so but in terms of you know analyzing the game i consider technically better than him so knowing all that everything that i build all my legacy it's if i lose riding on this match if i lose this fight i'm forever number two and none of that is going going through your mind i know i knew i mean it's not at that moment that i i already knew that i remember just before you know the the curtains open i'm standing in before they call my name and i mean my legs were like shit i feel the adrenaline kick in on my legs and i'm like you know i'm hitting the legs i'm like wake up you know yeah get off get the adrenaline off me you know so it's it was it was intense it was intense and this was in rio that was in rio so my hometown so this is i mean and you know rio is is not exactly known for its calmness in its fans so this is like wherever they hosted the olympics the year before yeah so this is like i mean this like the whole basically martial arts community is watching this a step fight yeah i mean is there some was hansel there yeah yeah he was there so people are just i mean there's a tension and it's also i mean i don't know if you felt that in part but you're also fighting for the gracie name yeah in the in our hometown the greatest where the gracie really stacks competitor of all time arguably in the hometown yeah i mean okay all my family my best friends my friends everybody watching everybody there there was a lot of pressure a lot so and then were you thinking that you would be able to submit him no it's at that point like i don't predict how the fight will go that i never did because it is unpredictable it's i never tried to set any strategy for any fight i think oh okay that i did but that was the only time that i set any strategy into a fight there was a fifteen minutes fight then and for i said first five minutes i'm gonna play defense he's bigger stronger younger i don't wanna play his game and i know he comes in very fast every single fight he had you know he comes very aggressive so my strategy walk into the fight i say five minutes i'm gonna play defense i'm not gonna try to attack i'm not gonna try to match his pace i already expected you know maybe i'm gonna start losing the fight because you know if he comes in there's a risk of me maybe getting take down or you know something happened i'm like i'm gonna stick to the game plan five minutes i'm gonna stop picking up the pace because then it's ten minutes to go which ten minutes a long fight so i don't need to stop fast but i'm gonna stop being more aggressive and then you know try to take him down or pull guard you know but by then i'm like that's as far as strategy goes so no specific stay on the feet were you comfortable being both bottom and top in this yeah strategic i'm i'm always comfortable being bottom top i prefer to be on top because being in the bottom the person on top dictates the pace of the fight because he's on top over you so i always prefer to be on top because i can dictate the pace i can implement my own pace and being the bottom they can slow me down so it's harder so if i can choose i will always be on top but i think by then i was like it's you know five minutes hit it i'm like he's pretty big and strong i'm gonna spend a lot of energy taking him down i forgot how did it how did it feel so here you're stepping in by the way puzzle mats this is old school as old school as it gets so calm and relaxed here for people just listening we're watching the early minutes of the match yeah so just feeling it out he seems pretty calm too he must be nervous too i i wonder how do you ever talk to him you guys are friends yeah yeah we're friends did he ever say how nervous he was no we never spoke about that fight no no he probably lays late at night thinking about it maybe i don't know that sob yeah i mean so you'll see the first five minutes no he kept i knew what he was going to do in my study his game his stand up is most basic is basic in takedowns leg attacks double legs so he goes single double and he charges in that is pretty much his stand up game so you would try you get you get a grip yeah that but we got penalized so do you like to use the do you like to post with your left you have a right foot forward usually you're a righty right i'm a righty but i know he wants my leg so i'm i'm i'm playing my stance just because of his game oh you know all my grips are that the first five minutes was to kinda try to neutralize his attacks so he wants to get your left leg yeah yeah right there yeah so how hard is that to stop that i mean he felt pretty strong coming in so i'm you know pushing the head down trying to play with his balance yeah wow if if you if you see it there was a pause go back there he charged in there's a pause me standing in front of him yeah i did that on purpose what do you mean just to just to make fun of him because you know he tried yeah and i'm like you fail i'm here there's a okay so you could feel the frustration i could feel his frustration his frustration not be able to take me down okay so now and this is just psychological battles and you see me walking straight into the middle of the mat and he's circling out yeah see i'm going very slow i'm recovering and he's computing like shit yeah okay because he just made a you know effort tried to take me down he needs to recover and i mean you you need to recover the other guys they are waiting for you yeah and do i tie do i go for another takedown because this one failed no do i need to recalculate the strategy yeah and he kept trying over and over again and keep failing i think that frustrate him a lot on that fight i felt i felt him kinda slowing down because he was getting nowhere so we're five minutes in yeah he keeps so he never got that takedown in the in the early no let's see so at this point do you pull guard yeah okay so that's when i felt like he's he's mentally he's he's not he's worried now did you try to pull close guard here no i knew he's gonna bring danny in okay because that's the defense against pulling close guard yeah but i like that what do you i like people bringing the knee between my legs because see i'm gonna close my guard even with his legging okay he is he's he's stopping the well this is this is awkward but because i i was holding his arm that's why he felt he had no no hand to post got it but still it puts a leg in yeah but you're able to close your guard around you're okay with that i i do that really well i sweep people from that position a lot what's the sweep i guess just just pushed okay he's just a like to your left side yeah okay because he has no oh it's almost like you mean you're basically around his back a little bit yeah like he he knew that like i swept a lot of people with that sweep so you you see he kept leaning to his left to my right yeah so i wanna push them to my left so you see him leaning over to my right a lot what's the right answer for him to like roll or something no i mean he's stuck he does not really he's stuck there correct but the one thing he did he kept off me completely see that he's leaning too like he's too afraid of my attack now yep because he that you know he should lean on me yep you know you you should bring the fight to me so when i fell him you know i i i knew he was like he's too worried about my attacks now oh yeah that's right so he can't yeah if he goes back to the center he has no like so he's not engaging at that time he's a hundred percent just defending so i failed that i'm like he's he doesn't wanna engage and he's looking i knew at that point he wants my foot because our first fight i had this like the same position i wasn't holding his arm and he went to attack my foot mhmm which he did you know he got into like a toe hold or what okay yeah so i know he's looking at my foot which foot sorry the left your right foot yeah my right yeah my right foot okay and so i'm holding his arm i'm holding his arm and now you're going to the back as an arm drag type of thing so the moment that i came off now i'm here i'm holding his arm so he cannot come up so you know i'm holding his left arm so he cannot post a hand on the floor and come up and he's holding your right to try to get you yep basically to prevent you from attacking yeah oh that's interesting and he rolls yeah he tried to he tried to get me off balance so see now i'm switching i switched the grip on his arm so i can free my left arm can i ask you a question like was there a chance he sweeps you here i mean there's always a chance but very that yeah but see my left arm is free oh so you can post yeah why is your left arm free oh because you're using it too got it got it okay now i tried the hook now you will see still got your own when when yeah but when i knew he's he's panicking because he did a move that he completely opened himself up like i'm holding his left arm so by holding the arm his that prevents him from defending the hook on that side because his arm is being hold across so the arm cannot block the hook and i mean that that the duck hook with your left leg yeah so you'll see when he come up but i would say i mean that's my guess but bushesh is he's he's a big guy you know he's like a hundred and ten kilos a hundred and twelve something like that which is two forty five yeah alright yep so what were you at the time less two twenty yeah two twenty a nice twenty two maybe slim one hundred kilo okay yeah so you know his his defense are not amazing he's good but you know he's not known to have amazing defense so he by being the big guy in the room when you train you wish to get out of situation because of your size you shake people off you know it's it's because of your size you shake them off you get off some bad positions you can i mean i could feel on the first fight i'm side control you know suddenly he explode out so you know you i've i've seen him doing that a few of his fights no not in the most technical way just getting out and he did because of his size so and he did the same thing like he tried to stood up when i'm on his back he completely opened up the hooks he will see the next move his head gonna come up and he gonna try to get off the floor so basically come up shake you off kind of strategy and there was no difference for the hooks i put both hooks in straight away his arm is yeah i'm i'm off balance yeah see the i didn't bring him up he came up yeah and now i'm attacking his neck and he's worried about the hooks that's fatal mistake that's like defense always come first remember what i just said now yeah defense first cape second so he's not worried more about the points than his neck so it was like a a a progression of mistakes that's why i think he got frustrated when he couldn't take me down yeah and then when i pulled guard he was frustrated that the fight wasn't going his way you know he's he's very good about taking down he try over and over again for five minutes and here he was frustrated about the hooks so he's like it's almost like the frustration things like no no no these hooks shouldn't be here like i pull guard on the grips no no no these hooks shouldn't be here like i pull guard on the grips that i want he's not comfortable inside my guard he's not in a position that he wants to be he's over leaning to his left you know to to to to not he's not engaging or trying to pass mhmm he's trying to get the foot but his army is trapped he's gonna get nowhere and then when i swept him some of his words start collapsing you know he couldn't take me down i pulled out i'm swept in he tried to roll me over no didn't get me anywhere the first movement that he tried to escape i'm on his back i mean not his legs yeah that if you just go back to him standing up see both hook goes in no difference like there was nothing on the way of those hooks because he tried to come up coming up you're you're high enough on him to where the weight was just probably immense it just felt too heavy i mean you gotta you you already got you already you already going for the choke man of course there's no time to lose look at that yeah so you're not like worried i'm gonna get shaken off you're going for the trip okay you got your right hand on the shaking you off i'm on your back now we're in this together and your your right hand is opening up the lapel my right hand is holding his arm i still holding the sleeve sorry like you're holding the sleeve but i'm holding the sleeve and i'm already going for the neck because it's timing at which point do you let go of the sleeve and open up help with the power or do you not need it no i i did that but first i wanna try to make a grip like then i need to establish control before i let go of his arm got it so i kept holding that a bit longer and then when i fell okay i have a good control over the back then i let go do you okay so you have like a light grip on his lapel but you're thinking you need that need to adjust that you need to adjust that yeah you're like holding it there and you're thinking okay at some point i need to adjust it all all i need all i want is to get under his chin then i know it's it's it's i mean it's now i can go for it because if it's over there's no joke right i need the wrist needs to be on there can you joke bouchero over the no i can't that's just not right okay anyway it's not right or it doesn't work it they're both it's not right and doesn't work i mean would you tap to choke on your chin no just pressure i've you you hurt but it's not gonna choke you out i don't know i don't know i'm not let me argue this i love this argue with hodge your grace about jokes this is great okay like clock joke it's it was always interesting to me because in judo it's illegal to have the gear on the face and so it was kinda liberating for me to be allowed to have a gear on the face no it's just liberating no then you don't have to worry about it like yeah of course it's more effective to go under the chin but i'm surprised just because the amount of pressure like it's all about how much you can take it you can take a lot but it feels like no it doesn't feel comfortable i mean sometimes on your mouth it cuts your mouth now you're bleeding it feels horrible but it feel that's not the feeling the feeling it might not be a joke but the feeling like like it's a pressure that everything's just closing in but but it doesn't take you anywhere like you're not gonna go to sleep you might not go to sleep so it's just pressure yeah so pressure it hurts it's uncomfortable but it it it's not gonna break your face and it's not gonna put you to sleep so if i don't get the neck i don't go for the kill okay i'm like i'm i'm holding the the the his collar mhmm you know my my wrist is almost under it's you know i i'm i'm trying to kinda dig in if if i can't dig in then i will adjust the call but first i need to dig in dig in first and adjust but can you do all that with one hand or no i did so you can tighten the choke with just one hand no i i need the second one to open the lapel to open the lapel yeah but you're like digging in with one knee i'm digging in under the chin under the chin under is under now i need to go deeper but that the going deeper requires a second hand it does okay it does and but that requires you letting go of the other hand yeah i have to let go eventually yeah see alright yeah well that's over yeah because i'm already under his like the first hand got on the dead chin mhmm do you need the hand on the second lapel yeah of course otherwise he turns and he's out that's to control the turning versus the tightening of the choke yeah it does both it it helps tighten the collar and stop the person rolling out were you feeling pretty good about this position yes i just felt it's getting tighter tighter tighter tighter because he wasn't super tight from the beginning he wasn't like the perfect choke so we're still i mean i knew it was like it's very close to the end but you know i still need to adjust there's still the risk of maybe escaping is it possible for his head to slip up if possible yes but i'm closing that gap yeah and here what what did that feel like relief relief like awesome amazing somebody on reddit asked asked him about the cross grip he used to sweep followed with the genius grips which when buchesha was inverted did you use a cross grip when you sweep did you i guess the cross grip in the arm that must be it oh that's the cross grip okay what's the genius behind that or was that just the do you like that kind of that kind of grip yeah because i always like closed guard and no one wants to be in anyone's closed guard right it's open guard is the step to pass so everybody when you try to close the guard they bring the knee in with the in the middle like if you if if you're not standing if you're lower on the ground and the open guard if you're close to me you need that knee between so it's a must that's when i start developing the attack you know i i manage to have long legs to close my legs around people even with that and then i just develop that sweep when did you start developing that like i don't remember when but i would say before black belt okay so your answer to that is not to figure out how to prevent them from putting the knee in is there an answer to that no but good guys will always no you can't try and get the knee in remove the leg out of the way that's not possible well maybe off balance them enough to where there's not no okay i mean it you you can try but like it's it's hard if you're just gonna off balance then you'll sweep them right so that means gonna so you're gonna have to settle for sleep yeah because that's is extremely common to have that i mean if i'm on your guard open guard you know if you have your legs if i'm between both of your legs and the open guard my knee will be between your legs because it's a must my knee cannot be on the floor since hanzo was there what did he tell you before i think just motivate you i think that hanzo always did that fantastically well to motivate me like before i fight a match i think that you know the confidence you know his you know his energy being around you it's i think that's the is is is the great thing to have hands on your corner it's the motivation that he gives you what did you learn about jiu jitsu and life from hensel gracie we got to hang out with him in in vegas a little bit he's a character yeah he's one of the historic coaches and jujitsu competitors but also personalities in the martial arts world yeah in in the world in general there's very few like him hans is a fantastic person it's it's you know what what i've learned most from him is like it's you know you can take any challenge it's you know doesn't matter when and where you know who it's you know you have to be ready and you know with that worst spirit that he has he's you know he always took any challenge ready or not ready was it you that said it or he said it where not until you go in you know to do something difficult do you discover the strength that you have so like like if you really think about it you might think that you don't you're not good enough you don't have the strength to take on something difficult i fully agree i think we are measure not when we're on the strongest but when we are on the weakest that's when we truly measure ourselves or character who we are not we're in a position of power or we're in a position of weakness have you surprised yourself like how damn good you are like is this is this really how good i am in this situation where in retrospect you might think how the hell was i able to accomplish this not how good i am because otherwise i wouldn't be there so you know being there in the first place it's it's already not a great thing but i say you know i've every single time i found myself there i was super proud that i've never cracked like i've never gave up ever any second any fight never never been broken in competition never even it's it's not about winning or losing it's about you giving up i've never doubt myself i always fought to the very end always that i'm most proud of because there was moments you know it's you're in a terrible position you know mainly like there was moments that i was super tired but like exhaustive tired when it was easy to give up like i had nothing more to give but i pushed i took energy out of my soul i would have to say because when my body had zero my my you know my spirit my soul pull it out is that in part just not allowing yourself to have to have to ever ever quit yeah i have one other thing i regret i remember like a blue belt match i remember i'm not gonna say who it was against but i remember just being extremely exhausted and just constantly fighting a guy was really good mount really good guard passing and i just remember him passing my guard eventually so it's just like a finals of one of the ibjjf tournaments and then right away going to mount and just i don't know i the the level of frustration i mean i quit at that point so i remember that still like i it's not about losing winning or losing but i just remember i i was like like i was like teary eyed frustrated and then i knew there was a lot of fights still left even in there somewhere and i i i quit and i regret that to this day yeah because i think the reason i regret that is because it gave me an option to to now quit in every other aspect of life like that this is an option yeah it is it sucks yeah it teaches you you know it makes us stronger it's like to say made you stronger yeah it makes you stronger that you did that to learn that don't do that again but still like you said just going to sleep in training i do think it made me weaker it did make me weaker in the rest of my life too the those you know i've quit a few times in my life on small things and you realize okay it's not that big of a deal it's fine like who cares but that what you learn over time is that voice always comes there like obviously maybe it does for you too at the even at the highest level of like it's not that big of a deal like it's okay to quit here like it makes sense everybody would understand you know in some sense like you're you know many people would say you're past your prime in this match with the like it makes sense you've been focusing on mma makes sense yeah makes sense to lose yeah i don't know that that's a weird voice and in some sense it's that voice and a voice that says like why are you doing this like this is silly this make any sense just stop just stop just stop yeah and shutting that voice down and never allowing yourself to quit that's a really powerful thing like everybody i've met everybody that's successful yeah down to the the even engineers ceos elon musk just never quitting like when everybody around you it says quit never quitting it's weird i don't know what that is might be genetic it it might be like using the stubbornness to just never allow yourself to develop that it's basically developing a calluses to that voice that tries to tell you to quit you never quit what would you attribute that to it's like how much you want to get to the destination you chose like you know it's how bad you wanna get there it's if you quit you're never gonna get there and you always wanted to i always wanted to is there some thing you remember from that match some things that happened before and after that stand out to you just since in rio yeah there was an interview you know like prior to the fight you know there was a big fight we were doing like media every day before we you know me and him we were meeting for media and like five days before you know five six days before i'm quite chatty it's you know the closer we get to the fight the more focused i get the less i talk stop joke around playing you know with people but i remember i think it was maybe three or four days before we were doing an interview together i think my cousin kira was there she was doing one of the interviews with us and i don't remember exactly what we were talking about but i just remember we're talking about the fight of course and then it was you know we're standing beside each other and i'm like and then i you know suddenly i chop and i grab him by the neck mhmm i say well i'm gonna tap you by the neck and then he's like you know very shy yeah and then i let go and see no i'm gonna grab tap you by the arm and i could feel he was like he wasn't comf comfortable you know with being there it was you know me saying that i'm gonna tap him out there was like i was so relaxed joking about it but i'm joking that i'm gonna tap him out in a fight that we're gonna have him for a days' time and yeah i felt he was like not comfortable at all do you think you got in his head a little bit i did to give you a little bit of confidence yeah you said that jiu jitsu is a reflection of your personality so both your jiu jitsu and your personality there's a calmness what is that why are you so calm is there in like an ocean underneath that's boiling is this developed or is this your personality are you basically leveraging who you are already to to develop a game around the jiu jitsu or did did jiu jitsu make you calm i think both i i was always very calm since i was a kid you know since very young i was never very you know fiery person so that is a reflection you know you reflected on my duties of my life on my fights where i fight so it's a direct influence of my personality and i think it's also in the day you know you develop the more the more you practice you know the more you fight it's like you know you don't want to get nervous you don't want the adrenaline in so you just learn how to shut that off from your mind so the less i thought about it you know it's like how many times i fought you know let's say the week before the fight that's when you start more when you're concerned the most because now it's getting very close before it's just far away you know it's normal to think of the tournament you get a bit nervous but it goes away quick but the fight you know the week before now you're constantly thinking of that day and every time you think adrenaline pumps in your heart accelerate you know it doesn't you know it makes it it's like why am i feeling this what different will it make so you kinda you're sharing that thought out of your mind because you don't wanna feel the adrenaline your heart accelerating it's not gonna add you anything so it's you know it's the practice also that i think it helped me to shut that off my mind has that helped you in regular life yeah of course it's you know with somebody when you go into any any situation that might be stressful you know like an important meeting no super whatever it is it's like how much would you worry about that before worried is not gonna help you anywhere it's the opposite just gonna make you more nervous your heart accelerate your ability to think clearly is gonna be damaged by that so it's like the more calm the more relaxed you are the better you can think of do you ever get angry yeah like in traffic do you ever do you ever get like not calm just like you're screaming no it's not in a screaming it's no but just angry but the the what does the angry look like is it still calm yeah like you know a few seconds of complaining but then it goes away have you ever like thrown a cell phone at a wall or something like that i think it's just that no i never get that because that's just silly it's like it's it's it's if if i would have done that i would not be able to control my emotions prior to fight that would be a loss of reflection yeah letting yourself lose yeah losing control that that will reflect other times do you think it has make you in part made you more emotionally closed off from the world like you're you're it's harder for you to be vulnerable to others probably yeah but i i heard that a few times i'm emotionally close mhmm it's yeah maybe that i think that influenced it yeah have you ever cried in a movie yeah for not for many years but for that i think maybe i'm getting older do you remember the movie something that's basically a movie i mean it's no i mean out the notebook no i mean i would say the last few years i've been crying more than before for some reason i don't know why like silly movies like nothing suddenly brings tears to my eyes yeah yeah well i've already i've already just having met you and interacted with you i can see that you're kind of opening your heart and mind to the world you could you could see like here's this historically great athlete now like the wars have been fought and you're now like waking up to the world it's it's cool to see probably i'm bringing my guard down now i don't have to get it up all the time that's a that's a fight you can even do some podcasts you said you watched like movies beforehand sometimes you mentioned braveheart what were you doing did you watch something beforehand like the day before i used to yeah i there was like i think braveheart and gladiator i mean there's a few others that i've always watched the day before because the day before i used to do nothing i just wanna be at home in bed watching tv like saving you know energy stretching by myself so it's like it's i just wanna save energy i don't wanna waste my energy going out going around so you know those are the movies that i always like to watch kinda try to bring some you know hyper excitement it's like you know i'm getting ready to watch tomorrow so i'm like let me watch some movies that like brought there you know some that were spirit yeah into me yeah what is that about human nature braveheart i love yeah even more should you put your life on the line for a thing that matters or run away just so you can live it's like running you may live but like years from now when you look back at this moment would you trade all the days yeah just to come back and to this moment and tell the english you could take our lives but you can't take our freedom i mean oh man what is that about human nature is there some aspect of like the glory you were able to achieve being more important than anything else there's some aspect of that that that's that's greatness you know yeah i never pursued glory so it's it just came you know it is it it came with it but that was never my goal i never care for glory were you able to experience like like i'm at the height of this thing whatever whatever humanity is able to achieve in various things holy shit i'm flying i fell like i'm i'm i'm no one can touch me i can destroy people yeah prolonged periods of time or just momentarily i always knew you know from before i got to a black belt like i can be great because i used to train with the best in the world i used to you know for many years and i used to see my progression with then everybody else so i i knew i was getting somewhere i knew i could be the best and that was that was always my goal since very very young and i always believed that i could be and that over the years that kept telling me over and over again because i'm getting better and better faster than everybody else so it's i just need to carry on with what i'm doing but i think you've said that you wanted to and maybe you thought you could be the greatest of all time like at the very beginning like when you sucked yeah yeah not not the greatest of all time because and i never really thought about that but i thought i'm gonna be the best in the world when i start when i start okay so what is that what is that like that self belief is there a component to that self belief being a prerequisite it's it's difficult to say because that was a decision i think like why did i believe that i could be i i can't tell you that because i don't know but you think you decided to be i decided to be i decided to be and i believed i could i think there was like a day somewhere when you were young where you're like you're sitting at a college eating cheetos i don't think it was a day like a moment because for many years is i wasn't really training much as a child you know i've done a bit of i used to train and then stop done a bit of judo never stay away away from it much but until you know like from ten to fourteen i barely trained jujitsu much i used to there was no gracie school near where i used to live and i was doing there was a jujitsu judo school i used to go twice a week i went to a jiu jitsu tournament i lost in five seconds left crying the guy he pawned me in five seconds anyway so when i was fourteen i went to the south of brazil to see my uncle helene to spend such summer holidays i was there for like four weeks i think and i when i got there my cousin hollis were living with him hollis like bigger than me it was i think four years four years older so i was fourteen i was already eighteen seventeen eighteen purple belt competitor and i think that was the first time in my life that i felt what it mean what it meant to be a gracie in terms of having a school teaching training you know living that you know jujitsu lifestyle what a great city mean to be and i've just i've loved it it was out of shape my uncle was like you know incentivizing me to lose weight to train but you're not training why you know it's like you've got a shape you need to diet so i used i used to run every day i was eating super well i start you know i start that's when i start changing so when i go back to rio i was super motivated to follow-up carry on and he invited me to go back there to live with him but i couldn't it was too soon to change schools and everything my mom said no but maybe next year if you wanna go you can so i kept that in my mind next year i moved to the south to live with him i was fifteen and it was him my uncle helen and my uncle they both used to live very close to each other they used to have their own schools close to each other so i was with both and i stayed there for almost a year i mean i was the youngest in the academy there was some you know blue purple bears normal guy but they're very competing training ahead of me and i just joined the group of training i didn't compete while i was there because there was no competition that then and i wasn't really ready but it's not about competing it's more about the training and i start training every day start improving and year after that when i came back to rio i was already on a mission i was like i love this i'm just carry on training every day with my uncle carlos carlos gracie junior gracie barra and when i got there i was training a little bit there before but i just fourteen fifteen but when i got there there was a you know there was one of that was one of the most competitor one of the biggest jujitsu school at the time there were so many high level world champions competitors in every single belt and so and i've kinda joined in with that and i've carried on i don't remember when but i remember you know looking and saying i'm gonna be the best in the world but i used to be i was at the bottom of the stairs you know no one really believed me i didn't shout you know to to disguise but you know i told a few people i'm like i'm gonna be the best and that's i think i was just losing but i've never ever doubt i've never divert from that mission i would say did anyone believe you when you said you could be great nobody did it matter didn't matter i don't care i don't need even people that like love you everybody my mom my dad not me no one thought no one in my family thought i was gonna be here today nobody because i just started late you know i've i've never had any start that people oh that kid's gonna be really good yeah oh i'm i'm always a chubby kid that didn't barely train i mean people used to look at me he's just another great see this you know one more what do you learn from that do you think most people lose that self belief they quit when when everyone around them doesn't believe yeah i think if if those that need approval yes i see you shouldn't have approval i never need approval from anyone i don't care if you if you're leaving or not if you're not my problem it's tough it's tough i don't need approval but you're surrounded by people older wiser better than you and they're kinda directly or indirectly saying you stop being silly kid no no one ever told me that because i i it's not that was not something that i used to say all the time i maybe say it just very very few times i just want you know maybe that's the secret it's the of course i mean if you start shouting then you're just being silly then it's not what would you really want then you're saying that for another reasons if you say it over and over again because you shouldn't i mean that's why well to push back one of the reasons you might want to say it is to find the right people that believe in you yeah but no if you say over and over again then it's just then you're just bragging sure because one thing is to say it but the other one is to do it yeah so it's you know you said it once or very few times but now we have to do it saying it's not helping you get in there was there sacrifices you had to make everything everything that was my priority in life everything was secondary like social life yeah career paths yeah all everything and as from fourteen fifteen sixteen as you get better and better and better and better it was just becoming sharper the focus on this thing yeah it's just over and over again over and over again it's you know it's just training training training and i mean how many times i lost i i have i have no clue so on the mat you were getting beat up i'm getting smashed by everybody people my age i was chubby i was physically weak i mean i'm tall but physically i'm not physically strong i'm normally strong for my size but physically if you wanna measure strength i'm weak because you know we can measure strength living with lifting weights i'm weak i don't lift i lift weight same as people much lighter than me everybody my my weight lifts heavy weight and then people that train with you often talk about how strong- they're super strong yeah because i generate a lot of strength i can create i i i put myself in the right angles so then i can be strong i'm not strong and the only person who i listened to saying that is computer one guy that i fought rodrigo medeiros mhmm i fought him a few times and he's the only one that i heard saying about me that's like no roger is not strong he's not he's technical and he's he can create strength but he's not strong he meant that as a compliment yeah i think so no it's i think he was honest because yeah he i think he's the only one who could see that yes so i think that's a compliment so he's technically really strong so you had incredible matches with him yeah is there insight you have about how you went from a person who is not very good but had a a dream a confident dream a vision to somebody that was actually good was there something to the practice sessions were you getting reps on a specific techniques i'd never done anything special because i mean you know i'm in a gym training equally with everybody else so i've never did anything on the side different than anybody else so you know i i was in the school training the exact the same way as everybody else well in terms of schedule yes but what was can you reverse engineer what what was going through your mind because there's so many different ways to actually mentally approach the same exact training session i'm gonna try to beat you okay so it's in some part it's competitive yeah like at the core of it is i want to be better than these particular people you're gonna keep beating me i'm gonna keep coming back are you and to do that i have to solve problems i have to figure out how to do stuff well you catch me once i'm gonna keep on coming trying to not get get get caught on that at which point did you develop a game that was basically the white the famous white belt game of the very basics the very fundamentals of jiu jitsu like saying i'm going to beat you never i'm there was never there was never a conscious decision to try to you know to have a basic jujitsu first i think there's a big misconception there okay major juice is not basic major juice is not basic it's not you're right it's not basic it's not old school i think people they just don't see that it's extremely complex in in a way that is is is people they cannot copy i teach people you know i can teach you the cross color choke but the one thing that people they don't realize is not the move is you need to practice the move until you learn it's the practice over and over again like it took me years when i say years i'm like years after i was a black belt i was able to choke people out with a cross collar choking them out effectively years after i got my black belt so that's something that you learn first day first week so i can teach you it it makes no difference you you know the theory but until you apply it i mean it will help you of course the more details you learn you know the the the more tools you have to practice but it's still very complex because it's not about the move itself it's about how can you control the movement of the other person he's resisting you're blocking you cannot predict what he would do and he's doing a whole bunch of moves to to block you every single move you do a step of the way because it's a it's it's a progression of move from beginning to end till i apply the choke it's a progression of move and there's not one way to get that there's many ways because how many ways can you blocked you can put your arm in every single angle we have both arms you can bridge so it's dealing with all that that is the that is the complex complexity of that position but that goes for everything like every single move my strong moves i would say it took me years developing them years so it's and you're gonna tell me that's basic so go try and do it what the other person is defending that's the thing because most of the things that i do i've been doing them for years and i they know that i'm gonna do and i can still get it most of the times that's the hardest it's when they know what's coming and you can still do it and you you said that the way you're able to do that you just have to do it right yeah what do you learn by doing all the steps along the way and just for people who don't know cross collar choke from the mount so just to start in a neutral place there's people on their feet and then you either then you get to the ground somehow and then there's the person on top and on bottom and then there's a guard with the legs between the two people and then you can get past the guard as you get past the guard and you into side control and so on you get more and more and more dominant positions and so mount is considered to be one of the most dominant positions it's when you're past their legs sitting on top of their stomach putting pressure on them and cross collar choke is using their jacket to how would you explain that to to choke the callers i put my both hands on your callers and when i squeeze it it you you press your neck it blocks the venue you go to sleep so it's you you choke people with your hands in the wrist you put them you know you grab the collar so you get the wrist around people's neck and you squeeze yep the discovery of that is fascinating i mean because it's it's it's interesting it's like you know you can imagine there's all kinds of ways to choke a human being what animals do it with their like mouth right they put like their jaws around the and the fact that you can kind of discover this methodology of the right kind of positioning and then it becomes an art form like of why this why not this right or why not this or something like to figure out that we we practice that will come easy over time you figure out what works and what not on you and then yeah and then more further and further details and subtleties start to emerge anyway on that process of beating of being able to beat some of the best people in the world and the thing they know is coming what did what's the difference in the white belt doing that and hydra grace doing that the thing that's so hard to explain what do you think you're picking up is it some tiny tiny details of muscle movements it is it's many tiny details because it is is the whole movement itself it's the perception from beginning to end like every step of the movement it's important and precise so it's you know you miss one one detail on the way you collapse so when i say that with the black belt the black belt has no control over the whole movement he's thinking beginning and end so he goes straight to your you know straight to your neck regardless he cannot read the other person if it's you know if it's time to let go if it's time to go for a neck should i be pushing here before i get my hand in you know is is is this the right time to go deep or should i deal deal with this first before the second hand that's at the beginning so it's at that the white belt yeah at the very beginning of the journey yeah the white belt you just think finish yeah and then as you get progress you see that there's like this giant tree of possibilities that you're almost feeling your way down i mean would you be able to teach do you even know what you're doing by the details okay but it's hard to convert into words probably no it's possible then you don't know what you're doing okay so what is what what are some most important details that you could say maybe positioning of the hand the gripping is it the positioning of your body the posture is there some interesting like insights it's it's a it's a it's a combination because first you have to put your body in a very strong position that you don't require your hands to hold them out so the choke is the test first because it i cannot use i cannot use my hands on the floor to stop escaping yeah so if i had to my body has to handle that the way i position myself i have to do it in a way that don't require my hands for balance okay why is the mouse at your dominant position doesn't make any sense right like you're just sitting on top of the stomach of a person it makes all sense if you think what's forget forget fighting forget jiu jitsu like you've never trained what's the one position the most dominant position you can get over another human being one the most for you what which one it is like the most dominant position that you can get over another human being so if we were just because the way i think about it is putting myself in like a six seven eight year old self without knowing any martial arts and i had an older brother who beat the shit out of me yeah it probably was mount it it was but well yes okay so we both didn't know but if we knew something it'd probably be back control if in the back control you're under the other person the thing being under is the most dominant position it can be over another person you mean like a back control if i'm on your back oh like that you can move you can roll i cannot stop you rolling yeah maybe you can even stand up how dominant is that yeah but if we're the same size both untrained if no doesn't matter have you seen kids do they do that okay mal looks and feels like dominance when your two eight year old's fighting okay i don't know i don't know why it feels that way it could be some animalistic thing maybe it is actual dominance i don't know but it feels like if you're untrained you can just buck your way out of it it feels unstable it feels unstable to hold now unless you know what you're doing right no no well if you if you're not to put both of your hands on the floor yeah just just your hands do you think it's easy to take somebody off yeah maybe not do you think it's easy to remove the hand and bring them out the hand's on the floor arms straight i'm leaning and yeah you're right i mean you don't need to know fighting to hold yourself there yeah but you're right when you take the arms off and balancing then it gets tricky because when you're trying to i think what happens i'm thinking back to eight year old because my my brother's five years older than me and he would do the usual like stop hitting yourself thing and he i think he would be in mount like hitting me with my own hands from at a place of love of course i love him deeply and it was very formative and positive experience for me okay i think yeah the weakness is when he takes when the person who has the amount takes their arms off to to do something but even if you keep your hands up in the air when i'm falling yeah you can when i'm falling so speaking about untrained people i feel like they get greedy they try to do stuff the other day i watched my nine year old daughter yeah well we're in a friend's house there's a whole bunch of kids there they're playing and when i looked she's mounting a boy her age her size he cannot escape wow she probably has seen no she trained she's been training for i'll say a year and a half okay she's not much i mean she's a nine year old daughter a girl over a boy has she seen footage of you maybe she picked up no but she she been training for a year and a half so she has an idea what amount is but i mean it talks about skills i don't ever taught her the amount yeah she has you know she had lessons at the academy like any other kid did she make him cry or no but he couldn't escape which which other position would she be able to hold the boy in the in the back he would roll her out that's true like he couldn't come out from underneath as you see decades like there is no other most dominant position that you can pin the other person couldn't you argue from that perspective sight control no no because sight control you have to to hold the other person and it's you're not free you you you cannot release them but in side control your hips are not on top of theirs so they can't buck you off right could could you if you're holding them a little bit and they get hit with one hand but slap his head is here you're gonna hurt him here by the time you're doing that but then he has his arms free and if you turn towards your legs then he's away from your arms you know even has a perfect angle i mean it it is a good position you can hit you can dominate but it's not the best position to be over the other person he can knee you in the head at the same time you punch him then there's a knee coming to your head i love playing devil's advocate with hydra grace about two eight year olds fighting you and you your head is closer to his hand yeah maybe he can give throw you a punch alright so would you would you choose to be in side control over a mouth getting in the head well for a person who in competition prefers knee on belly over a mouth but that's my weakness that's my failure as a human being holding mount is is can be tricky it's very hard of course it's hard but what is easy tell me easy controlling knee on belly is easier but to some extent belly is easy easier i'm not saying black belt level i'm saying well maybe even black belt level these are for what to hold somebody to make them squirm and hurt to create openings ever go to death with a big guy yeah you can't you can't yeah he's gonna push you back and come up in the mount he can't sit up not when he mounted him the thing is also about mount is people on the bottom of mount panic more so they fight harder panic they they they expose yeah it's the most exposure you you have because the post arms are free you cannot touch him his head is too high there's nothing he can do his legs won't get you anywhere i touch your lower back it's like nothing you you you you you most exposed being in the mouth i rather you hold me side control a thousand times the amount of me having to look up for your face come down yeah side control i hug you you cannot hurt me mhmm okay hold me but i'm hugging you if i hug hug you tight what can you do against me hold it it seems maybe it's just from and again i'm arguing just for the fun of it yeah but it seems like a more difficult skill to learn to apply a huge amount of pressure and weight from out you don't have to apply pressure and weight from out not apply pressure but be heavy right you don't necessarily need to be heavy you don't no why do you as people say you feel extremely heavy if i'm putting if i'm being heavy i cannot attack i it's i yeah i have to choose i can be heavy just to penalize you know just to pin them take the energy out you know to make them suffer yeah but the moment that i decide to attack i can only be heavy if i'm sitting up straight that's when my all my weight can drops down if i'm high then i'm sitting on your chest and on your on your on your solar plexus that's the worst position to be seated at on the person because that's where he breathe mhmm so you're in a high mouth sitting up straight that's when you can i can be very heavy i can make people feel my weight and be very uncomfortable but i'm not in a position to attack the moment that i wanna attack my body has to lean forward i have to approach the you know the the neck or the arms the moment that i do that my weight comes off my hips it goes to my knees the way it is off you but at that point if you have now i'm attacking i'm no longer heavy on you but you want to be at that point to remove any of the defenses they have or some of the defenses by getting their elbow now now i'm like either getting in trying to get your call or bringing your elbow across to talk to yamlak so what are some interesting details along the way that are tough to get to figure out what were the big leaps for you from white belt to to to the best in the world it's you're trying to attack the neck you know putting one hand in the collar you're prying yourself the hand to pace it on the floor yeah so now you're vulnerable to get bridged to get roll over because if your hands are free trying to roll you over you're stopped the moment they put your hand in the person's collar now you have to be very careful with the body positioning very careful the distribution of the weight yeah and how you you know how high you sit you know how tall your your your upper body goes and then the biggest challenge comes as you're trying the second hand that's the you know the for the choke that's the biggest challenge the second hand because you already have you you know you already don't have one hand now you you you you are trying the second hand and if one of my hand is in you are you as a defending yourself have two hands one hand is already on one side this this side is getting attack mhmm you have two hands blocking that i have one hand there's no help for that hand i cannot remove anything that's the biggest challenge getting one hand getting past two and not getting rollover but i also have to have two hands on bottom i have two hands and can also turn and and do all kinds of stuff yeah and my whole mind and everything is focused on that second hand yeah it's a big challenge it's hard very hard is there an art to getting the first hand into a place where you it's less of a art because it's easier i'll say most times i get my first hand in is when you you're trying some move you're trying to escape you're pushing i get the first hand in as an opportunity and it's gonna sit there for a while yeah and then and i go as deep as i can so the first hand because the second hand is the hardest i have to compensate the first hand to be as deep as i can right if i cannot get the first hand in deep i won't try the second i need the first hand deep then i go for the second and it's deep and everything is like super like tight super tight the first hand has to be super tight otherwise the chance of failing is very big okay does the opponent usually feel like they're screwed at that point also not as you put in the first hand in the moment that i position myself just prior to attempt the second hand i think the way i my my body is positioned the way i'm i'm collapsing with my weight and they feel this like it's i'm you know this is terrible yeah how long did it take you to figure out how to reposition your weight once the first hand is in very quickly or do i get bridged out okay so that there's a good feedback loop there because one mistake you're out like one off positioning you out but you still have to do that against the best people in the world yeah where where is the way out for most people like if you were in mount against preciousha or some of the best defenses in the world the the way out is to is the obviously is to defend themselves and you know prevent the first hand to get deep and i'll say the best thing that they could do is try to change my positioning on the mount in a way that you know push me to a very low mount mhmm you know try to just to to to to change the way i'm dominating you not to be you know get me off the high mount pretty much are you always is it a slow is it a fast thing to go from low to fast slow a high mount slow very slow because i need to beat your arms because you're holding me down yeah and the the arms need to come out it's it's a slow it's a slow process okay and you just is there like a yeah like that is is so i use my legs against your arms yep so it's my legs pushing your arms but how do you get them how do you get your legs into the elbows as long as this you know it has to come under the the tip of your elbow because now the legs will stop forcing your arms up so your legs aren't like spread out they're no they're in your elbow cannot get inside my leg right because that means i'm in a very low amount and then i cannot attack because i cannot ignore that because the moment that i attack that will it will stop pushing my leg to push me up what's the secret to getting the second hand in there's two ways either you go four fingers inside which is the hardest because the moment that your two hands are defending you'll be blocking the the the the you know the the way mhmm and i cannot clear and attack two hands against one so i go thumb and i go behind the ear yep so my my grip goes because for you to defend you need to get there yep and when you get there you elevate your airway expose the arm lock yep so it's hot and so you you put the thumb in and then there's the dreaded like the other person just waits for you to loop the arm over yeah but that the the this over it's a once you get the thumb in it's over okay no but when i'm there it's if i get the it because they're bridging you know they're trying i mean i'm not using their hand to post now your head is your head is very close to the floor when i've tried to bridge you know my forehead would touch the floor that would be used as a hand but it's not on the floor not necessarily okay because if it's on the floor my body's collapsed over you yeah so there's no place for my hand to for me to work on your neck so i need some space between us so i don't completely collapse can bob up and down kinda bob up and then i try to keep a gap between us cool so that pursuit that takes many many many many years i don't know if you've seen jiro dreams of sushi the doing the simple thing that's not so simple but it kinda looks simple of the over and over and over and over and over and presumably getting much better simple it becomes very simple but you're picking up details probably along the way there's wisdom along the way what is that is that there's like lessons that you just kinda accumulate over time like one training sessions you'll see maybe like the positioning of the thumb like this detailed positioning of the thumb or something like this and then you're like okay you like load that in that that will be very basic because there is not that many different ways maybe one two i just do one and the other is not as strong because it's it's about getting a strong grip on your collar i mean the sun is it's the thumb goes inside you know is it the thumb in or or or four fingers in but it's getting a strong grip on the collar as long as they they know this is just holding yeah and feeling strong so that's just two options so it's the dynamic stuff along the way that yeah and then some of that is timing too it's timing are you also like making people like faking them out making them think about something else no not at that point there's not because i cannot fake anything else at that point right because i i will have to change my positioning to you know maybe to fake an arm lock then i have to move out from that so then i will lose that the control i have so what's the process towards mastery if you were to convert that to something that generalizes beyond jiu jitsu how can you get that good at a simple thing practice and what that simple the same exact thing over and over it's just a matter of how long it would take you so all that's true that's true i mean like i said that's true look how long it took me people give up along the way there is intricacies to that journey towards perfection there's a lot of people that do jiu jitsu for decades and don't get better no because they don't train the way they should they don't train to get better they train to get tough there's a big difference most people they train to get tough so they are tough you know like we were talking before they don't practice their weakness you wanna be good at you wanna be really good at jiu jitsu you have to practice your weakness not your strength you have to practice everything but you have to be equally strong in every position they're all exactly the same you know your your guard top bottom side control top bottom turtle half guard mount back i mean you pick take down it's and then you get into details of escaping triangle applying the the you know triangle escaping arm lock different scenarios of you know it's the worst thing is defending the arm lock when you you know have your time your arms very close to your body the other thing is to defend the arms when your arm is you know almost getting and then when he he got your arms so there's so many things to practice that you need to repeat them over and over again until you're confident enough that when you get there you have a chance and you could do the same kind of thing for even the final stages of a cross choke from everything i mean of course like you don't practice escaping the arm lock with a full arm straight yeah because you know it's it that's gone i mean you you practice you know you practice escaping the arm lock when he takes your arm you have you know you have a chance of trying to escape but you don't practice you know okay take my arm when i say go go i mean you got you know you pop the arm that is like you get injured doing that escaping the cross collar choke it's i mean escape not letting the person get there yeah you can escape you can practice escaping triangles because you you know it's like it's you you have a way better shape of escaping triangle than okay mount to me put both hands in my neck i mean it's over you know don't be there what's the best submission in jiu jitsu a choke i would say for which for which position if if i gave you a billion dollars to start in a position like in a submission and you only get the billion if if you get the submission which one would you send call it chocking them up cross collar chalking them not from the back no you have a better chance escaping from the back really yeah even with the hooks even with everything do you think some people disagree with you i don't care i have a better escape i have a better chance escaping from the back than if you mount on me and put my hands on my neck so i've been that many times facing yourself and i will give you a billion dollars to escape you you would you would pick from the back wow thousand times over like really no comparison you have like with hooks with like a triangle like doesn't matter you can do whatever you want like a body triangle okay okay like a thousand times over so what no question so you the mount is a super controlling position it's not just because cross collar choke in the mouth the moment they put both hands on my neck you know you have to your arms needs to be very close to your body to attack so that mean there's very little space between us so that means there's very little escape space for you to work on your escape mhmm and the moment that you cannot bridge let's suppose i have you know the person has a good mouse so you cannot bridge him off what else you don't have space to try to work on your defense being in the back i have all the space around me to work on my defense and my arms i have the mobility to bring them anywhere so i because of that it gives you and me a much better chance and yeah you cannot i can move my body you feel you feel my back you you cannot pin me you i cannot take you off my back first i need to defend the the choke but you have no control over my body so that means there's still a lot of movement that i can try to use to escape in the mount there's no movement i'm pinned down i cannot move and i have no space between us to escape well the argument against that this is great is that on the bottom of mount i the i do have my hands between so you're saying they're pinned there's nothing between where i mean you could get them in theory you could somehow you could you could no you can but then there's no space they'll be squeezed between our bodies if it's an incredible if it's an incredible mount no it does not mount like how standing if i put both hands on your neck if i'm gonna go for the cross collar choke after i get my hands in the next step is to pull you close to me so it's this my arms needs to be close to me put there's a hands that could do something they can come in but there's they have very limited space between us yes yeah no i mean to push your body away to to do the power not if your back is against the floor sure okay the argument against the mount is or the argument for back control as being the most dominant position is even though i have hands i can't really use them effectively as effective not in the mouth there's no space in the mouth there's no space there's no space you can try i mean you can squeeze your hand in i mean there's there's still things that you could do mhmm but they're so limited so if you polled the hundred best competitors of all time what do you think that would answer to that do you think most would agree with you i don't care it's i mean it will show me the excuse the ability to see k so the perfect mount versus the perfect back control there's no question okay there's no question for for me i mean argue with me like show me because i'm not i'm not being stubborn because i'm being i've been scientific i'm i'm just like i mean explain it to me why i might change my mind i was trying to but it's i don't i don't have the cred i'm i'm like a middle school science student trying to talk to einstein here okay besides you who do you think is the greatest jiu jitsu competitor of all time can you make the case for some of them marcelo bushesha liangelo i'll have to go with bushesha because look at the how many titles he has i mean he has by far more than marcelo marcelo stopped quietly has eight but mushesh is better than him what do you think makes mushesh so good he's a heavyweight that moves like a lightweight he's he moves very fast but he's very agile for his size so the the agility combined with aggression yep so it's very hard to control him because he moves fast and he's a hundred and twelve kilos one hundred and fifteen sometimes or a hundred and ten i'm i'm not sure but he's about around that so two forty in in pounds so when you when you're agile two hundred to two hundred and forty pounds that makes it very hard to control you what about making the case for some others what about the little guys what about marcel if you were to make the case for him being the strongest what makes marcelo good marcelo guys he's extremely technical i mean i think he's he's one of my favorite jujutsu fighters because in in a technical way i think he's probably one of the best there's raw technique and a bunch of different positions for submissions he's he's not very powerful you know physically he's not very strong but he can make himself very strong and his technique is very very high level have you ever trained with him no i fought him twice yeah yeah but he's much smaller than me it's what happened in those matches the first fight i topped him i think five minutes in what which submission choke from the back color choke from the back and the second time i beat him by points but a very large yeah i think twelve too actually just to continue i wonder if if john donner would agree with you about mountain back i can't wait to this is a bear versus lion conversation i'm looking there's there's statistics about i'm not letting this go there's statistics about oh look at that hodger what do you know looking at hodger gracie statistics for most successful submissions choke from the back is the most so so how do you explain that miss scientist because people panic when i'm out they turn the back i choke them out that's one explanation but for people it is interesting that of course this doesn't capture but this captures a lot of your major matches and we should say that you've submitted most of your opponents so you rarely win on points you usually win submissions choke from back is most of them then cross choke from mount arm bar is a lot too so eighteen from choke from back twelve cross choke ten arm bar five r and c rear naked is for no gi okay so ezekiel's and then ezekiel's very powerful i took it out he's he's a strong weapon yeah also from mount also from mount oh that's when you can't get the one hand in no because the ezekiel most times i use against people is is that is the attack that as soon as i get to the mount when they're trying to escape they open up and i get them it has to be at that initial timing so it's not a thing you use to like bother them in order to create either either i get it right right away or i don't bother trying much got it because you need to keep one hand behind the head and that put you're naturally on that position as soon as you mount most of the times and the moment that you mount someone no one accept that they go mount it they're gonna explode to get out so holding the head it gives you a better way to dominate them initially you know to deal with that explosiveness on the on the initial on the beginning and then but then you have to let go to try it you're a very limited holding the head in terms of goats shanji i feel like he doesn't get enough credit that he deserves he had an extremely dominant performance in in competition what about salo and sanji hibero what are your thoughts about what makes them so good you had a bunch of tough matches with shange yeah and salo eight times eight times you fought yep fought eight times shange i fought salo once what i think i'm bringing up a sore point oh did shanji tap when you or or did the time run out in that was the last time you guys faced each other yeah two thousand and eight that was incredible to watch also i think you pulled guard with one minute left working towards attacking i mean it's it's probably very tough to to get anything and for people who don't know time ran out you had something that looked like an arm block and shanji looked like he may be tapping but it looked like he might be just celebrating which is most likely i'm not sure i i'm not sure it was i'm not sure because i think his arm just just straight his arm time finish yeah so i'm not sure if he was tapping to you know to let go time time time's up or because i would say most likely the time was up yeah and also there's a thing where you start you realize there's only three two seconds left you used to kinda start celebrating yeah you realize that hodges is not gonna be able to finish the samba bar in the time left so you start celebrating no i think he topped to say the time is up the time is up anyway what do you think like the longevity especially is impressive with with with shanji how long i think he doesn't get credit as much as he deserves because he pushed his career very far and the last few years he was on his best so he's if he would've stopped before you know you would people would remember him on his highest but he kinda pushed more than his peak let's say how hard is it for you to walk away we'll talk about the journey into mma as well but you basically especially with the second match against bushesi basically walked away on top beating arguably the greatest competitor of all time and just walking away it wasn't that hard to be honest because that was something that i was considering for a while because the last few years of my career let's say it was fighting mma at the same time i was fighting jiu jitsu and it was it's very challenging to do both like i don't there's not another person who ever did that because the training is a is a confliction with the way he trained everybody who start doing mma start focusing mma their jiu jitsu gets worse because they stop training with the gi everybody no exception was your jiu jitsu also getting worse no because i made sure i kept training with the gi and i kept fighting at least the world championship once i that was my goal i'm like i'm gonna go for mma but i i love jujitsu and i still wanna fight the highest level so i kept fighting wonsai for a few years it was a challenge especially because the two or three times when i competed at the worlds it was right after i made my fight ahead and then you know no gear don't you you you don't have the grips so in my grips it made a big difference on my grip so i was weaker grip wise so i felt that so i knew it was like it's it's unnecessary risk because i'm not if i cannot be a hundred percent so why why am i doing this but i'm stubborn i love jiu jitsu it's like i love fighting jiu jitsu i never loved mma i've liked it but i think if all greece i wouldn't done it so the the thing you felt the most is the grips yeah because you win a a gi world championship without gripping no like just pretending it's no gi match they get to grip you but you don't no so grips are essential of course i mean how can you choke someone like it's if if if your grips are weak you you you forearms will fatigue and then you will have no power and then you cannot do anything yeah you could still arm lock and you could so like i i meant more not for the submission but for the control of the game of it the the the day but you need to but you need to grip to get there to get there and if your grip's a weak but you you also have grips in no gi can't she use those grips no it's a thought experiment so like i'm trying to understand how essential when i get a get a no gi they panic they panic of course everyone panics a bear panics when they're in the water with a shark but that doesn't mean the bear can't still win when it stops panicking and relaxes it's not possible oh that's another discussion can a bear beat a shark in the water actually i need to maybe a polar bear because they're pretty good at swimming okay i say not possible for the no geek guy to win but the bears is a further discussion what was to you the biggest difference between mixed martial arts and jiu jitsu what are some interesting differences some interesting insights even just about the grappling within both sports so the biggest difference for me between mma and jujitsu is first is the speed like jujitsu you know like a ten minutes match i can take my time there's no dangers that that forces me to move fast mma you have to be a hundred percent sharp and fast from first second of the fight because punches are coming you can get knocked out any anytime one mistake you're out jujitsu don't have that like it's i don't have to worry about quick submissions because it's it's all about the way my body is positioned you know my grips is easy to avoid it's easy to see it coming like it's like a quick submission a surprise it only works if you make a mistake if you're not correct positioning mhmm otherwise it's impossible it's extremely difficult mma is is is not i mean one split second mistake and when the person comes you have to respond you have to to match his pace i mean you can't slow down but it's like you you're forced to respond so it's a much faster it's it's a it's a lot more physical a lot more and you need to be physical much better conditioning faster it's explosiveness it's much harder is it possible in mma to calm things down like if they change the rules yeah five minute rules no ah i see so like i i just meant actually technically speaking is there ways to to take an opponent that's being exceptionally aggressive you can clinch clinch but then he takes you down he he keeps moving something is hard to to control that pace you can you don't if you play defense you'll you'll save more energy than if you try to be the aggressor and respond and even getting to the clinch is very difficult yeah they you you have no way to hold yourself there so that was the biggest challenge for me in mma is is the speed because i'm a very slow start fighter if you look at my matches i start very slow because if i go hard you know i fatigue faster so for me that was the hardest part of is to start fast what about on the ground is there something different more challenging on the ground being in the bottom yes there's punches punch covers yeah how fundamentally different is jiu jitsu with punches on the ground it changes everything everything which which parts the the distance that you allow your opponent to be on you the techniques that you choose to apply you know you you you have to your body has to be aware of the punches and you know the you you are a lot more limited on your attacks like so you're you're known for your close guards how does your close guard have to adjust how how does the positioning of your hands have to adjust when you're on the bottom of close guard so in the guard especially in the close guard you you have to either keep the person very close to you or you have to kick him away mhmm that's the in the guard it's either i'm hugging you or get away from me and in jiu jitsu you're allowed to have a middle yeah in jiu jitsu there's a lot of you can't allow the person to be what about getting arm lock or triangle submissions from the from the guard is is that fundamentally different because you don't have the middle game it's much harder there's barely no open guard in mma very little because the the open guard there's a distance between you and him yeah there's a distance you how you you cannot control it's much harder to control that punch coming and i had to position myself a way to block that and it limited my attacks my options of attacks is there a reason correct me if i'm wrong but i don't think you do open guard much in jiu jitsu and no gi is there a reason for that it's harder with the explosive explosion of person because it's you know when they're moving fast then you have to try to slow them down so you like guards that allow you to control the person yeah and closed guard is the ultimate control it's not ultimate control but closed guard puts you in a position that i'm attacking and you're defending you you cannot attack me from my closed guard we we can argue that there might be one or two attacks but it's like very very very limited and depends who you're fighting against i hate the close guard being on top well against a good close guard is very no one likes it's it's terrible it's horrible yeah it's one-sided yeah so even the guardian is one-sided the person in the bar has the advantage i can be completely relaxed in my close guard and i cannot be completely relaxed you know what the most annoying thing is is somebody who is both good and extremely confident with a close guard yeah because they have that smug energy about them they know how much unpleasant how much work it takes to pass this anyway especially people with longer legs is there something you wish you did differently in how you started training in mma in that trajectory in figuring out how to train how to get good like what have you learned about getting good at mma from having done it if if you were to start now for example i think i would have to dedicate it more i didn't dedicate enough both like literally time number of training sessions training yeah but also mental training wise physical yeah i think a lot more the physical part of it the strikes everything the strike from the beginning it's because i mean i love jiu jitsu like it's i truly love the all all the aspects of it fighting training you know the practice the competition i don't have that for mma so it's hard to to give your heart to it something that you don't have the passion to it like jujitsu you know i gave my heart to it like i did everything that i had to mma i never i didn't do that so that's why it was i won't i won't say it was wrong for me to to have to to to do it because i don't regret doing i always you know looking back as a kid when i decided to you know to be to take jujitsu for life i i i already knew that at some point i will have to do mma there's almost like that's the path of a gracie you know you when you're ready you go do mma so so there was like a duty versus a love yeah that was that was not a choice that was like i have to it's just the the life i took you will lead that way are you proud of that stuff you know go against the natural love and towards more duty i think i don't regret it because if i hadn't done it i will feel there was something missing yeah so i don't regret doing that i would regret not doing the the tricky thing is the choice to go to mma could have compromised your ability to win against preciousia and it and it didn't and it's it's a fascinating case study it still doesn't make sense to me they after all those years you're able to come back and go against the best person in the world and beat him yeah and i had to because the first fight we had i had something stuck in my throat for a long time i had you you think so you think about that oh yeah i'm like well as soon as that first fight finished i had set i that got stuck in my throat that i already at that point i knew i'm gonna have to fight him again i knew i always knew because there's no choice i have to oh man alright well in in terms of no gi who do you think is the best no gi competitor of all time there's no question you know it's it's gordon it's i mean it's i don't think it's right to say the best competitor of all time because he's still very young i think that's something that it can be either in the end of when the person you don't want him to get lazy you know what i'm saying no no i mean but you cannot praise someone in the middle of his career yeah you know so it's you cannot call him the best ever he's twenty six or twenty seven so it's i mean he's he's great he's very good he's ahead of all of other competitors i think and i mean he's having an amazing career you know he's doing amazingly well so i mean when he's when he finish when he finally retired then you can argue like you know what the there's wisdom in that it matters how you finish right of course it's very interesting i think the no gi is relative new that nogi scene there was not there wasn't a scene before i think he started now on his generation you know his time because before like when i was competing no gear was just adcc there's nothing else every two years and my first was only in the emirates you know you still have you had to go there to compete so there was not even a scene there was like this one tournament that gives a lot of money to you know or to competitors to fighters and brings fighters from other modalities you know to marco van arsdale you know some wrestlers greco roman you know they can compete against each other and they you know they create that set of rules try not to favor anyone so that was it so you cannot be called the greatest doggy of all time if you only have one torment every two years only in emirates they have to be invited to but i think now you know it it grew a lot now we have so many different tournaments now we have a scene you have people that only train no gi they're fully dedicated to no gi and you have supervised different tournaments so now it's a there is now you you know now it's professionally you can do just no gi now which before was unheard of it because you you have one or two tournaments if you cannot be called a a no gi fighter fighting once or two once every two years twice every two years yeah no there's entire yeah systems that are optimized for no gi that could be fundamentally different like what do you think about the body lock like this passing with the body lock i i don't i don't know if you get an understanding of it yeah that i think it's okay it's a it's a popular way to what is it to maybe to apply to stay tight to stay tight very close to your parent your your your opponent so he can push great distance he can push away but somehow it shuts down the hips as well yep makes it more difficult to yeah defend trap your legs you'd see your your back is stuck on against the floor are are you like scientifically curious about these new developments do you think do you do you have answers in your head to them most so body lock is one interesting one obviously foot locks is another and that'll mean just the foot locks but the whole like control aspect of foot locks yeah that's interesting and there's other there's other interesting stuff john is really into the wrestling aspect but not wrestling wrestling but wrestling everywhere jiu jitsu at all levels of the plane that's that's very interesting because you know obviously jujitsu has not really been you know unlike like freestyle wrestling and so on has not been this like a systematic scientific rigorous exploration of wrestling it's like you're on your feet and you're on the ground not not yeah mix there's a lot of interest john is academic he tried to you know numbers mathematic everything well you kinda are too yeah no i mean i am because you have to understand what you're doing you know there's a everything there's a step by step like logistic like details every single move there's a reason for it you know there's things around that happens it's the the more you know the better you are right the more knowledgeable compared to whatever so i think with the footlocks with the nogi like if you look back you know if you think of it used to be seen as a really bad thing to attack the foot mhmm it wasn't seen as a good options of attack mainly what is it like respectable gentlemen don't attack the leg or what no because if you look back you know the tournaments the when they were created all the rules and everything else was to simulate a real fight with no punches manoa having a gi i mean if you ask what is jiu jitsu like what are you trying what's the main goal of jiu jitsu to dominate your opponent what's the main goal of fighting it's with fighting it's of course submission is the ultimate goal but the the you know before that the main goal is to dominate you like we're fighting i have to dominate you and then the submission comes and foot locks it's i don't require any domination on you i don't i i don't need to be in a dominant position to attack your foot and is this if i attack your foot you're still free to knock me out if your body goes down to my foot i can still come close to you or stand up and i'll punch you so it's not a a good position to be in a real fight yeah to attacking the foot i mean how many times you've seen that going bad that going bad in a in a in a mma fight i mean of course you had you know some sort of success with the hohoku it's no questions but how many times went wrong people were knocked out attacking the foot so you can't say it's the best position to be it's it's okay to go but it's a very high risky position to go so that's why it's not in a real situation it's not seen as a good thing so when you translate that to jiu jitsu and attacking the foot it's not seen as a good thing because when you reflect that to a to a real situation it's not gonna go down well so it was always seen as a as a easy way out you know easy cut you're trying you're trying to do the easy path you can't pass my guard you can't dominate me and then you're trying to attack my foot that's why it was always seen as a you know as not as the best a great submission of which win but the sad side effect of that is it was completely underdeveloped because of that exactly of course so people never really developed that but now the the tournaments the the fighting it got completely not completely but it got some it's not longer seen as you know as a simulation of the real thing now it's a now it's a sport it's only seen as a sport so now it doesn't matter if you attack my foot you cannot punch me so why is it bad now to attack the foot so it's not seen as a bad thing anymore and it it now it got really developed i don't know that's another bear versus shark question but you know there is in a street self defense situation it's possible to imagine where foot locks would be effective for highly but i guess if you invest ten thousand hours it's better to invest it in chokes yeah to dominate if i'm you know if i we're fighting it's way better for me to be on your side control on the mount where i can pin you be completely safe than to stay inside your legs trying to attack your foot what people would argue that there's a lot of very dominant controlling positions in the whole full log game right it is but it can go bad very quickly yeah just this no it it i mean there's there's some great ways to control someone that he cannot escape yeah but it can go bad very quickly that's the thing well even back control can go bad very quickly on the street so mount i don't know is mount a really good position but then the then there's no good position then there's no good position there's no there's no every every position there's a risk k attacking the foot is a way higher risk than side control mouth back that's what i'm saying the back is not the best way to pin someone unless you're underneath me because i if you try to rotate i can sacrifice the back and just allow you push be in the mount okay there you go would you prefer mount or back mount where they're flattened like steel mount sorry thought i'd get you so yeah going back to gordon what do you think makes that guy so good we were just a adcc you got to see him in a historically dominant performance his dedication the way he trains and how much he trains and of course you have to add his mind his belief to really try to be good the best or you know i don't know what his goals are but i know he's he's tried to be better than his opponents so his belief are very strong his dedication he probably trains more than everybody else i mean i haven't seen firsthand it but from what i hear interviews with him and everybody else training i you know the way everybody trains yeah you know trying to for my little knowledge i have i i'll i'll bet he trains more than everybody else and most important how he trains and when i i kinda already knew but when i heard john podcast with you the other day john was explaining the preparation the training for the adcc and that kinda gave me a very strong idea how they've been training all these years so you know when we said it's you have to work on your weakness so you have no weakness he trains a lot on his weakness which not everyone does that you know if you look other i'm not gonna name but you know other main schools went like very strong competitors great competitors super tough people but super tough not great because they train they spar very hard that makes them tough if you wanna be good you have to work on your weakness because when you spar like we're saying how many times you're gonna practice escaping a bad position like a submission hold or a pinning position a side control mount or it's very little the amount time you get to spend on those positions if you don't start there so that he's very smart the way he trains and part of that is also cerebral it's not just putting yourself in those positions but talking through different ideas yeah like they they talk they like experiment it's very like at at at first glance it's like philosophical almost as you're trying to create systems constantly you're trying to understand how this fits into this big picture and and then it goes back to what is jiu jitsu what is fighting he's fighting for dominance you know he's fighting for the ultimate dominance positions which is back and mount there's no others and from that you finish so if you look back at his you know over the years the the you know of his past fights before he used to mainly focus in legs and over the past two years now he's mainly focusing in finishing from the mountain back well that's when he became really good so part of that is mister john donahue what do you think you've you've you've known john for a long time what makes that guy interesting special and and good what have you learned about jiu jitsu and life from john donner he's super smart i mean eccentric and he lives through jiu jitsu he's twenty four seven thinking better ways to teach how to make his competitors better and that as a coach when you have that dedication as a coach that it makes the most difference of your athletes like which are the big team you have that coach with that motivation all the other schools is it someone that competes that push the training like andre gervont mhmm it's you know he's one of the competitors so he brings the hype in everyone else but he doesn't have the time he doesn't spend the time working in individually i mean i'm sure he does but it's limited because he's also a competitor and you know looking most of the other big schools like you don't have that now they all the leaders the the main coaches for the other big schools they have other things other things in their lives they could not don't fully dedicate it to the athletes joined us you know look at the interview he spends hours and hours a day studying how can a way the system you know to make his athletes better look at the results i i enjoy just sending back and forth you can actually just get him you control him essentially by sending interesting videos and you could just see his mind he's gonna do research on that because i kept sending him videos of bears because he claimed that a lion would beat a bear because i'd i'd love to get your take on this okay so the bear is much bigger much stronger but his take is that the bears don't have experience of fighting to the death that's not part of the culture they're more scared in fact he keeps sending me footage of like even like a small mountain lion scaring a bear away because they're they don't want to fight so his idea is that it really matters your life experience how much you fight it's not necessarily the skill like the dimensions the the characteristics you have but then i send them yeah i'll show you people should google this it's bears fighting of any kind it's it's pretty much the most epic thing ever here i'll show you like look at these guy the cardio though is interesting you know it's funny i i was gonna mention that because i was you know flipping to internet i've came i came around that video look how big these guys are no they're huge but see they don't bite each other you think it's just play they're trying to no intimidating because they don't wanna get hurt so they try to size each other up you know they've they they'll see the whole fighting is sizing each other up there's a lot of pushing and the the the the fur is so thick so the cloth doesn't really damage much and they're using the tree so maybe they they yeah the the i mean they they they there is bites but see there's very little so the whole time they're trying to intimidate the other one like winning the fight by their size and mostly about like the way drunk college kids fight which is like some kind of display of dominance versus actual yeah they're not fighting to kill and bear or tiger you know they they fight to finish unless the other one runs away like one would die yeah well the lions and tigers yeah i but look at the cardio look how bad their cardio is i wonder how my favorite part is when one of them just like stands behind a tree and says alright he's holding she's getting let me catch my breath he he sits down he's like alright you can't it's over it's like it's the equivalent in the in the in the forest like tapping out alright alright you got me let me just just get you where look they're both like just shot and but see the thing is that i was trying to make an argument for is that we we get this rare footage it's not rare i mean there's like hundreds of videos but it's not millions of videos because there's a huge number of bears and i was trying to say that there's some badass bear we don't know about because he just goes in there and just does work and we just don't know about it because he's like ever see the thing is if you kill a lot of other animals you probably have a territory that nobody's gonna mess with you so it's very hard to catch the the like the hodge gracia bears you know he's just gonna be sitting there doing nothing so i don't know i don't know i feel like of course when you corner him john will say that if you put a bear and a lion in a cage the bear will win if it's like if it's the if if they're forced to beat to the death but i don't know oh let me ask you another ridiculous thing before i ask you serious questions so joe rogan thinks that a tie is an effective way to attack somebody i don't know if i i can't believe i haven't in a time in vegas i didn't talk to you about this i think it's not have you ever explored this it's it's the best choker in the world have you ever explored the use because like jujitsu has the jacket but the tie to me is a pretty shitty way to choke somebody like intuitively it thinks like it's a good way but it can slide around it's it feels like if it feels like there's no there's no way to really pin you would need to right so you use it the way you use a belt yeah essentially yeah but then i would i would guess so yeah that i don't i don't think it's and i i think if it gives you it actually has the reverse effect which it gives you the the false sense of confidence that you can use it and instead it'll just distract you so he think it's a stronger weight than the collar or just a strong weight yeah stronger than the collar yeah yeah i don't see how maybe i just act well in a street fight scenario right like but by the time you grab the tie the guy go punch your nose yeah but what what george saint pierre thinks is the best use of the tie is to actually like what do you call that so basically to off balance them that's an interesting point to like i mean to put that in the use too yeah but you could use the jacket for the same kind of thing yeah i don't know i haven't really fully tested it it's a a i'll say jacket or tie on for that perspective of on balancing unbalancing off balancing the person it can be yeah because you you know you have control of the person's neck the collar you know the jacket moves so for the purpose of off balancing the person i would agree with george see the thing is that's the thing about martial arts is you can say all kinds of bullshit but until you really test it in over a period of years the competition you won't really know i think like that's where my gut says just how easily the time moves my gut says the collar there is something really powerful about the jacket there's like the way it sits i mean the fact that the arms trap it from rotating yeah like it's a weird piece of clothing it's a really dangerous piece of clothing that we put on ourselves yeah like and it's kinda cool that we've developed this whole martial arts system that allows you to use that to to to do a lot of damage it's very interesting so when we're saying something that you develop over the years of practice over and over again going back to the fissures of the amount or back by experience of attacking people they people always had a much higher chance of escaping from the back than from my mount so it's i feel if if i mount and you get both my hands on your neck you cannot escape if my hands are deep it's over like that i don't remember anyone escaping but i do remember if my hands are deep on your collar or even your naked choke it's still a hassle like it's not clean you have some data on this is there some aspect to you to how your body is the characteristics of your body that that fits a particular set of techniques so if we just look at jiu jitsu broadly do you see most techniques being able to work for most people like what you're saying about mount versus back control is this is it possible for a different body type the mount is not as effective yeah of course i'll say very big people they should amount you don't think of yourself as big no big i mean fat oh they should stay off the mountain why is that that's a cut out of the mouth is it mobility it's like it's i think you know you don't see any you know like there was she weighs like a hundred and sixty kilo like you know in pounds i don't know two hundred and seventy pounds of a lot of fat it's you you need a bit of mobility and that wouldn't it will play against you so even even even back a great amount the same requires mobility yeah okay so even though it doesn't look like you're moving very much when you're doing model that requires mobility yeah because you have to reposition and wait for distribution adjust in your your body alright the legend goes you got very good by training mostly with lower ranks what was your training like in that environment so when i first moved to london i was twenty years old i opened my school there and i had nobody to train with i had one guy that was teaching with me a black belt middleweight it was good and that's it bralo was he moved to the same this to he moved to england the same time as i did but he was in birmingham so we did got together you know maybe twice a week close you know when we were preparing for something if not then not very often as often as we could but like did i say not that often and i had just call about students there was no one high level there was no one world champion in any belt to train then you need to create a scenario that simulates that can simulate you know like a realistic fighting so i think on that aspect you know when people said you know people ask why they have such a basic game i think that also influenced me sharpen up all my skills when i moved there because you know when i'm when if you practice with people you know lower level than you you cannot there's nothing to to learn from them or you know you can learn things and practice with them but i would say very complexing on them it is not the best so it's i sharpen up all my skills so you know that would not really improve everything that i already knew to a higher level but how can you sharpen something if the resistance is much lower level than a purple belt can makes it very hard for you to skip side control don't have to be a war champion or black belt it's you know if he's one is holding you it can be very hard what about on the attack how do you how do you become literally by far the best person at the cross stroke from mount by training with purple belts it's sometimes purple belts defense way better than black belts okay see a lot of people listening to that would be like that makes no sense hadra gracie what how does that make any sense because like a lot of the black belts even world champion they get to the black belt they're really good in what they do let's say in the guard you know on top or in the bottom position but their difference are not like very very few people high level have a very good defense because they don't practice yeah then that goes back to how you train you know you can be very tough very tough will make you terrible defense because you're not gonna practice your weakness mhmm so your weakness is still gonna be terrible you can have the best guard in the world impossible to pass the day people pass your guard you're nothing like it's your your guard is high the highest level but your side control difference or not mhmm your mount difference or not so some purple bells they practice this you know the the the mount way more than the black belt did so then naturally the difference is better so they they get to experience the defensive position much much much more and especially training with you they get really good at defending yeah and then over and over again you attack them with the same thing over and over again and they know what's coming they will block they will develop a defense over that yeah way better than most other high level black belts so both put yourself into really bad positions with lower ranks yeah and just keep attacking the same way over and over and over yeah yeah and with that you're able to be at the at top of the world at the world championships yeah i mean can you give some like what was the preparation like to a world championship with the lower ranks i mean i did a lot of boxing a lot of conditioning no but the your conditioning is a good condition yeah but the one thing that helped me extremely living in england in london was training judo at a in london that helped me massively because it it it gave me the motivation to learn something new because it you know the the by then at the burakwa i didn't know the stand up was i'm sure today it is too but by then it was even higher than it is today like there was some very high level judo guys training there and i mean the first time i went there my stand up was terrible compared to theirs i mean it was it was bad but compared to them it was terrible so i was getting through like a child and that motivate me to kept to keep coming back and and and get better so that made my jiu jitsu much stronger i became my base got better my top game improves my pressure game improved did does neil adams train ray stevens ray stevens when he i've never met neil adams ray stevens have you met neil adams he's the he's the voice of judo i don't know if you you watch the tournaments he's incredible yeah ray stevens is a super mad silver medalist in the olympics he won european he won a lot so you did some judo training what's your favorite throw like asolo like you know with chimata i would say chimata if i would pick one so that made you better at chisiza as well yeah yeah okay and and back then like for the first i'll say maybe three years maybe four i went to brazil for like two months before every major tournament got it so i say you know i'd move away from the school and i really focused i was really well prepared with my judo and everything else sharpen up my skills and then went going to brazil to train with like really high level people so that way i would manage it to compete in the highest level what advice would you give to let's start with a complete beginner so you know a a bunch of people come up to me they still wanna start doing jiu jitsu what advice would you give them try to absorb as much technique as you can and try to be as relaxed as you can don't you know don't desperately trying to fight so hard like learn and move slow move slow and relax that's the hardest thing to do the hardest you know you know what i find with people it seems like it's hard to even know that you're not relaxed it's it's like the introspection they don't even know what it feels like to relax not even know they tense yeah right they try to relax they look at you say what what do you mean relax i'm relaxed exactly exactly your eyes are shaking you feel it and in terms of going slow they're like yeah well i am going slow no you're you're not yeah yeah there's there's a there's a grace and elegance of movement that you can probably pick up from a lot of other disciplines like for me i think that came from just learning piano piano at a young age it's for i think any mobility thing to learn how to move efficiently you have to know how to relax yeah so just the fact that you can like the body can be tense or it could be relaxed just knowing that fact now imagine you show this tense yeah do you think you play play piano well no yeah everything has to be relaxed i guess some of that is mine too but just knowing that and being self aware and you but see like even me you know approaching a thing i'm not i don't know anything about being a beginner you're going to tense up no matter and like it actually takes a cautious effort to think to relax i mean that's massively that's why learning things as an adult is much harder than as a child like it's very hard and as an adult it's like to get to the highest level it's not possible because you will never relax for the way you should yeah relax in a way that you become like water but then you solidify in the right places yeah yeah is there advice you can give to an adult so like somebody that has a job like a hobbyist like how to progress how to get i mean have i did train there's you just need to train as much as you can not you know five seven days a week because you get gonna get injured i mean two or three times a week to start is the best way to to you know to to to to initiate your jujitsu journey and practice the same thing over and over again when they don't work it's just because you're not doing well not because you know you have to learn something else do you see some value in just picking a set of techniques that seem that seem to draw your heart in like for example i'll give you an example you'll get a yell at me but i never learned the close guard well it just never connected with me you could say it's body mechanics whatever it doesn't matter the point is it just like my heart never connected with it you know the way i justified it to myself is i felt like when you're bad you're using the close guard just like you could use the half guard to stall so i was really drawn to the butterfly guard as a beginner because i thought there i have or open guard in general there's i have no options to stall so i'm going to learn my thinking was let me do the guard that enforces me to learn and then i fell in love with the butterfly guard and the open guard and so on and i never i never really understood the closed guard and the other thinking was do i really need to understand the close guard because it's always by choice that i go there so i can avoid not being able to avoid anything you want i mean you don't have to do anything that well in this life yes it doesn't make you complete that's that means you have to agree with you complete as a this is the question how valuable is it to be complete to get good depends how good you wanna be okay let's go well there's several questions there yeah okay the the like to be the best in the world do you need to be complete of course the best in the world of course you have to be complete otherwise you somebody's gonna be better than you but what about like to so to understand to defend you have to be also good at the offense and of course in every single position otherwise you you have a weakness and someone can capitalize in that weakness okay what about to be like a hobbyist then you don't have to but can you or is this still bad i mean it's not bad i mean nothing is bad i mean if you as a hobbyist you start late i mean it's it doesn't matter how far you're gonna get as long as you enjoy it just train as much as you can mhmm if it's twice a week twice a week it is you'll be limited how good you will be training twice a week of course then the guy that trains twice a day you know it's just the more you train the better you get but you have to select what you train that's what i'm asking so no no no yes but like for how long like there would some point in your life that you might try something see if you like it you know so there's some point in your life that you might okay let me try close guard you might not like it now maybe in two three years from now nope still don't like it i i kept trying it listen because listen it's very difficult to get any respect in jiu jitsu it's get it's hard to get to black belt and beyond in jiu jitsu at a respectable place and not have a good close guard close guard is business i mean it's then then don't do it it's not necessary being a rebel no no it's not it's i'll say because it's not it's not a position that you under pressure that if you don't know you'll be in trouble you're not gonna be in trouble not to know their close guard you're just gonna go straight for open guard i mean the the it's not a problem the main limitation is if you don't do close guard a lot that you don't quite you don't get a full complete picture of understanding how to attack close guard when somebody puts you into a close guard when you're on top so it's nice to know both sides if it's just to understand yeah but you can have a pretty good understanding of how to defend from the top and not having any bottom i mean some of it is also just like the length of legs and just the the the geometry of your body yeah nick i'm i'm sure marcel garcia has a good close guard but i don't i've never seen that that's that's exact that's the point i'm trying to make in theory in theory you can imagine it but like for a hobbyist i think it's interesting to think of that like it is it possible to is it possible to focus on a on a small set of techniques that help you to develop yeah of course still into a good jujitsu player of course and still enjoy and still be able to people hobbies in the in the jujitsu world ninety nine percent i mean people that compete yeah even the people that compete in one percent max and you have high level competitors have no clue what close guard is okay thank you for me sweetie no i think you would say that most people don't have an coast guard is such a such a difficult position to understand for me maybe one day we'll brainwash yeah good i i felt it's too easy to stall versus attack that that that was my main concern it's like i wanna be forced in every way to to to always be attacking to always be moving to always be and it felt like if i got really good i've seen it happen with half half guard too it's like when people get really good at half guard it's it just feels stally if you just look at this at at the matches and so on it's you just slow things down to a thing that's not you don't get reps on learning you don't get action in interesting ways so that was my worry that i'll get old and fat and just sit in close guard all day holding on to the white belts trying to kill me because it's also i mean that's the other thing for hobbyists and for everyone is to and like when you first start i think you have to relax in the face of the fact that you're just getting your ass kicked nonstop yeah that can also be really tough on the ego i think probably the right way to see that is you're growing as a person you see that clearly when they are like in a bad position let's say side mount or mount like a beginner he will never relax on those position the moment that you say go they like try to push you out and explode there's no relaxation and work on the different it's like no it's out and go until i have zero to give until i'm exhausted my arms cannot move it's kinda fun to watch actually what's the role of drilling do you do you like drilling i do not like drilling but i'll tell you why i think you you if fighting is mechanic right so it's it's it's very important to drill a move until you learn the mechanic of course it's important if someone wanna teach you an arm lock you wanna practice that movement until you learn the mechanic of it but the guy's not resisting so it's easy to apply it right so you apply as many times as you have to until you know the mechanic of the moves until you can apply the mechanics the moment that you know how to apply there's no more point in drilling now you have to practice now you have to practice with resistance of course you're not gonna practice with the guy fully resisting the guy is better than you because he's not gonna give you a chance to practice that move but you have to practice with resistance so where does drilling comes on that is most of people you know they they flow drill and everything i think whatever you do you're conditioning your body to do something is there you know you do you repeat the same move over over and over again as your body's conditioning to apply that movement or the technique drilling is not realistic because the other person is not resisting you know the flow movement or whatever after you go beyond when you already know the the the mechanics the drilling with no resistance is not gonna teach you anything because you will never know if how to apply the movement with resistance so it's pointless to carry on drilling after you learn the mechanics see but you're making it sound easy to learn the mechanics i would argue you can drill as many time i'm not limping how much you drill yes you drill as as long as you had to i mean it doesn't matter how long the benefit of drilling i'm just playing devil's advocate with you the the benefit of drilling is that you can more efficiently get a higher number of reps in so what are you gonna gain with those reps understanding the mechanics of the movement yeah and what i would like to argue is you don't necessarily need a resistance to deeply understand the mechanics of something now i don't know there's some no for some there's some moves like i bet you you could drill your way to an incredible mount like oh mount is a good example of that you don't really need a resist one i can imagine a world in which the resisting opponent is not essential for developing some of the very fine details of the mechanics which one because i don't know any what you say mount yes what what you're gonna achieve by resist by drilling with no resistance after you learn the mechanics he mounts but see what i'm trying to tell you the learning of the mechanics isn't a thing where you get a certificate and you're done you're gonna learn the fine details of the way you redistribute your weight you're going to learn how to move your i don't understand my inside a dead body what yeah like every everything you do is a slow process and timing you do have to timing you keep you have to understand moving okay it's the guy's resisting like he's not i'm not gonna grab you and apply the movement i need to grab you and feel when is the right time to do like that that only comes when you with with movement if you're not fully resistant how would i know you couldn't infer through it it's like a with no movement with no resistance like arm lock some resistance arm lock let's see arm lock you you okay okay let's say you've been drilling for a week yep five hours a day mhmm you should be an expert with the mechanics but now how are you gonna carry on drilling with no resistance no you have to be yes yes after that week drilling five times five hours a day the the arm lock you still have no clue how to apply the arm lock against a resisting opponent mhmm no clue zero yeah so you don't know the movement you know the mechanic which is you know it's like how long you have to drill and how that doesn't matter it's it's it varies of the person you can do for a month after that month is over you should understand how the mechanic works you still have no clue how to apply the movement against a resisting opponent you will never ever know how until you apply with a fully resisting opponent yeah that's the the only way to know to to to really learn a movement yes well put but the question is can you have a small percentage of time when you go against the resisting opponent to get the wisdom and the insight of what it takes to perform that movement and you spend the large percentage of other time just practicing the mechanics of it so like do you need to as you get better and better at technique to basically drift away completely from drilling and more into the the sparring i i'd like to i just you like drilling no i don't like drilling i see i well yes i like drilling i would say but i just see it always bothered me in the jujitsu community how few people really saw the value of drilling i've seen it in wrestling especially in the in the russian style of wrestling like the value of drilling i don't necessarily mean that it's like a dead body or like a dummy or something like that but just getting the reps in really focusing on the high amount of reps i agree in wrestling and judo i agree that drilling is very important initial drill a thousand times each move yeah judo is a really big one for that too it is because it's it's it's the movement the the timing you know it's it's the precision of the movement yeah it has to be perfectly because it's one movement then it's you you learn about the timing of the movement when you're fighting but doing fighting you only need to know the time because your body movement is exactly the same when you drill that's really well put yeah the mechanics is much more important there yeah but it's completely different for jujitsu because let's say from jujitsu like the arm lock for example we we use that as an example let's see from the closed guard even my closed guard before i go for the arm lock i need to have set of grips let's say i have your collar and your arm right and then you know when you're drilling i'm gonna grab your arm i'm gonna grab your collar and i'm gonna drill my body until i can apply the arm lock and finish and i can do that a thousand times okay now we're fighting we start with the grip the moment that i initiate the arm lock attack you will defend the arm lock it will not work so it's not the one movement that will get me to attack the arm there's a there's a combination of other things that i need to do i need to feel about your weight you know i need to get you close to me there's so many other things involved that i need to fill that only comes with life life with with a fully resistant opponent yeah and so pretty quickly it has to be live yeah and then it comes how you practice how you train you're starting on that position and just saying let's go and the moment that we disengage from that position we go back that's when you really learn because everything that you do wrong you're gonna go back there and you're gonna try again try again try again and the repetition it will teach you have a feeling of timing when to go if there's you know there's other combinations which you you always has to go with it by the way for the internet that's currently yelling at me for arguing with hodge gracie about drilling that that's called you know playing devil's advocate to strengthen to explore ideas i'm not actually arguing okay i forgot to ask you if you had to fight against the bear line gorilla or anaconda to the death which one would you choose and would you be able actually to win against any of them we'll have bear a lion a tiger a tiger anaconda oh gorilla too gorilla you can go gorilla i'll probably choose the anaconda i see was that i mean you're not allowed to run away though so you're in a cage do you do you have to kill still the so the other one okay i think i have no chance against any other ones zero chance my head what john think i think i have a title hero against the anaconda just wait it out you don't you don't think it's possible to be i just it it feels like technique can do something against these animals but they have so much strength so much aggression you you know the the real naked choke translate into portuguese is kill the lion so ever since i was a kid i always thought that maybe if i get behind a a lion the real naked choke which you know in portuguese it says mate leon so mate leon is kill the lion mhmm so i always thought that that's the only way to kill a lion or to you know to fight against a lion go behind it put the real naked choke i think you put him to sleep or the name is like kill the lion yeah someone came up with the name why somebody must have maybe someone he was a fight with the lion choked him up there you go john there you go i i honestly do you think or so actually yeah you you understand controlling positions do you think like animal like a gorilla or lion would shake you off if you had back full you locked in well i should say the one that'll have the biggest chance of staying there is a lion because you just thinner body yeah he's smaller than a tiger i guess i think tigers are bigger yes so so do you think they can shake you off though i think i'll have a bigger chance of staying against a lion's back than any other animal still not answering the question do you think you have a chance if i start on the back yeah start full locked in full controls let's say it's a small enough line that you can actually have a full i i would guess so i mean i i i would like to believe so okay well like just like you said somebody must have been able to do it throughout your journey in jiu jitsu have there been low points like has there been points where you really doubted yourself no i never really doubted myself there's low points in defeats that those are the low points when i lost how did you deal with defeat i just went back to the gym next week and say i need to get better that every time i i lost i'm like i need to get better because i need to choke them out i i need to submit them because you know we're in my points it's as a black belt i have very very little loss i would say i mean i don't like to sound like a crime baby but i'll say most most of those loss was very very controversial yeah there it was not a dominant clear performance it has about referees and points and so on everything i was since i was very young i always fought against my opponent and the referee like it's if there was ever in my whole life since i was a kid there was ever a doubt they you always go to my opponent always always that was just something that i had to do with my whole life yeah what's the motivation behind what led to the fact that you win most of your matches by submission or in dominance like are you chasing because that's the only way to prove you're better and i'm never i never fought to win tournaments that was never my goal that was the consequence of me trying to be the best like i don't care how many titles i have i care about i need to beat all my opponents and not not win because win is not enough i have to submit them that's the only way to prove i'm the best to submit them if i win by advantage or a point that means i was better than them that day that does not mean i'm better than them if there's no place to stay top if if i take you down pass your guard mount and submit you there's zero questions who's the best like there's nothing you can say about it if i foot sweep you you put your butt on the floor i get an advantage we carry on a fight and then i win means nothing not even means i'm better than you and if that happened that would haunt you it is for me it's not enough i wouldn't be happy what advice would you give to young folks who look at you with able to accomplish from a place where you're not very good to becoming the best in the world at a thing what advice would you give them to have a journey like that to have a journey where they could be successful in their career and their life to to to such a high level determination is the most important thing you need to know where you're going together so you need to have a goal which whatever that goal is like you need to set the goal for yourself so you know where you wanna go and to have the determination to get there and be sure that you will fail many times like you cannot let your failures brings you down because you you will fail many times everybody does so you said you didn't look to external sources of belief you just believed in yourself yeah is there something to that where you had to try to like be your own source of belief flame the fire within yourself was that was that something difficult to do like but that was just very natural for me i said you know you can surround yourself with great people that is extremely important don't surround yourself with failure because they will they're not gonna push you to you know they don't know what it is how to get there i mean everybody knows but it's when you surround yourself with winners you know you will know what it took them to get there use them as an example yeah there's a certain kind of aura to people that just achieve great things and being around them but it's still it's hard to find people that especially at that early stage any any area yeah any area that's right yeah greatness has a certain i think it's almost humbling just to see okay any human like at least that's the lesson i learned almost any human can do can be great i mean one i've used muhammad ali as a great example look at his belief look at how much he believed himself before he was muhammad ali look at the you know determination he had the way the confidence he had fighting even on his loss they never changed him now when he fought foreman george foreman i'd not not one person in the world thought he was gonna win that fight by himself he never doubt himself everybody else did he won over all odds against so it's i mean you you when you look at people like that you can you don't have to be a boxer to try to you know follow his example but see those are like epic giant battles but i feel like you fight the same kind of battle when you're young and your parents tell you that you know just with their whole energy that this is silly don't be silly don't don't be silly to chase it's harder it's it is harder but as a kid it's harder to deal with that because i mean to go against adults especially parents telling you otherwise like the the the amount of strength you need is i it's gigantic i don't even know how much strength you need because that was not my case so i can understand what you have to go through with the with the force of your parents telling you you know otherwise but it's how much you want it will dictate how far you're gonna go where you're gonna go so it's you know if you can break through that you get nowhere it's that simple and actually one of the really nice things the internet does that i would give advice to young people is like you can find even even if your parents are not a source of that your teachers your community you can find people on the internet will believe in you yeah it's kinda cool it's it's kinda cool how the internet opens the possibility of like a community of like ten eleven year olds like building shit i i see this all the time engineering they and they i mean they're fueled by belief they want to they want to be like they want to create the next trillion dollar company right there there there's that fire in their eyes and not for the money obviously but to do something really impactful and i think that fire is extinguished often by teachers and and parents because i think the logic that parents have and teachers they look at a kid and they don't on the surface level they don't see greatness right they just see kinda mediocrity and so to them it's like no right the world is more complicated than that in order to get great you have to like like they they somehow kinda always try to be reasonable with you and in so doing extinguish the flame it's weird i think most people afraid so to even try so you can call them cowards for not trying because you are a coward for not trying not putting yourself at risk right so i would say big part of society are cowards for never trying never pursuing what they really want it's so it's there is you know a a a a a weight a pressure everyone most people a lot of people i'll say around you that because they were afraid to try they they don't incentivize people to do so because they want everybody to be like them because imagine if everybody around you suddenly are not afraid and everyone is trying and you look yourself in the mirror and say i was too scared i've never tried so you feel really bad about yourself so it's easier to have people around you that think exactly like you than otherwise so they reflect a lot on the kids it's you know society almost like pressed them down to be like everybody else to have a normal life normal job it's you know don't take risk because you can lose it all i mean that's the worst thing you can tell everybody take all the risks lose it all a few times that's how you're gonna build things especially when you're young yes you can recover much exactly what's the point of not trying you should try and you should and you will lose everything doesn't matter what's what's what what it matters to lose at everything it does matter he will teach you resilience you know try harder go after you know it's don't don't live a normal life because otherwise you mean what we're here for yeah take big risks take a lot of them fail and fail and fail and fail say you a thousand times until you succeed and then you're gonna you'll be the most proud of yourself like if there's there's they're not be priceless it's that then we'll change the world it is true that most people are not necessarily cowards but have cowardice in them it's most people are just afraid to try you know and a lot of it comes from a place of love because you know if you try and you fail you you get hurt and it hurts i mean it's not it's not a pleasant thing to fail i mean you feel terrible to think you know when i lost any time it was a good thing you know and take when i was getting beat up at the gym over and over again was a good thing when i was getting there and getting smashed by all the good guys i think i liked it well i hate it but it's my resilience that you know make me carry on till i succeed i think i like to get tapped well i'm the most competitive per one of the most competitive persons you know i hate right to lose but it's i accept i mean i just i just need to get better every single time i lost in the championship i hate it you'd i've never screamed no one never saw me screaming shouting that you know i got robbed you know i should've won the referee yeah but you know screwed me over i mean it's okay it happened shit happens i need to get better because i don't wanna be in that position ever again so when i fight if i'm better if i tapped him there's no question i don't need to wait for the referee to decide that there was points or no points if you know his interpretation that made me better because i i was even more determined to be better in my mind i have to tap everybody else winning is not enough it's just objectively speaking what you learn the most from is really wanting to succeed and then failing and doing that often that's the reality from a parent from a teacher perspective from anybody from people you love if they really wanna do something help them do that thing if you think they're gonna fail good help them do that faster so they fail faster of course and they're gonna learn the only way to succeed is failing there is no other way that's what people has to understand yeah without failing there is no success since you've gotten a little softer a little more emotionally open what's the role of love in the human condition haja gracie probably the most important thing that's the basic of everything right it's i mean love brings the best of us it's if we had more love and compassion from from the other person i think the world will be a more evolved species the world would be a much better place than it is now did friends family help you along the way yeah a lot i always had a lot of love and help from many people that's why i succeed i never got here by myself i had a lot of people who loved me believed in me and helped me get to be here today well i'm glad they did i'm glad you're here today i'm a huge fan it was an honor to meet you it was an honor to hang out with you in vegas to hang out with you again today i've just been a huge fan for a long time my pleasure man thank you for everything you're doing thank you for this conversation it was awesome thank you very much thanks for listening to this conversation with haja gracie to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from haja gracie himself jiu jitsu is simple you just have to do it right thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
