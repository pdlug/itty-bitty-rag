but if you skip them please do check out our sponsors i enjoy their stuff maybe you will too this show is brought to you by house of macadamia it's a company that ships delicious high quality and healthy macadamia nuts directly to your door which they did just today another shipment i got in my hand an unopened box dipped macadamia's chocolate flavor this is the one i went through first last time and it was delicious it is an incredible source of happiness for me i knew for a long time that macadamia nuts were really healthy because i remember when i was first exploring okay so on keto what is the way to get fats into the diet because it has to be a high fat diet and i was looking at nuts and i was thinking of it okay which which nuts nuts are the healthiest and i remember macadamia is always coming up to the top of the list i'm gonna try not to eat all of them so that i have some for guests when they come over because it's like a perfect guest snack it's healthy it's delicious it's just pure perfection they also sent me some macadamia bars which were also delicious last time i probably prefer the whole nuts i'm i'm i'm nuts for nuts anyway go to haasem macadamias dot com

shirt and i love it i have a ton of them sometimes when i do these ad reads i struggle to try to convey exactly why i like this particular piece of clothing which is where i i wish there was like a brain computer interface way to directly communicate the actual experience of wearing the clothing and if you get a large number of people with that data you get a sense of okay well ninety six percent of people feel good in this that's a good chance that i will also feel good in that's fascinating of course you could get that through self report surveys but it'll be nice to get direct data because you can't lie but the feelings don't lie but then again there could be other kinds of variables like what else is going on in your life you might be just in a bad mood about something else or

system when i sleep forever and that's source of a lot of happiness i recently tweeted about the number of hours there are in a regular lifetime you know if you live seventy to eighty years old there's about six hundred to seven hundred thousand hours in a life and i think a large percent of those hours is spent sleeping of course you could think of sleeping as a important process for health to regenerate your energy and all that kind of stuff but it is also in itself a source of happiness and i think you wanna use the best bed for the job there's just not a better feeling of a cool

perhaps a common intuitive notion but the giving of money to alleviate some of the suffering in the world or to improve the quality of life for a bunch of people in the world is not an easy problem i mean there is so many challenges and there's just a lot of studies behind the principles that givedirectly operates under which is if you actually give money to the people most in need they're going to themselves spend that money to maximally improve their life this too is a counterintuitive notion but it works time and time again like many things i have so much to learn in this world about challenging problems like this so philanthropy is definitely one of them so i should also mention that a bunch of guests previous guests of this podcast have used to give directly to donate money jack

this show is also brought to you by blinkist my favorite app for learning new things blinkist takes key ideas from thousands of nonfiction books and condenses them down into fifteen minutes that you can read or listen to i set the goal of reading one book a week i said it a classic book but really what i mean is a book that really challenges you and and really makes you think so i look forward to seeing sort of using blinkist to help me review the books actually also choose the books and maybe help others that are interested in following along to with my reading to get deeper and deeper insights into these different books i think my perspectives on many books i read are nonstandard i get lost on a single quote here and there and it just kind of takes me down this whole tangent of thought these ideas that get inspired and get sparked and then i i i just construct this whole world from a single quote sometimes but that's what makes it interesting it's a very subjective

out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's betul kacar what is the phylogenetic tree or the evolutionary tree of life and what can we learn by running it back and studying ancient gene sequences as you have i think phylogenetic trees could be one of the most romantic and beautiful notions that can come out of biology it shows us a way to depict the connectedness of life and all living beings with one another it itself is an ever evolving notion biologists like visualizations they like these graphics these diagrams and tree of life is one of them so the tree starts at a common ancestor it's actually the other way around it starts from at the end it starts from the from the branches it starts from the tip of the branch actually and then the further depending on how what you collected to build the tree so depending on the branches depending on what's on the tip of the branch and i will explain what i mean the roots will be determined by what is really sitting on the tip of the branch of the tree so we could study the leaves of the tree by looking at what we have today and then start to reverse engineer start to move back in time to try to understand what the rest of the tree what the roots of the tree look like exactly so the tree itself by just taking a few steps back and looking at the entire tree itself can give you an idea about the connectedness the relatedness of the organisms or whatever again you use to create your tree there are different ways but in this case i'm imagining entire diversity of life today is sitting on the tips of the branches of this tree and we look at biologists look at the the tree itself we like to think of it as the topology of the tree to understand when certain organisms or their ancestry may have merged over time and depending on the tools you use you might use this tree to then reconstruct the ancestors as well and so what are the different ways to do the reconstruction so you can do that at the gene level or you could do it at the higher complex biology level right so what what in which way have you approached this this fascinating problem we approached it in every way we can so it's the gene could be protein the product of the gene or species or could be even groups of species it will depend it totally depends on what you want to do with your tree if you wanna understand certain past events whether an organism exchanged a certain dna with another one along the course of evolution you can build your tree accordingly if you rather use the tree to reconstruct or resurrect ancient dna which is what we do then in our case for instance we do both gene protein and species because we want to compare the tree that we create using these different information k well let me ask you the ridiculous question then so how realistic is jurassic park can we study the genes of ancient organisms and can we bring the those ancient organisms back so the reason i asked that kind of ridiculous sounding question is maybe gives us context of what we can and can't do by looking back in time yeah so dinosaurs or all these mammals in in at least for us is the exciting thing already happened by the time we hit to the larger organisms or to eukaryotes oh to you the fun stuff is before we got to the mammals the fun stuff is what people think is boring i think the the the the phase that's well at least two different times in the geologic history one is the first life past origin of life how did first life look like and the second is why do we think that over certain periods of geologic time no significant innovation happened to the degree of leaving no record behind so what do we not have a record of which part which part so you say you the fun stuff to you is after the origin of life which we'll talk about after the origin of life there's single cell organisms the the whole thing with the photosynthesis the whole thing with the eukaryotes and multicellular organisms and what what else is the fun stuff the whole oxygen thing which mixes in with the origin of life there's a bunch of different inventions all they have to do with is primitive kind of looking organisms that we don't have a good record of so i will tell you the more interesting things for us one is the origin of life or what happened right following the emergence of life how did the first cells look like and then pretty much anything that we think shaped the environment and were was shaped by the environment in a way that impacted the entire planet that enabled you and i to have this conversation we have very little understanding of the biological innovations that took place in the past of this planet we work with a very limited set of i don't wanna even say data because they're fossil records so let's say imprints either that comes from the rock and the rock record itself or what i just described these trees that we create and whatever we can infer about the past so we have two distinct ways that comes from geology and biology and they each have their limitations okay so right so there's an interplay with the the geology gives you that little bit of data and then the biology gives you that little bit of kinda constraints in the materials you get to work with to infer how does this result in the kind of data that we're seeing and now we can have this through the fog we can see we can look back hundreds of millions of years a couple of billion years and try to infer even further and and i like that you said fog it is pretty foggy we what we are to do and it gets foggier and foggier to to the more you the further you try to see into the past biology is you you basically study with study the survivors broadly speaking yeah and you're trying to pitch the sort of put together their history based on whatever you can recover today what makes biology fascinating also let it it erased its own history in a way right so you work with this four billion year product that's genome that's the dna it's great it's a very dynamic ever evolving chemical thing and so you will get some information but you're not gonna get much unless you know where to look because it is responding to the environment yeah so what we have it's fascinating what we have is the survivors the successful the successful organisms even the primitive ones even the the bacteria we have today so bacteria is not primitive and we sorry sorry to offend the bacteria it's we should be very grateful to bacteria first of all they are our great great ancestors mhmm i like this quote by douglas adams humans don't like their ancestors they rarely invite them over for dinner yeah right but bacteria is in your dinner bacteria is in your gut bacteria is helping you so we do invite them for dinner we might have well they'd get themselves invited in a way yes and so we and they're definitely older and and definitely very sophisticated very resilient than anything else as someone working at the as a as a bacteriologist i feel like i need to defend them in this case because they don't get much shout out mhmm when we think about life so you do study bacteria so which organisms gives you hints that are alive today that give you hints about what ancient organisms were like is it bacteria is it viruses what do you study in the lab we study variety of different bacteria depending on the questions that we ask we engineer bacteria so ideally we wanna work with bacteria that we can engineer seldom we developed the tools to engineer them and it depends on the question that we are interested in if we are interested in connecting the biology and geology to understand the early life and and fundamental innovations across billions of years there are really good candidates like cyanobacteria so we we use cyanobacteria very frequently in the lab we can engineer its genome we can perturb its function by poking its own dna with the foreign dna that we engineer in the lab we work with e coli it's the most simple in in terms of model systems go goes organism that one can study well established sort of a pet lab pet that we use it a lot for cloning and for understanding basic functions of the cell given that it's really well studied so and then what you do with that e coli you said that you inject it with foreign dna we inject pretty much all the bacteria that we work with with foreign dna we also work with diazotrophs these are azodobacteria they're one of the prime nitrogen fixers nitrogen fixing bacteria can you explain what that is nitrogen fixing is that is the source of its energy so nitrogen is a triple bond gas that's pretty abundant in the atmosphere but nitrogen itself cannot be directly utilized by cells given it is triple bond it needs to be converted to ammonia that is then used for the downstream cellular functions and that's what counts as nitrogen fixing yes so nitrogen fixing fixed before our cells can make use of it and and it's no offense to nitrogen either well it's actually a very important element it's one of the most abundant elements on on our on our planet that is used by biology it's in atp it's in chlorophyll that's uses that relies on nitrogen so it's a very important enzyme for a lot of cell functions and there's just one mechanism that evolution invented to convert it it is fix it so far we know there's there's only one nitrogen fixation pathway as opposed to say carbon you can find up to seven or eight different carbon base microbes invented to fix carbon that's not the case for nitrogen it's a it's a singularity across geologic time we think it evolved around two point seven maybe roughly three probably less than three billion year old billion years ago and that's the only way that nature invented to fix the nitrogen in the atmosphere for the subsequent use would we still have life as we know it today if we didn't invent that nitrogen fixing step i cannot think of it no it's it's it's essential to life as we know you you and i are having this conversation because life found a way to fix nitrogen is that one of the tougher ones if you put it sort of oxygen nitrogen carbon what are in terms of being able to work with these elements what is the hardest thing what is the most essential for life just to give context well we we think of this as the cocktail you may hear what what's in the cocktail it's the schnapps right carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen sulfur so there are five elements that life relies on we don't quite know whether that's the only out of many options that life necessarily needs to operate on but that's just how it how it happened on our own planet mhmm and there are many abiotic ways to fix nitrogen and like lightning right lightning can accumulate ammonia humans found a way about a hundred years ago i think around world war one the haber bosch process that we can abioticly convert nitrogen into ammonia actually fifty percent of the nitrogen in our bodies comes from the human conversion of nitrogen to ammonia it's helped it it's the fertilizer that we use urea comes from that process it's it's in our food so we helped we found a way to fix our own nitrogen for ourselves yeah but that you know that's way after the original invention of hydrogen absolutely and without that we wouldn't have we wouldn't have all the steps of evolution along the way oh absolutely it's we tried to replicate in the most simplest way what nature has come up with right we do this by taking nitrogen using a lot of pressure and then generating ammonia life does this in a more sophisticated way relying on one single enzyme called nitrogenase it's the nitrogen that is used together with eight electron donor and atp together with lot of hydrogen life pushes this metabolism down to create fixed nitrogen it's quite remarkable so the lab pet e coli inject them with dna those are the so e coli does nitrogen fixing in part or is that was that a different one so some biological engineers engineered e coli to fix nitrogen i believe not not us we use the nature's nitrogen nitrogen fixing bug and engineer it with the nitrogen fixing metabolism that we resurrected using our computational and phylogenetic tools how complicated are these little organisms what what what are we talking about depends on how we define complication okay so i i could tell that you appreciate and respect the full complexity of even the most seemingly primitive organisms because none of them are primitive okay that said what what kind of what what are we talking about how how what kind of machineries do they have that you're working with when you're injecting them with dna so i will start with one of the most fascinating machineries that we target which is the translation machinery it is a a very unique subsystem of cellular life in comparison to i would say metabolism and we used to you you know when we are thinking about cellular life we think of cell as the basic units or the building block but from a key perspective that's not the case that one may argue that everything that happens inside the cell serves the translation and the translation machinery there's a nice paper that called this that the entire cell is hopelessly addicted to this main informatic computing biological chemical system that it is operating at the heart of the cell which is the translation it is the translation translation from what to what so rna transymes it converts a linear sequence of mrna into a folded later folded protein that's that's when the that's the core processing center for information for life it's has multiple steps it initiates it elongates it's terminates and it recycles it operates discrete bits of information it's itself is like a chemical decoding device and that is incredibly unique for translation that i don't think you will find anywhere else in the cell that does this so even though it's called translation it's really like a factory that reads the schematic and builds a three-dimensional object it's like a printer i would divide it into like actually even four more additional steps or disciplines than what would it take to study it by the way you described it it's a chemical system it's the compounds that make it up are chemicals it's physical it's tracks the energy to make its job to do its job it's informatic what is processed are the bits it's computational the discrete states that the system is placed when the information is being processed that's itself is computational and it's biological it's there's variability and inheritance that come from imperfect replication even and in for imperfect computation so you're man that's so good so from the biology comes the like when you mess up the bugs are the features that's the biology informatics is obvious in the rna that's a set of information there the different steps along the way is actually kind of what the computer does with with bits it's doing computation physical there's a i guess the the like almost like a mechanical process to the whole thing that requires energy and actually you know it's manipulating actual physical objects and chemicals because you're have to ultimately it's all chemistry yeah and it tracks this information so it is almost a mini computer device inside ourselves yeah and that's the oldest computational device of life it's it's likely the key operation system that had to evolve for life to emerge it's more interesting or it's more complicated in interesting ways than the computers we have today i mean everything you said which is really really nice i mean i guess our computers have the informatic and they have the computational but they don't have the chemical the physical or the biology and and the computers don't have don't link information to function right they are not tightly coupled nowhere close to what translation and and or the way translation does it so that's the number one i think difference between the two and yes it's it's informatic and we can discuss this further too or one hundred percent let's please discuss this further which part are we discussing for each one of those are fascinating worlds each each of the five yeah so well we can start with the more i guess the the ones that are more established which is the the chemical aspect of the translation machinery it's the the specific compounds make up the assembly of rna chemists showed this in many different ways we can rip apart the entire machinery we know that at the core of it there's an rna that's that operates not only as an information information system itself or information itself but also as an enzyme and and origin of life chemists make these molecules easily now we know we can manipulate rna we can make even with single pot chemistries we we can create compounds what's a single pot chemistry that's i would say when you add all the recipes that you know that will lead you to the final product this is what or or the molecular left chemist do is they they come up with this pot they throw a bunch of chemicals in and they try to try to they're basically chefs of of a certain kind i'm not sure if that's what they call it but that's how i think of it because it is all combined in a test tube and you know the outcome and and it's it's very mathematical once you know the right environment and the right chemistry that needs to get into this container or this part you know what the outcome is there's no luck there anymore it's a pretty rigid established input output system and it's all chemistry so you actually wear a lot of hats is one of them original life chemist my phd is in chemistry but i don't do origin of life chemistry but you're interested in origin of life yes absolutely so some of your some of your best friends are origin of life chemist just make sure that you have good chemist friends if you're interested in origin of life yeah that's a hundred percent requirement it should be mandatory okay so chemistry so what else about this machinery that we need to know chemically well chemically i think that that's it you have enzymes you have proteins enzymes are doing their thing they they know how to chew energy using atp or gtp they they they know what to do on their in their own way they do their enzymatic thing so it's not just the the ribosome that is at the heart of the translation but there are a lot of different proteins you're looking about a hundred different components that compose this machinery well let me ask kinda maybe it's a ridiculous question but did the chemistry make this machine or did the machine use chemistry to achieve a purpose so like i guess there's a lot of different chemical possibilities on earth is is this translation machinery just like choosing picking and choosing different chemical reactions that it can use to achieve a purpose or did the chemistry basically like there's like a momentum like a constraint to the thing that can only build a certain kind of machinery there's basically is is is chemistry fundamental or is is it just emergent like how important is chemistry to this whole process i guess you cannot have life without chemistry you cannot have any cellular process without chemistry what makes life interesting is that even if the chemistry isn't perfect even if there are accidents along the way if something binds to another chemical in in a way it shouldn't there is resilience within the system that it can maybe not necessarily repair itself when it moves on however imperfect mistakes can be handled that's where the biology comes in comes in but in terms of chemistry you absolutely cannot have a translation machinery without chemistry and so you you as i said there are four main steps these are the core steps that are conserved in all translation machinery and i should say all life has this machine mhmm right every cell and everything on earth on earth yeah yes when you think of this machine do you think very specifically about the kind of machinery that we're talking about or do you think more philosophically a machine that converts information into function it's i i cannot separate the two i think what makes this machinery fascinating is that those five components that i listed are they they coexist so for instance if we let's just talking about the chemistry part we we know the certain rate constant all these proteins that operate in this machinery needs to harbor in order to get the mechanism going right if you are bringing the the information to the translation machinery and you are the initiator of this computation system you need to have you can only afford a certain range of mistakes if you're too fast then the next message cannot be delivered fast if you're too slow then you may stall the process so there is definitely a chemistry constant going on within the machinery again it's it's not perfect far from it but they all have their own margin of error that they can tolerate versus they cannot otherwise they collapse the system collapses so it's like a jazz ensemble the notes of the chemistry but you can be a little off you said jazz it's definitely true it's a party and it's like everybody's invited and and and they need to operate together right and and they and what's really cool about it i think there are many things that are very interesting about this thing but if you take if you remove it from the cell and put it in a cell free environment it works just fine right so you can get cell free translation systems put this translation in a test tube and it is doing its thing it it doesn't need the rest of the cell to translate information of course you need to feed the information at least so far but but because we are far from evolving a translation maybe not so far evolving a translation in the lab or that if a machinery that can process information as it generates it we have not done that yet that's a pretty complicated machinery so it's hard for to for those origin of life chemists to find a pot that generates because it's far more than chemistry you need you need biology obviously you need biochemistry you need to think as a i think a network systems folk you need to think about computation you need to think about information and and that is not happening yet except we are trying to bring this perspective but the more you understand how the information systems work you cannot once you see it you cannot unsee it it's one of those things so but you could still rip it out and the chemistry happens yes and chemistry can happen even with even if you strip some of the parts out it can you can get very minimal level of information processing that does not look anything like the translation that cells relies on but that but chemists showed from linear you can generate information that arrives to a processing center in the form of a linear polymer but the informatic part of this system that i think sets it apart from computation and from metabolism comes in if you think about the information itself right so we have four nucleotide letters that compose dna and they are processed in the translation in triplets so you have in in triplet codon fragments so you have four times four times four so you have sixty four possible states that can be encoded by four letters in three positions mhmm alright so so amazing yeah it's so amazing there is only one code that says start that's the that there's only one and then there's two if not three that says stop so that's that's that's what you work with but you can have sixty four possible states but life only uses twenty amino acids so we use six life uses sixty four possible states minus four of the starts and stops to code for twenty amino acids in different combinations that is really amazing if you think about there there are five hundred different amino acids life can choose right it's narrowed it down to training we don't know why a lot of people think about this genetic code is quite fascinating it's not right i mean it didn't do it for four billion years i don't know we may wait for another four billion years but wait you didn't have those amino acids in the very beginning right like we don't know so it we we would be fooling ourselves if we said we know exactly how many amino acids existed early on but there's no reason to think that it's it's wasn't the same or similar yeah we don't we don't have a good reason but but because roughly twenty out of sixty states are used you're using one third of your possible states in the in your information system so it it this may seem like a waste but informatically it's important because it's abundant and it is redundant right yeah so so it the this code degeneracy you see this in that's implemented by this translation machinery inside the cell so it it means you can make errors right you can make errors but the message will still get through you you can speak missing some letters to the information can miss some parts but the message will still get through so that's two thirds of the not used states give gives you that robustness and resilience within the system so at at the informatic level there's room for error there's probably room for error probably in all five categories that we're talking about there's probably room for error in the computation there's probably room for error in the physical yes exactly everywhere there's room for error because because the this informatic capacity is made possible together with the other components and not only that but also the the product yields a function no in this case enzyme or protein mhmm right so so that's really amazing to me it is i mean i mean in my head just so so you know because i'm a a a computer science ai person the the parallels between even like language models that encode language or now they're able to encode basically any kind of thing including images and actions all of in this kind of way the the the parallel in in in terms of informatic and computation is just incredible actually i have a image maybe i can send you can we pull it up now if you just do genetic codon charts they we can pull that up yeah it's a very standard table so i can i can explain what why this is so amazing so you're looking at like this is life's alphabet right and so i i also wanna make a very quick link now to your first question the tree of life when when we link when we try to understand ancient languages right or the cultures of the the or the cultures that use these extinct languages we start with the modern languages right so we look at indo european languages and and try to understand certain words and make trees to understand you know this this is what slavic word is for snow something like snig now we jump to languages that humans spoke from human history exactly so we make trees to understand what is the original ancestor what did they use to say snow and if you have a lot of cultures who use the word snow you can imagine that it was snowy that's why they needed that word it's the same thing for biology right if if they have some if we understand some function about that enzyme we can understand the environment that they lived in it's it's the similar it's similar in that sense so now you're looking at the alphabet for of life in this case it's not twenty or twenty five letters it's you have four letters so what is really interesting that stands out to me when i look at this on the outer shell you're looking at the twenty amino acids that compose life right the one the methionine that you see that's the start so the start is always the same got it to me that is fascinating that all life starts with the same start there's no other start code so you sent the a g you know a u g to the cell that when that information arrives the translation knows alright i gotta start function is coming mhmm the following this is a chain of information until the stop code arrives which are highlighted in black squares so for people just listening we're looking at a standard rna colored table organized in a wheel there's an outer shell and there's an inner shell all using the four letters that we're talking about and with that we can compose all of the amino acids and there's a start and there's a stop and presumably you put together the the with these letters you walk around the wheel to put together with the words the sentences that make the words the sentences and you again you get one start you get three there are three different ways to stop this one way to start it and for each letter you have multiple options so you say you have a code a the second code can be another a and even if you messed that up you still can't rescue yourself so you can get a for instance i'm looking at the lysine the k you get an a and you get an a and then you get an a that gives you the lysine mhmm right but if if you get an a and if you get an a and i get a g you still get the lysine so there are different combinations so even if there's an error we don't know if these are selected because they were error erroneous and somehow they got locked down we don't know if there's a mechanism behind this to or we we certainly don't know this definitively but this is informatic part of this and notice that the the colors and in some tables too the colors will be coded in a way that's the the type of the nucleotides can be similar chemically but the the point is that you will still end up with the same amino acids or something similar to it even if you mess up the code do we understand the mechanism how natural selection interplays with this resilience to error so which errors result in the same output like the same function and which don't which actually results in a dysfunction or which are we understand to some degree the the how translation and the rest of the cell work together how an error at the translation level this is a really core level can impact entire cell but we understand very little about the evolutionary mechanisms behind the selection of the system it's thought to be as one of the hardest problems in biology and it is still the dark side of biology we even though it is so essential so this is yeah you're looking at the language of life so to speak and how it's can found ways rather to tolerate its own mistakes so the entire phylogenetic tree can be like deconstructed with this wheel of language because all the final letters those are that's the twenty amino acids that's our alphabet yeah they are all brought together with these bits of information right so you when you look at the genes you're looking at those four letters when you look at the proteins you're looking at the twenty amino acids which may be a little easier way to track the information when we create the tree so using this language we can describe all life that's lived on earth i wish one percent it's we are not that good at it yet right so so in theory this is one way to look at life on earth if you're a biologist and you want to understand how life evolved from a molecular perspective this would be the way to do it and and this is what nature narrowed its code down to so when we think of nitrogen when we think of carbon when we think of sulfur it's all in this that the all these nucleotides are built based on those elements and this is fundamentally the informatic perspective on this point that's that's the informatic perspective and it's important to emphasize that this is not engineered by humans mhmm this is this evolved by itself like right humans didn't invent this just because we we're just describing we're trying to find trying to describe the language of life it's it appears to be a highly optimized chemical and information code it it may indicate that a great deal of chemical evolution and and and this may indicate that a lot of selection pressure in darwinian evolution happened with prior to the rise of last universal common ancestor because this is almost a bridge that connects the earliest cells to the last universal common ancestor okay can you describe what the heck you just said so this mechanism evolved before the what common ancestor there is the the last universal common ancestor we talk about the tree when we think about the roots if you ideally included all the living information or all the available information that comes from living organisms on your tree then it on the root of your tree lies the last universal common ancestor luca right why last last universal because the earlier universal it also had trees but they all died off we call it the last because it is sort of the first one that we can track because we cannot we don't know what we cannot track right so one there was one organism that started the whole thing it's more like a i would think of it as more like a population a group of organisms than a single second i tweeted this i wanna know the accuracy of my tweet alright sometimes early in the morning i i tweet very pothead like things i said that we all evolved from one common ancestor that was a single cell organism three point five billion years ago something like this how how true is that tweet do i need to delete it no that's actually correct i mean i i think of course there's a lot to say which is like we we don't know exactly but what to what degree is that the the single organism aspect is that true versus multiple organisms do you want me to be brutally honest yes please this so there's still time this this is how we get like caveats and tweets which is so first of all it's not three point five is still very conservative estimate that's supposed to in which direction i would say it's three point eight is probably safer to say at this point that point just people said it probably way before that if you put an approximately i'll take that i didn't i just love the idea that i was once first of all as a single organism i was once a cell well you're still as you're a group of cells no but i started from a single cell me lex you mean like you versus luca are you relating to luca right now or you as a to my like lex development my own development i started from a single cell it's like yes it like built up a step okay that and then so that's a for single biological organism and then from an evolutionary perspective the luca like i start like my ancestor is a single cell and then here i am sitting half asleep tweeting like i started from a single cell evolved a ton of murder along the way to lead the the the this like brutal search for adaptation through the the three point five point eight billion years so you you defy the code of douglas adams you are proud of your ancestors and you invite them over to dinner and you invite them over to your twitter yeah so and it's amazing that this intelligence to the degree you can call it intelligence emerged to be able to tweet whatever the heck i want yes that means it's amazing it's almost intelligence at the chemical level and this is also probably right one of the first chemically intelligent system that evolved by itself in nature yeah you see you see that translation is an fundamentally like intelligent mechanism in in its own way and and and again the if if we manage to figure out how to drive life's evolution in in it can if it can evolve a sophisticated sort of informatic processing system like this you may ask yourself what might chemical systems be capable of independently doing under different circumstances yeah so like locally they're intelligent locally they don't need the rest of the shebang like they don't need the big picture so that that's that's a great segue into what makes this biological right the the hearts of the cellular act activities are translation you kill translation you kill the cell yes you not only the translation itself you kill the component that initiates it you kill the cell you kill you remove the component that elongates it you kill the cell so there are many different ways to disrupt this machinery they all the part all the parts are important now it it can vary across different organisms we see variation between bacteria versus eukaryotes versus archaea right so it is not the same it's same exact steps but it can get more crowded as we get closer to eukaryotes for instance but you are still computing about twenty amino acids per second right this is this is what you're generating every second that single machinery is doing twenty a second twenty s twenty one for bacteria i believe eight for eukaryotes or nine twenty one a second i mean that's super inefficient or super efficient depending on how you think about it i think it's great i mean i can yeah but it's way slower than a computer could generate social humility i i think if you can show me a computer that does this we are down here well this is the big this includes the five things not just but i could show you a computer that's doing the informatic right like yes you can show me that but you cannot show me the one that has all but now for now i will ask you about probably what alpha fold right i think the more we learn about and this this is why early life and origin is also very fascinating and applicable to many different disciplines there's there's no way you see this the way we just described it unless you think about early life and early geochemistry and earliest emergent systems but going going back to the biological component all of these attributes that we think about life or that we associate with biology stems from translation and as well as metabolism but i see metabolism as a way to keep translation going and translation keeps metabolism going but translation is arguably a bit more sophisticated process for the reasons that i just described so metabolism is a source of energy for this translation process it's a it's a it's a way to process materials and it is inherently dynamic and it is flexible but it is not focused on repetition as translation does so that's the main difference translation is the kind of in a way just it repeats right so you have the metabolism that can synthesize materials creates or benefits from available energy and again it's a dynamic system and then you have computation that it that is inherently repetitive right needs to carry out repetitive processes it and it does the tasks and it it implements an algorithm but it is not dynamic so you see both of those attributes in translation combined it is repetitive and it is dynamic and it also processes this information so they are fundamentally different i don't know if you can get life if you don't find a way to process the information around you in a repetitive dynamic way yeah and somehow that that's what got selected may maybe not selected i don't know if it was accidental but that that's what it seems to be conserved for four billion years that that's what life established what what's the connection between translation and the self replication which seems to be another weird thing that life just started doing wanting to just replicate itself think when we truly understand the answer to that question we may have just made ourselves life right we i don't think we know quite how translation machinery as a whole fits into equation because so we we try to understand ribosomes rna how the linear information is processed or the genetic code why is this code codons not others y twenty not more not less and we are sort of moving towards translation that's that's what we are working on anyway to finally look at the patterns in which this system operates itself and and if you understand that you're really unlocking a very emergent behavior one of the things you didn't mention is physical is there something to mention about that component that's interesting there's actually a paper published in twenty thirteen i wanna say the first author is zirnov so they surveyed a computational engineered systems level computation energy consumption okay and they try to understand whether the universe is using its own or life is using its full capacity of energy consumption and whether if different planets in the universe had life would the capacity would increase or decrease is does life operate at its energy maximum and and they think that it does that it actually operates at an efficiency that is far more above and beyond any computational system how is that possible to determine it all that you tell me that's why i dropped the citation i i found the citation it's quite an interesting paper it's a bit you know it's a in it's a obviously we can only calculate and infer these things but that's a good question to ask is the life that we see here on earth and life elsewhere in the universe is it using the energy most efficiently yeah yeah i it seems to be very efficient again if we compare it to computers it seems to be incredibly efficient at using energy i think they they look at the like the theoretical optimum for electronic devices got it and then try to understand where life falls on on this and life is certainly more efficient and that's ultimately the physical side how well are you using for this entire mechanism the energy available to you and so given given all the resilience to errors and all that kind of stuff it seems that it's close to its maximum yep and this this paper aside it does seem that life obviously that's the constraint we have on earth right is the amount of energy yeah so that's one way to define life well the input is energy and the output is what i don't know self replicating wait how okay let's go there how do you how do you personally define life do you have a do you have a favorite definition that you try to sneak up on is it possible i to define life on earth i don't know it depends on what you are defining it for if you're defining it for finding different life forms then it probably needs to have some quantification in it so that you can use it in in whatever the mission that you're operating to work with binary it's this is like a seven out of ten on life life life life life life list i i don't know i i don't i don't think that defining is that essential i think it's a good exercise but i'm not sure if the if we need to agree a universally defined way of understanding life because the definition itself seems to be ever evolving anyway right we have the nasa's definition it's it's is it has its minuses and pluses but it seems to be doing its job but what what are the different if there is a line and it's impossible or unproductive to define that line nevertheless we know it when we see it is one definition that the supreme court likes and that's a kind of an important thing to to think about when we look about when we look at life on other planets so how do we try to identify if a thing is living when we go to mars when we go to the different moons in our solar system we would go outside our solar system to look for life yeah out of the planets it's unlikely to be a a sort of smoking gun event right it's not gonna be hey i found this you don't think so i don't think so unless you find an elephant on some exoplanet then i can say yeah that's there's life here no but isn't there a dynamic nature to the thing like it moves it has a membrane that looks like there's stuff inside it doesn't need to move right i mean like look at plants i mean they they grow but there are plants that's or can be also pretty dormant and arguably they are most they do everything that one of my favorite professors once said that the plant does everything that a giraffe does without moving so movement is not a zen statement necessarily but on a certain time scale the the plant does move it just moves slower yes it moves pretty i would i would say that completely on a time and i'm i'm it's hard to quantify this or even measure it but it is a life is definitely chemistry finding solutions right so it is chemistry exploring itself and and maintaining this exploration for billions of years so okay so a planet is a bunch of chemistry and then you run it and say alright figure out what what cool stuff you can come up with that's essentially what life is given a chemistry what is the cool stuff i can come up with if if that chemistry or the solutions that it embarks upon are maintained in a form of memory right so it it's the it's you you don't just need to have the explore exploring chemical space but you need to also maintain a memory of some of those solutions for over long periods of time so that's the memory component makes it more living to me because chemistry can always sample right so chemistry is chemistry but are you just constantly sampling or are you building on your former solutions and then maintaining a memory of those solutions over billions of years or at least that's what happened here chemistry can't build life if it's always living in the moment the physicist will be very upset with you okay so memory could be a fundamental i mean life is not just life i mean life is obviously chemistry and physics leading to biology so this is not a disciplinary problem of one discipline triumphing other discipline it's the but what what you need to have is definitely i mean chemistry is everywhere right i tend to think you can be a chemist you can study chemistry you can study physics you can study geology anywhere in the universe but this is the only place you can study biology this is the only place to be a biologist that's it yeah so so definitely something very fundamental happened here and you cannot take biology out of the equation if you wanna understand how that vast chemistry space how that general sequence space got narrowed down to what was what is available or what is used by life you need to understand the rules of selection and that's when evolution and biology comes into play so the the rules of natural selection operate to you on the level of biology rules i don't know if there are any rules like that it would be fascinating to find in terms of the biology's rules that that's a very interesting and it's a very fascinating area of study now and probably we will hear more about that decades to come but if you wanna go from the the broad to specific you need to understand the rules of selection and that is gonna come from understanding biology yes well actually let me ask you about selection you have a paper on evolutionary stalling where you describe that evolution is not good at multitasking or like in populations that evolve quickly i mean it's a very specific thing but there could be a generalizable fundamental thing to this that evolution is not able to improve multiple modules simultaneously i guess the question is what part of the organism does evolution quote unquote focus on to improve yeah that was the driving question we meddled with the part where you shouldn't be messing up with translation this is the should or should not you shouldn't as i said there are many ways to break it and all life needs it so one of the thing your favorite things to do is to break life see what happens it's yeah because that's how kids learn right so you have to break something and then see how it will then you do it over and over again to see if it will fix itself in the same ways yeah so that's it's our i don't know it's the most fundamental properties of our ourselves as human beings so so if we shouldn't break translation then we should try to break it yes to see how it will repair so which part did you break i broke elongation so what what's what's the role of elongation in this process so the we we have four steps of the of the transitions initiate elongate so to elongate the chain of the the information chain that you're now creating the peptide chain or let's say broadly polymer chain and there's a termination step and there's the recycling so all of these steps are carried out by proteins that are also named after these steps initiation is the initiation factor protein elongation is the elongated protein we broke elongation so the cell the starting codon could still arrive to where it's supposed to go but the following information couldn't get carried out because we replaced elongation with its own ancestral version so we inserted roughly a seven hundred million year old elongation factor protein after removing the modern gene so we made this ancient modern hybrid organism and that essentially creates in some way the ancient version of that organism i wouldn't say so it's the it's a it's a hybrid organism it's not because you the rest of this cell the rest of the genome is still modern mhmm and that goes back to the difference between jurassic park there are many differences obviously given that this is not fiction we are doing it but also we are not necessarily i think in jurassic park they are taking an ancient or they find an ancient organism and then put in modern gene inside the ancient organism in our case we are still working with what we got but putting an ancestral dna inside the modern organism so you're like taking a new car and putting a old engine into it in a way yeah yes and seeing what happens yes in but in our case the it's more like a transformer than just a regular car it is doing things it's yeah so it's a more complicated organism than just a car okay i got it so what does that what does that teach you we we wanted to understand multiple things one is the how does the cell respond to perturbation and we didn't just put the ancient dna we inserted we sampled dna from currently existing organisms so the cousins of this microbe and and collected dna sequences from the cousins as well so both ancestor and the current cousin dna so to speak and engineered all of these things to the modern bacteria and generated a collection of microbes that either have the ancient component or the variant elongator component that still alive today but coming from a different part of the tree so you broke elongation was that something you did as part of the paper on evolutionary stalling to try to figure out how evolution figures out what to try to improve did that help yes be because we were not supposed to mess with the translation that's exactly what we did and we altered elongation by changing it with different versions of elongation that are either coming from species that still are around today you can imagine them as sitting on the tips of the tree near branch far branch to compare to the organism that we're working with cousins distant cousins as well as the ancestors of the bacteria that's we are now modifying how much different variation is there in that elongation step like what what are the different flavors of elongation that's a very good question so mechanistically or mechanically it's the same it's it's very conserved so all life elongates the same way you are it's nothing but a shuttle you just carry an chemical with you the the bit to the heart of the machine is it essentially doing like a copy paste operation it has its tail that's attached to the the code which is then carried biochemically to the linear chain to the core of ribosome and the and it sits on there it's released and the peptides click the the coats rather click once that chemistry that is at the tail end occurs the protein leaves the center so it you can imagine it's like it hops in there and hops out mhmm and when it hops and hops out it leaves the information behind that's all it does it's bring the information get out of there and it's all triggered by biophysics biochemistry because of the way the enzyme choose energy in this case gtp how the the phosphor leaves the center that kicks that gives the the additional kick to the enzyme to leave the center so what which parts are different then where where's the flavors of different flavors to all the kitchen usually the parts that matter don't change over time nature conserves the sites of these proteins that are important for its job if there's a difference then we we wanna know especially if if there's a difference between two cousins and in we look at the sites that interact with the most important parts of this machinery if we see any difference we tend to mutate or we revert we we engineer that part we alter that part because it gives us a clue that there must be something interesting going on here or not okay so that's not the the fundamental part of the machinery but it's some flavorful characteristic that you can play with so now you stripped the machinery down to its parts and now you are looking at the parts of the parts okay and it depends where you're looking and how you're looking and what you're looking at but usually we see up to seventy percent level conserved identity across all modern versions when you travel back in time the identity decreases so elongation likely existed we have good reason to think that it existed at the dawn of life so you're looking at a three point eight billion year old mechanism and when we look at the ancestors that we resurrect we see about forty percent identity so the identity definitely decreases as you go back in time but still sixty percent shared information over four billion year is is pretty good is that just for elongation or for the entire translation depends on what you do so for initiation we've also recently published this it's a different story but overall you see high level of identity that that is kept intact especially if the component is essential for life okay so forty percent and sixty per seventy percent you said but like from generation to generation how does evolution and presumably that's what that paper is looking at is the parts of the parts yeah how does how does it able to say like mess with the parts and try to come up with a cooler improved version of the organism yeah so let me describe to you what we did in that experiment we took a different we took bacteria we perturbed the elongation in all of these with different variants so we had an initial set of a group of bacteria that we had we then subjected these bacteria to evolution in the lab right so we first of all we knew we broke it because upon engineering we measured what's going on with the cell it's not growing as well they're not healthy we can see it with our eyes we can measure it that if they were generating an offspring every twenty minutes now it is forty minutes right so we really mess them up they don't wanna work with this thing they don't want each other but they need each other so we created that situation for them which is good because we want to see how we wanted to see how they will cooperate with each other to fix this problem because we know that that's not the condition that they wanna live in especially when they know what they can do so with that we subjected these organisms to evolution in the lab that's we refer to this as experimental evolution we subject bacteria to different selection pressure project them through bottlenecks every day we randomly collect a handful of bacteria from the flask give them put them in a new fresh environment with fresh food keep them in this environment for twenty four hours until they reach a more dormant state and then we subject introduce them to a new environment so we repeated this for about it i will say a hundred and fifty days so every day not nonstop we repeated this experiment some kind of how much how many different kinds of environments are there we we kept the environments into the same because we had different initial conditions we kept the environment constant same temperature same food same source of carbon but we created replicates for each lineage so in some ways we created our own fossil record in the lab by evolving and generating these flasks and every gen every step of the way we also froze these cells and took stacks of them in the in the cryo freezer how long does it take to go from one generation to the next with bacteria if you for e coli it's usually twenty minutes okay great so that's the experiment that's the experiment and and you're you're always messing it with it in the same way for the initial it's the it's the same way so we we introduce variation at the elongation level because so because we perturbed it with different elongations we found that if we introduce a different protein that is very different the cells don't like that right so if the distance is larger the consequence is also large meaning that you hit them harder if you introduce a variant that is really foreign to them that's really distant in in our case it was the ancestor they really did not like the ancestor but they were okay with their nearest cousin right okay great so you did vary in the distance we varied at the this evolutionary distance and then we kept the experimental conditions the same and we propagated these populations every day for a hundred and fifty days and we collected bacteria at every step of the way and looked at the sequence we wanted to understand what sort of changes may have happened in the genome to respond to the variation that we've introduced so what kind of changes are you would you be seeing depending on the evolution distance of the thing you shoved into it exactly so we knew where we punched right we punched right the heart right we punched the translation so we we expected is it gonna be is it translation are we gonna see a change will translation respond to this by fixing itself right away mhmm or will it be another outside of translation something completely different a different module because translation itself is a module or will it be within elongation a really sub protein level thing so we had a strategy to identify the mutational pathways by categorizing what we expected to find or where okay so why does it not do multitasking why is it not improving multiple things simultaneously it turned out that what we observed in general is that first of all the harder we hit the cells the more likely they were to respond by changes right at where we hit it when you say hit it you mean like change the something about the feeling of it as hitting because we are i like to think this is breaking the cells right i mean not breaking enough to kill it but we still because they're still alive they're not doing their job well so the the the bigger the evolutionary distance of the thing you put in there the the the the harder the hit is how you think about it the bigger the hammer bigger the hammer exactly you hit it with okay it that's what it turned out to be because that's what the data told us that if we if the variation is higher then the consequences will also be higher in the sense that the cells will not grow as healthy compared to a a variant that is coming from a near or a variant that is coming from a near evolutionary instance is it is it wrong to think of this kind of hitting as it came to a mutation or no what are we supposed to learn from this hitting like how how the thing evolves after it's it's being hit in this way what does that teach us because we we'd see translation machinery as almost it is so conserved and so essential it is not even clear whether we can remove some of the parts or whether the entire translation will need all of the same parts in the same efficiency mhmm we don't understand the rules of this machinery so the first thing we all understand is that how what is the resilience what are we really talking about here when we talk about you cannot mess with this translation is this true because it is so conserved and so similar and functions in the most conserved ways that was the first thing that we want to understand did you learn anything interesting about the resilience at the chemical physical informatic computational no i i wouldn't say that i think the biological level yes because we found that the different modules started responding to the changes that we've introduced and that we could never recover the translation as effectively as it used to be so that it never reached to it is optimality that it was always suboptimal it it didn't say one more mutation perhaps to get there it accumulated four mutations that was we did a lot of experiments to understand this of course it was accumulating mutations it was getting better at its task maybe it needed couple other mutations to get really good at it but somehow those mutations never happened and before those mutations happened we saw another module emerging through mutations and getting better at its own different task that is not translation you can think of cell as a web of networks right when we think of this as multiple almost airports that are proteins that are more central hubs versus their proteins that maybe are not as important hub if you introduce a problem in the most populated hub you're gonna mess up the traffic system more drastically and and that's what we were messing with in in the biological terms as well so when we say module like translation would be one of the modules translation would be one so you're basically saying when you mess with translation the organism would choose to either try to fix that module or another module depending exactly but it wouldn't do multiple modules it wouldn't do multiple modules it focused on one module at a time and right before that module maybe reached to its own maximum it stalled its optimality at a certain degree so you never get to an degree that is more optimal than you can achieve even though perhaps another mutation could get you there since you messed with the translation from a sort of optimal perspective wouldn't make sense for the cell to try to start fixing the translation not that's exactly what we thought and it didn't it was not the case for all the broken translation missionaries for instance if the variant was coming from a near ancestor that didn't happen it was almost cruising around trying different modules and sort of living its best life still without because there's no real urgency in the system to fix the most important problem there also not a direction you know maybe to you it's obvious that's the problem but to the cell maybe you're the problem i'm living like you said my best life like we don't i mean i guess that's the thing about evolution is we don't know what the right direction to yeah it's almost like that you can imagine that you have this messy closet and you know you can go on happens to be an accurate representation and of my life so you can't you you take a look at it and you see all the sweaters or you know yeah jeans are all over the place and then you look at a drawer that's has socks coming out of it and you think that's the most important one i'm just gonna fix that one and then you fix that one and then you think you will get to the other one but you don't because you just fix the most important one that is the whatever that was getting into your way that's really what evolution is it's quite lazy it fixes the problem that seems to be the most immediate and it doesn't go beyond what it really needs to it seems like at least for our experimental setup that was the case especially for rapidly evolving systems so like i or is the environment they're operating in pretty constrained like is there a urgency i would i would i would say that we definitely constrain the environment it's definitely removed from their natural setup we are not evolving them in a gut it's a very homogeneous system very controlled controlled temperature controlled food controlled carbon so just looking at that let me ask the the romantic question how did evolution create so much beautiful complex variety on earth like from that you're saying that we're talking about improving different modules but if we step back and look at the entirety of the tree the different organisms that created all throughout history the the stuff that's fun to you with the the the first few billion and the the stuff that's fun to me when i watch on youtube which is like the the line versus gorilla fights and so on but the whole thing is fun so with all that beautiful variety from the predator and the prey from the self replicating bacteria and all that kind of stuff how did it do it how is a very difficult question especially when we don't understand the past with clarity at all i can tell you that there seems to be very critical innovations that happened throughout the history of life that are each themselves very sophisticated singularities that emerged once and then they set the tone one of which is emergence of translation it's seems like it happened once it had to happen once seems like that's all it took three point eight billion year maybe older clearly subjected to a lot of chemical evolution even prior to last universal common ancestor and then you jump and you see emergence of cyanobacteria that's undeniably changed the course of this planet in the subsequent aerobic photosynthesis that life learned how to utilize what's available in the environment in the most profound way and then you move forward you see the emergence of eukaryotes that is endosymbiosis also another singular event and then you move forward and then comes the plants so these are i counted i think six different things that seems to have happened just once and the singularity events in the history of evolution of life on earth so what's really fascinating here is that there seems to be two different courses the time course evolution or it the is operating at the molecular level right we're talking about seconds we're talking about mutations that happen every second we're talking about selection that's also happening under a minute right so that is a very fast process the fact that i can evolve bacteria in a lab and i say almost complaining me oh my goodness it took me a hundred and fifty days i mean that's pretty rapid to for for a change to be seen but then the big changes and the ones that i'm talking the really big innovations that increased that caused an increase of oxygen on this planet or even its own mere presence are due to these molecular innovations seems to only happen a handful of times over billions of years of time scale let me ask you this question having to do with my half asleep tweet so saying that we all originated from one common ancestor that's just one of the miraculous things about life on earth of course you could say there's multiple common ancestors in the beginning multiple organisms and so on but the other stuff that you're talking about is is these singular events these leaps of invention throughout evolution in history now there's a bunch of people who were commenting a bit surprising to me who were basically skeptical of this idea the idea of well i would say evolution honestly the process of evolution but when you just actually focus in i'm like holy crap eukaryotes were invented holy crap photosynthesis were invented like those are incredible inventions and also if we can go to homo sapiens like intelligence like where did that come from it's there's these mysteries i think where that skeptical comments are coming from were also just a general skepticism of science i think from the pandemic people maybe a failure of institutions and so on there's been a growing distrust of science and it's not so so much that it's anti evolution it's it's more of a stepping back and saying wait a minute maybe scientists don't have it all figured out and i think to steelman that case is almost a step back and to realize there's so much mystery to each of these leaps so it makes you wonder is there something that in a hundred two hundred years we'll figure out that we totally don't understand yet like some you know there's i i talked to a bunch of people about another mystery which is consciousness right and there's people called panpsychists who believe consciousness is one of the fundamental laws of the universe so there could be you know like we have laws of physics that could be something that's like a consciousness field or something that permeates all matter and so like there might be it's kinda like newtonian physics versus general relativity like we have a good understanding of how things happen but we need another layer of understanding to fill in the gaps of the mysteries of it all and that sort of is a sobering reality that maybe there is something we really deeply don't understand do you have a sense of where the biggest mysteries here are is it the origin of life itself is it the leaps that we're talking about so you you see the beauty you're fascinated about the translation mechanism what what are the deep mysteries there to you we are nothing but chemical systems capable of formulating or answering questions about our own existence right we humans or all of life you think humans humans are i mean the fact that we can we even have this conversation about our place in the universe is is at least to our knowledge is quite specific to our own chemical species but yeah it's kinda wild we're we're we're introspecting on our evolutionary history and we're just a couple of organisms yes and with like another organism listening to this and like they're mind blown there's like three organisms two of them talking and the third one's like holy shit i think that understanding the what i really find interesting about understanding origin of life or or even contemplating about our own place in the universe if at the end of this would come down to appreciating or even before appreciating really truly comprehending what it is that we got here that to me is a huge gain because there's no single question in biology i think that will give that the that would deliver the that magnitude of that message and understanding but understanding how life here started at first place if if we truly comprehend that we this is not a concept that is well thought in schools we ask students to memorize these concepts may if they are lucky they learned rna world chicken and egg problem etcetera that's the extent to which that got maybe their biology teacher was personally interested in the subject matter if they're lucky you know the saying that the the brain brains are evenly distributed across any metric you can imagine but opportunities are not so if pea people aren't understanding the importance of this is because that's a lack of opportunity right there that's was skipped through the proper education and training then the delivery of why science matters or how science actually works but how do you even begin to seriously think about the origin of life i mean every problem of existence of life has its time so i don't know if it's time to understand consciousness yet we might be a hundred years away from that the origin of life i don't know if it's time for us to understand that yet maybe we need to solve so many more problems along the way and so it's not a competition of problems right so there there are all kinds of problems and it takes a lot of people to make the world so you will always have some interesting brain going after an interesting problem to their own the issue here is that we we need to first of all understand that we what we have going on on this planet is pretty good good planets are hard to find if we are alone in the universe that's that's huge we need to take care of what we got here and we are incredibly vulnerable to the changes that our own species also helped create on at the biosphere at the ecosystem level we take it for granted we we take what we created for granted because of the fact that we think we are some sort of ultimate endpoint the most sophisticated amazing thing that nature could generate i think understanding not even us understanding but asking these questions of where did this even come from how did this it even begin and attempting to understand that using chemistry and physics and biology and because we can that's the ultimate gift we can give back to the entire species on this planet yeah i mean it's humbling it's humbling to realize the the complexity of this whole mechanism it certainly puts humans in their proper perspective that we're not just because we have brains and brains are intelligent doesn't mean we're the most intelligent thing because ultimately the the whole mechanism of nature seems to be orders of magnitude more intelligent all all of it like we're we're a bunch we're like a hierarchy of organisms that have a history of several billion years and that all somehow came together to make a human and there'll be life after us just as was life before us and something that comes after will be perhaps even more fascinating yeah i think when you understand the magnitude of what happened here there is there is no room for arrogance it should overwhelm you and humiliate it's pretty humiliating yeah you know it's it's it's quite amazing what what what was what happened here and there is no other discipline that will deliver that but exploring our own origins and looking at life as a more planetary system phenomena rather than one single species at a time a collective look you mentioned this question in your ted talk is the two possibilities of the universe being full of life and the universe being empty and we're the only life in the universe how do you feel about both options just actually you as a single chemical organism introspecting about its existence in this world it's having a planet full of life is interesting because there are we talked about life being all about chemistry exploring solutions mhmm and having solutions in front of you is is is great it's beneficial right solutions being different organisms like other humans you see them as a solutions to a chemistry problem different different yeah oh that's an interesting solution that's not next time we're in austin so there's a bunch of weirdos every time i see a weirdo i'll be like oh that's an interesting solution to this chemistry problem now you're thinking like an origin of life science but it's it's funny that that one worked out let's see where else it goes but having this emptiness and the unpredictability of uncovering a novel solution can also have its own benefits and and we should be open to what other solutions might be out there and and exploring those solutions or to different chemistry problems so that's where you see you see the other planets out there as different chemistry problems to their own local environment yes so how many chemistry problems have solutions that are lifelike to you out there in the universe it's a wide open palette if you think about it i don't quite know it's the we know the the chemistry is chemistry i don't think the chemistry will be different elsewhere but again what is selected by chemistry will be determined by the environment most likely see i think there is life everywhere out there so there's a guy named nick lane whose gut and it's interesting to me i wonder what you think about it is his gut is there's life everywhere out there but it stops at like the bacteria stage so he says the eukaryotes is like the biggest invention and the hardest one i wonder if he thinks that's an accidental outcome if he thinks that's inevitable i wonder what that means but it's it's very it's a likely possibility that the bacterial or microbial life is definitely more attainable so that that's a weird world where our entire galaxy just has bacteria everywhere so you know if you don't like microbes you are on on the wrong planet no i know yeah like and viruses i don't know which one there's more of but they're they're both and most of them are like productive they're fascinating they they do everything for us i feel like microscopy on the wrong planet you're full of good lines okay right right i just can't there's like an imperative to the whole thing to me the the origin is the hard question but once it gets going i just don't see the wait mhmm go ahead it seems like it's constantly creating more intelligent things more fascinating complex things they're able to solve from a pocket of problems interesting like that's i i definitely agree that the initial steps may be the ultimate determinants that once it's it's you you cannot stop it once it starts it's possible right and i have never unearthed maybe it's but maybe i just whenever i see life it seems to flourish everywhere it the thing is i don't the the only thing i haven't seen is the start of it exactly but that and how are we gonna understand that if we don't do origin of life science i mean the that's the and and the the question here isn't exactly our ability to recapitulate everything that happened in the exact way that it happened right this is about what can happen rather than and or maybe how you you think it is possible to study the origin of language using english so like there's a very particular chemistry here there's a particular set of assumptions understanding about what life is what everything is our perception of reality is very specific lee constructed through the evolutionary process i wonder if it's possible to get some first principles deep understanding of how life originates in such a way that you can actually construct it on other planets i ultimately it it feels like if you're doing it in a lab on earth you're always going to be using some aspect of the life that's already here so that's what i sort of talked about in my talk as well and everyone should go watch the ted talks very good the the annoying thing to me about ted talks i guess is by design is they're too short it's like come on and and did you know that it there's no prompter involved there's no wait there is or there isn't yeah do you have to memorize stuff you're yeah it's and it's thanks to my guys amazing editor who probably is watching this too david biello that it was very very helpful but i would say that professional organization i like this podcast it's a very professional organization i i i respect that medium yeah anyway the in the in the talk about yeah life life creating life so it's a likely scenario that once we understand how life as a chemical system is is capable of formulating its own expression and generating a memory and manages its existence on a planetary body for billions of years once we understand what conditions gave rise to that we may be very likely to understand whether a different planet also be likely to instigate its own chemical revolution if it were it was provided by through some missing ingredients you can think of it as a sending fertilizer to a different planet that is missing its own chemical composition or lacking or that it needs more of what it has the difference between making that planet earth like which was this is this is not what that's about we're not talking about terraforming or we're not talking about turning that planet into earth like system we are talking about first understanding that planet studying its chemistry studying its its properties well enough to understand whether it is close to its own chemical revolution and maybe giving it that extra notch so this is obviously a pretty big speculation and suggestion and it's co it's very interesting proposition because this is a yes or no question right this is this is the ultimate would you rather it's it's the and i think it says a lot about the perception of the person who's answering this question that if the answer is no no no absolutely not that's not something we wanna do i wanna know why that is the case so just to be clear what we're talking about is looking at the chemical cocktail of a particular planet yes and having like tasting it and seeing seeing what's missing so having a very systematic rigorous scientific process understanding what is missing not what is missing in terms of to make it earth like but what is missing in order to be sufficiently have the spark or the capacity of the spark to launch the evolution revolution the evolutionary process exactly so and then the question is do we want to then complete the cocktail the proposition is to also make us think that we will likely have this capacity at some point especially when we understand origin of life better and better right so we we will be asking ourselves this question i guess i wanted to bring this to daylight a little bit because maybe in ten twenty years maybe more so you wanted to ask the ethical question should we basically start life elsewhere on another planet or enable the the chemical the chemical capacity of that planet that it may one day itself get there okay so for me the answer is yes so if you were to try to argue against my yes what would you say why not what's the worst that could happen if we seed another planet with life what are the things we should think about is is your main concern a chemical biological one or is it an ethical one what do you think about well the worst thing that can happen is that it wouldn't work right so that it's not a likely it's not likely that an attempt like this would work that's probably because how do you so you gotta be very you know you have to have an understanding that i don't think we have just yet i see because if it doesn't work then we could try again right to me the worst case the thing i would be worried about is we create life i mean the same stuff i worry about like with plants or is things that might have a conscious experience and then the the dark aspect of life is life is increasingly complex life maybe i'm anthropomorphizing but it seems to have the capacity to suffer and so we're creating something it's like when you have children you put creatures into this world that will suffer can suffer and may suffer depending on how you view life may likely suffer and so now you carry this responsibility for doing your best to alleviate any suffering they might go through and that that perhaps that's romanticizing this notion of life perhaps bacteria are not capable of suffering but perhaps it'll create more complex life forms that would be able to suffer and that feels like a responsibility as well of course other people would be concerned the more obvious concern is like well you just created a life form how do you know it's not gonna be a super deadly virus that somehow is able to hurt humans yeah my my concern is more i feel like that's a solvable problem the problem of creating conscious beings that are able to suffer that's a tricky one yeah i can see why because it goes back to again do would we first of all do we have a responsibility to propagate more of this chemistry that we have on this planet elsewhere given that we know ultimately we will be vanished by we i mean entire planet and if this is in fact a very rare chemical event that happens because all the right circumstances came together and we were the lucky one do we have a responsibility to sponsor it this is a if if we were to back up sponsor i like it it's a good way to put it yeah if we try to back up remnants of our civilization right so we gotta potentially create conditions on the different planets so that humans can survive given that we know that we want to just just for the sake of growing yeah propagating what becoming a multiplanetary species exactly but what really is at stake here i think is actually or what is really more interesting is what we don't see which is the again that the chemical behavior that enabled everything at first place that's different than sending potato crops or engineering bacteria to live on different planet that's very different you're really stripping it down to what is what what is possible at the chemical level so even if you are instigating the con chemistry on different planets you are letting that very planet to do its thing mhmm you're not necessarily contaminating this planet with different chemistry because the idea behind this at least the way i would i i thought about is that you understand that planet you understand the conditions you understand the chemistry of the planet really well before choosing the planet as a candidate at first place and then it's not about sending a missing ingredient per se but again just sending more of what it already has this that would be respecting that planet's condition too so i'm not suggesting any occupation i'm not suggesting any colonization i'm not suggesting any like let's just strip everything and make everything earth like that's not what i'm saying it's more about empowering that place what you are saying is is likely to be the the motivator behind all this let's not because i see suffering i see pain it's it's very interesting i think this is a question that really reveals about a lot about the person who's answering it well okay so the pushback on my pushback if i so am deeply troubled by suffering then i should be probably paralyzed about the history of life on earth and you know there's when you can you elaborate what do you mean most of life who's ever lived suffered in ways that are almost unimaginable to me you mean like your our own species our own species and before and animals living today and we're not even talking about factory farms we're just animals living in extreme poverty in the jungle you don't people think like in the natural environment animals live in a happy place no it's a brutal place of desperately trying to survive of desperately trying to look for food yeah and it's just like all of that life that's just mammals and we understand mammals but like throughout like trillions of organisms that led up to those mammals and the organisms living everywhere like even bacteria there's death everywhere so maybe this idea of death this idea of suffering is actually this thing that we see as a bug is actually a feature i don't think suffering is a linear property like that with life and i may be with nick lane on this one that the likeliness of anything similar to what we got here evolving in another planetary body i think is quite low where where would you say is the the biggest unlikely thing do you mean humans or do you mean even multicellular organisms probably multicellular multicellularity it's but i i understand both sides of the equation right in in one level i can see that we may not have any other choice but to back up this chemistry somewhere else yeah so you would be saving it's the ultimate save saving or the record our our own record it's not about you know yes let's also save beatles and all amazing songs but this would be the ultimate repository of life but it is i can also see your point of view for sure it's really interesting so like don't see the plan with a missing ingredient try to understand with the ingredients it has is it possible to construct life for me for for a from a computer person it just feels like something that could be solved computationally we can learn from the mistakes that we've done here and aspire not to repeat them it is possible we we do amazing things as humans there's a lot of suffering but there's also a lot of beauty and and we we could choose what we want to be or what we want to see right so the the the these attempts don't need not to come from need not to come from a place of fear but it can be ultimately it can come from a piece of hope and love i think we're just very recently figuring out stuff like we've even just a century ago we're doing atrocities that weren't seen as atrocities at the time i mean i think we're learning very quickly of what is right and wrong yes and i work with a lot of maybe because i'm at the university i get to teach young people every day even at the time of four year or three few years you see generational difference already in unfolding in front of you and maybe that's why i see hope because i think what we get to interact with in classrooms every year is just getting better they are aware of issues in a way that i sure wasn't at their age in some levels i was but in many levels i didn't think about i i wasn't concerned of of the problems well they maybe have to be concerned because it's hitting the reality he's hitting them hard but younger people are not afraid of these things an eighteen year old can face these brutal facts about the planet in ways that i don't think any other generation before them did yeah it's super cool and and like the you know there's all these cool technologies that aid in the process of a a human being being able to see the truth at deeper deeper levels like you know wikipedia and just the internet in general is enabling education at a level that was unimaginable before the internet yes and i think space exploration even contemplating about these possibilities ultimately and i will emphasize this again should make us think about our own place in the universe if we are alone that is quite fascinating and we definitely have a responsibility to guard what we got better and protect it better and don't take it for granted if we are not the only one that's also a lot of responsibility to understand what else is out there so either proposition is famously being told it's fascinating but as a as a scientist i think and i think that's a general behavior maybe not my fellow scientists listening to this can correct me if they aren't like this but you need to have a level of optimism and and hope it that's something you know that things are worth working for worth dreaming worth imagining and we cannot just have fear of suffering or fear of pain stopping us from doing marvelous things i've talked to quite a few people in my life who've who've gotten a lot of shit done have helped a lot of people and i don't know a single one of them who's not an optimist now there's a place for critics and cynicism in this world but in terms of actually building things and creating things in this world that help a lot of people i think optimism is a is is a requirement is a precondition in almost all cases in my limited humble human experience but i tend to when i look out there think that aliens are everywhere i think there's to me i have a humility about i tend to see us humans as being very limited cognitively like there's so many things we don't understand i think eventually we'll understand of course we don't know this but my gut says we'll understand that alien signals and life has been all around us and we're too dumb to see it like whatever life is whatever the life force is whatever consciousness is whatever intelligence whatever the the mechanism that led to the origin of life on earth was everywhere and we were just too dumb to see it it's in the physics it's somewhere we'll find it somewhere in the physics i think the that's one of the most it's humbling parts of also being a scientist that we know that we never know for sure and for the outsiders perhaps that may be a very strange way of living especially when your pursue is about creating knowledge and that you'll know that what you created can also be and hopefully will be disproven so that another level will rise and i think we've seen that the this lack of maybe connection between the approach to science or knowledge versus folks who are maybe not thinking about these problems every day that we are okay with being wrong that's in fact we know that that's the only way to push the limits of knowledge how do you think life originated on earth we've talked about this a bit do you have do you have a gut feeling about first of all actually even to step back do you think because you were like flirting with this idea is did the translation mechanism came before life i think that you cannot separate from translation emergence of translation machinery from emergence of life or something like translation machinery this whole informatic chemical computing system that is also capable of dynamism and evolvability that comes with biology biological behavior from emergence of life itself we definitely took a lot of steps towards understanding origins we are able to create molecules from right environments lightning heat and you make amino acids so we we are able to create the building blocks the miller urey experiment that's now sixty years ago we are able to create the building blocks we are able to make them interact with one another they can get more complex some call this messy there's all this chemistry that's going on we are able to have these chemicals interact with one another maybe have even some emergent properties that we can quantify definitely there is this trend towards more systems level approach to origins with more introduction of systems level chemistry more network level chemistry and complex system integration in order to understand how now that we can make these building blocks we can make them interact with one another but how do we make them interact with another in more intelligent ways that will have the properties of a biological system will be heritable it will be responding to the environment it will mutate and it will sustain itself that is the final bit i think in in our origin of life adventure and we are extremely close i i'm very optimistic that our community will get a handle of this problem in in this decade this is in fact i think one of the most exciting times to be doing this work what would be super convincing to you like incredibly amazing would blow your mind if it was done x was done in a lab like what would you i mean i don't know if you would call it origin of life but something really truly remarkable and special done in the lab what would that look like to you the the these properties that i listed these those five properties that i listed about and machinery that is capable of sensing and responding the environment if we can i would imagine similar to miller urey experiments where they only sparked in particular environmental forces and were able to produce a chemical that is important for life or a mix of chemicals important for life or building blocks rather i would if i saw that a similar experiment where an well defined geochemical parameter was subjected on a mix of chemistry which led that chemistry to form some level of computation informatic biological property and by biological i'm gonna keep it to very minimum as i defined early on that would be super exciting to me it's self organizing chemistry that we can create experimentally in a flask by simulating the conditions of early earth be it radiation be it temperature or mix of both that would be very cool and doing all the five the the chemical physical and informatic computation biology yes so like simulation and a computer would not no would not be good enough it would be great because it they help to understand the parameters maybe formulate maybe quantify create models but ultimately you need to experiment unless it's quantum mechanical simulation but that's going to be extremely difficult so simulating from the physics up that's going to be very because you're gonna have to simulate the the physical the chemical the informatic i mean honestly it's it's it's very start to it's very difficult to start the quantum mechanics and end up in biology all through simulation nope but the stuff that deepmind did with alpha fold and protein folding is really inspiring it's it's inspiring in that you're able to do to solve a difficult biology problem absolutely that's that's why there's definitely a lot of benefits to those models predictions because they at least helps the experiment experimentalist to come up with the priors and parameterize things better maybe eliminate very obvious dead ends early on given that experiments take such a long time and it's a huge investment and no one's a better experimentalist than nature so let me let me ask you perhaps a depressing sad for you question really want to make me sad you're not gonna win no i know there's a flame of optimism in you that will never be extinguished okay the idea of pastspermia you mentioned would we seed another planet with life is it possible that our planet was seeded with life from elsewhere so what the the the proposition i made i like to think of it as protospermia rather than panspermia because it's even it's even more it's a more protostate than the acknowledging because in in panspermia you still have a cell right you still have something that is very even a cell to me would be very earth like yep right i'm i'm talking be i'm talking at sub sailor level in in the proposition of spreading chemistry so spreading chemical ingredients not spreading life exactly it it will be more like the fertilizer that is well adopted and and compatible with that planetary body in panspermia you're still imagining either an entire bacteria or microbe or a cell or something that is in dna which is still tearing so in that sense that would that doesn't matter to you because it's it's chemistry that's the initial conditions it doesn't matter how the initial conditions came to be they are what they are and let's go from there yep and there there's all kinds of fascinatingly different initial conditions in terms of chemistry on different planets yes but but the in terms of panspermia i mean obviously that's that there's gonna be always room for that those sort of discussions or there will be those discussions will always be present i think in any life in universe debates but the the problem i have with penn's permian is that it it removes the problem from the planet to somewhere else it makes it very difficult to answer scientifically right you you are just you just took the problem away from this planet and formulate it in a way that i cannot go and try to understand in the lab doing experiments or even through models does it though so i've heard brilliant biologists like yourself say that but i i just to me okay here's how i think of earth so i i actually am able to hold all these possibilities in my head and all of them are inspiring to me i kinda think there's a possibility that earth is just an experiment by a graduate student by an alien graduate student like so i know the exact episodes of star trek you're talking about but the like there is some to me that's inspiring if we are but that's not what's panspermia is about that you're talking about my proposition that's not what panspermia is what's panspermia it is all life just came from elsewhere mhmm still that's interesting because there's still giant leaps that happened on earth it seems like beyond the initial primitive organisms like eukaryotes i don't think panspermia usually articulates at the level of eukaryotes i think they talk about bacteria primarily i think so right mhmm so that that's still interesting because all the different leaps of evolution still happen here on earth that's still interesting yeah but it's i mean it's it's definitely interesting to listen to but i i i wouldn't place it in i i wouldn't know how to place it in the studies of origin of life i guess or or the here's how we place it you have the initial conditions for the origin of life and you try to create life in that way that you've described in the five components then it keeps failing so you what what allows you to do is to also consider the question maybe there's missing components how do you answer that question through exploration and through science yes yeah tell me outside looking outside of earth looking at the fundamentals of chemistry and physics how do you understand that with fundamentals of chemist chemistry and physics how do you understand how do you understand gravity but you're talking about panspermia right just i don't understand how would you it's different than if if you think it's similar to looking for life in the universe is is that what you're thinking no i'm saying there's a missing component that came from elsewhere but a whole entire organism is not a missing component right there right i mean when you're thinking about origin of life no no no that that's an assumption your your assumption is all the ingredients for the origin of life are here on earth now i tend to believe that most likely that's the case i'm just saying it's inspiring to think that there is some ingredients you're gonna push back because that's not past permia that's pros but see okay so think the the the but yeah i'm a it's also kind of fun to push back on you no i i i i understand i understand i understand if if actually a living organism ended up here from elsewhere that means a lot of the exploration we're doing here with the ingredients that we know will not give us the clues to the to the origin of life but it just seems like it's still very useful to try to create life here and then we'll see wait a minute don't you think we'll be able to prove not prove but show that past birth is very likely like if we just keep failing we understand biology deeply we understand chemistry deeply i don't i don't think so i mean there there there will be the failure is is not gonna indicate that this must have been i don't think anyone will put the problem to some some something else just because our failures our experiments failed so failure means we don't understand the chemistry deeply enough yeah and and we given the progress we made and how many brilliant people are working on this right now and it's definitely more i would say that we are approaching this problem in more broader ways different ways possible i'm confident that we will get there for for us again we are interested in early cells and first cells and what followed the origin of life but we cannot given that it's a continuum that's the between the origin and emergence of first cells it's hard to separate these two ends from one another so given that life is a solution to a chemistry problem if we reran earth a million times how different would the results be if we look at that wheel how different would be the the tree of life do you think like what's your gut say my mind asks are you imagining if if you're repeating the planet one million times are we seeing are these things that happened i'm not talking at the chemical level but at the environment level did do they happen at the same time at the same frequency at the same intensity every time you're running this tape over and over again yes you mean like geological stuff yeah like so is this just saying those are important i mean that's that's yep the fact that you would ask that question is also fascinating so that's important the the timing the frequency the intensity of geological events when when we run this imaginary rewind replay experiments in our minds i wanna know whether we are positioning all the same geologic events at the same chronological order as well or whether we are also giving them more randomness so if the volcano erupted this is happening at the same time if if you have a are dinosaurs getting wiped off every time with the same meteorite that's hitting the same but also like temperature changes and all that changes everything that's actually i've heard you say somewhere that one of the things that's fascinating to you about this whole process of evolution is that the the the memory the the process of evolution the all the mechanisms were invented and developed despite all the variation geologically through the hardship that earth has gone through that the the biological innovations persisted despite that yeah despite that which is which is interesting you kinda think of the biological innovations kinda happening in their own because we so we actually have a center exploring this problem we wanna understand whether it's almost like judging a book by its cover right do you just look at an environment and then see whatever is present or scarce in that environment and then think that okay the life form that will exist in this environment will obviously have a lot of molybdenum in its system look at all this molybdenum around here or will it be because if you say that you are now putting the environments in in in the more prime driver role right that you're saying an environment will determine what biology will or will not use but we've done studies that show that it's not necessarily this straightforward that for instance we looked at going back to nitrogen one thing that's fascinating about the way cells fix nitrogen the ones that can do is that they also do this through a lot of help of a lot of metals a lot of elemental support really and which geologists use to understand where did this metabolism even evolve where at first place so we look at ancient oceans we try to understand the elemental composition of ancient oceans and what we see is that in some cases the metabolisms even though they prefer a certain metal or an element that is in the environment that metal wasn't abundant in the environment but still life chose that so it's not that straightforward as though whatever you you are you are what you eat but you don't necessarily eat what is obvious to you and just because there's a lot of that food around it doesn't mean life will ultimately go there maybe most of the time it will but it seems like in the case of nitrogen fixation it didn't and maybe that made the difference it's so cool that right it's not the abundant resource that's going to be the definition of what kind of life flourishes so so it's not it's not a straightforward thing yes but your sense is that the different timing the different conditions of the environment would change the way evolution happens yeah for instance i mean there there i think it's in the eighties maybe earlier than that the stephen jay gold's book wonderful life which changed i think a lot of scientists life including mine he contemplates on this notion of the tape of life of course i hope people still know what tape is but i think your listeners will know what tape is i don't know it's the tape go on tell me about this tape is that is that like a tiktok do can you swipe on it i am sorry go ahead i apologize for my rude interruptions i can't ask for it but he he speculated or suggested this hypothetical experiment whether if life was recorded on or can be imagined to be recorded on a linear is it linear chain of events recorded on a tape and if we were to rewind the state would we listen to the same song right so this was and in his proposition i also thought yeah but are we replaying the tape in the same exact manner or are we meaning all the geological and environmental events are they happening at the same time because then you removed the randomness from equation a little bit right you just removed it because you're assuming everything will happen at the same time at the same intensity so that's not too contingent that means that the natural selection you're thinking is really operating at more or or evolution is operating at more under more random forces then that can be dictated by the environment so in our way of understanding or thinking about rewinding replaying i don't think we're thinking about the role of the environment as clearly or don't seem to be integrated as much but i'll i also wonder if it's possible that the chemistry ultimately defines the destination that despite all the environmental changes despite all the randomness will end will end up in something talking about whether life will emerge and sustain itself we're talking about whether life will emerge and sustain itself in the shape and form that is similar to what we have right now so you are chemistry i'm chemistry we're having this conversation and your plants are chemistry too they're also having their own conversation these plants are fake but yes i knew i didn't wanna say that but they're they're fake but but if you if you look at my place of course they would be fake otherwise they would die what's wrong with this place it's it's wonderful it's it's i'm we're i'm alice and this is wonderland this this is great i this is great it's just that you know there's this is a place where robots flourish and this is that those plants are fake are you saying that you and i are the only living organisms well obviously there are microbes in this room but yeah yeah we are the only living organisms i was thinking of getting a dog well you'd you know you know this is not a clean room so you you have microbes here yes many millions yes so so you and i and all the microbes in this room your chemical systems that are operating in a way that we can respond and sense and our environments and whatnot yeah but in if you are asking if you're gonna be here then you're imagining that another solution is also possible which is different than the fundamentals of life because life will do always life will do its life thing mhmm i guess it goes all the way back to the things we're talking about translation and the stuff you were messing with is figuring out what is the important stuff and what isn't makes me wonder about you know just like with the trans translation machinery with human beings i wonder what's the important stuff is it important to have two limbs is it important to have eyes like it was obvious that the sensory mechanism of eyes like sight were to develop how many times if you were on earth would the sensory mechanism of sight develop and what would it look like would it be one giant eye or it'd be two what's with the symmetry why are we so damn symmetrical in in response to steve jay gould's proposition yes most people who would who argue that life is convergent and it will in fact lead to a few determined outcomes or the or it's not that the outcome is determined per se but it's the pathways are restricted and the mutational trajectories that life can act upon are already very limited so that the final outcomes are a few and eyes being one of them so the con the convergence at the eye level was suggested as an example was presented as an example of why life may actually embark on the same solution over and over again given that many species evolved it independently from one another do you think there's any inkling of truth to that like is it just us humans thinking we're special i think the those innovations came again so far after the i know it's fun stuff it's the the fun stuff yes because it's it's thank you i mean thank you i think we humans tend to talk about the later stuff but without the earlier stuff so if i may if i may think of earlier there's and i i ask this to my students too i want them to close their eyes and think about just nothingness but dust we're we're we don't have trees we don't have plants when we say an empty place or visually at least to we are talking about a planet that is really alien so understanding our own past is similar to understanding an alien planet altogether given that it is a very different planet that did not have any oxygen for two billion years we there's nothing that is familiar to us that we would even think about with when we think about life that is present in our past yet here we are so cool that from that came this like houses and people and and we are very very we are the super late arrivals to the party right so this is definitely not our planet it's the microbial planet that we live in but the potential to create us was always there like this know that because we were created oh i don't know i what is it is you think it's possible this even for the early stuff yeah maybe if it's super unlikely yeah that we just got super this is the planet that got really lucky given the chemistry like maybe to create the bacteria it's not so lucky but to create complex organisms all the way up to mammals that's super lucky yes and it may all come down to a few innovations that happened at the molecular level that may or may not be inevitable that's that so all all these molecular tricks may have enabled the the sort of mere existence of whatever you are able to define as familiar to yourself and you have a hope that science can answer this these questions to reconstruct science is answering these questions i mean it's we are limited just going back to the beginning in our ways right so we rely on biology it says overwritten you're talking about four four billion year old records that is ever changing again makes it beautiful but also makes it difficult it's not tractable geology has some degree to some degree it has a record of a more static frozen state record that is embedded on itself on the surface of this planet if we can find them and that's the key that most of these recorded remnants are if we are lucky we find them they are not naturally selected they are the they are found they need to be found for us to read them so we work with a very handful set of samples especially when we talk about the deep past the planet with no oxygen when we pass the great oxidation event threshold that is about two point five billion years so the earliest life is even harder you are trying to write the story of life based on a handful of rocks and what is recorded on them speaking of finding select remnants of our deep past you said that you've been thinking about nick neland's essay on scientific knowledge and scientific abstraction so let me ask you where do you think scientific questions and answers or in general ideas come from you're a scientist you ask very good questions and try systematically and rigorously to answer them through experiment where where do you think ideas come from so ideas come all the time right there there are all kinds of ideas there are good ideas there are not so good ideas there are really exciting ideas maybe some boring ones but if if you are really interested in doing something different then you need to be willing to take the risk to be wrong and that's incredibly difficult it's even though we talked about the idealist sort of notion behind science that we ultimately want to be rejected or our ideas need to be rejected for it to for the entire infrastructure to move forward there there is a level of risk taking i think behind any creative idea and and i mean that in a true sense if you are disappointed that your idea didn't work then it wasn't a risk because you still hoped that it will work mhmm true risk is that you accept that this may not work so that the failure shouldn't also surprise you yeah is it when you embark on stuff do you when you embark on an idea do you actually contemplate and accept failure like as a as a as a possibility i wouldn't say so but i eliminated a lot of the things out of my work line by simply not feeling like studying them i was bored chasing certain questions and i so you trusted the signal of boredom as a as a good sign that it's not a good question the the it should definitely be whatever you're doing should be exciting to you if you're the only if there's only one person that should be ever excited about what you're doing that should be you yeah and that's enough for for that idea to go somewhere i think that you need to believe in the idea but at the same time i think it's important to not fall in love with your mistakes you know that you if if something isn't working you should let it go instead of trying to fix it even though you feel that this is a mistake or you know that it's a mistake in order to ease i'm sorry instead of trying to fix it you should wrap it up and move on to something else which is incredibly hard good advice for science but also good advice for relationships but okay so like the but that's actually really hard especially i mean this is like phd stuff like if you sink in so much of your time not even phd the entire entire scientific careers it's really tough to let go yes and there is not a lot of room for true freedom maybe at at this certain degree so first you need to be trained right it's not that scientists are just brilliant amazing humans i mean they just know and learn how they they they know how to do science because they're trained in how to do science so that that is important because i i as someone who wants to definitely i'm hoping that i'm giving the message that this is for everybody that there's this notion of science scientists being super smart people that's definitely not true right it is a method that you learn to solve a problem that's really what science is and some are really good at it and they they get better at it under really good guidance maybe good mentorship and ultimately everyone finds their own style of problem solving and what sort of problems they solve but i have not met a scientist that finds their own pursue boring well it can happen but they're not going to be affected just like you said i think it's kind of interesting because in in the age of social media and and attention economies and stuff like that you know i've interacted with a lot of folks like youtubers and so on i i think a lot of their work is driven by what others find exciting and i think that ultimately leads to a life that's not fulfilling i can see the reason behind it or perhaps there's a again failure fear of failure that can be a major determinant of that pattern right so you try to do something that is accepted by others because that's maybe unlikely to give results right away but it's a long game it's a very long game and if you are aiming a long term change and long term impact you gotta be very very patient about it and you better tame your ego yeah i mean on on youtube and those kinds of places on the internet on social media you get feedback like right away and so it's yes even harder to be patient yes so and because yeah change and ideas develop over a period of months and years not decades and the response from social media and so on is on the rate of seconds minutes and hours so i recommend actual physical libraries for people who may wanna appreciate or remember the sense of time and and how long it takes to build something i think it is you're right that's the immediacy and the right response of and and and the fact that the these places are the algorithm wants you to respond right away and and interact with itself right so i can see the appeal but through innovation i think it doesn't even scream it doesn't it's not shiny especially in the beginning but it's also important to not fool ourselves and think that everything that people criticize has some super important meaning behind it so it's a mix of the technique the methods and your gut feeling yeah and a weird dance between learning and accepting the the ideas of the current science and at times trusting your gut and rejecting those because science progresses by sometimes rejecting the ideas of the past or sometimes building on them in a way that changes them transforms them yes and and i think what is hard is to really drill down into into a concept right so you can create a a new thing and then it may be appealing and get a lot of gain a lot of traction but to sustain that to continue that you really need to show the true expertise and so it's not only about defining a problem but then really systematically solve that problem maybe over the course of decades you mentioned the library i've also saw that you've translated scientific documents or at least like mentioned that you did it at at some point in your life so let me ask you how much do you think is lost in translation in science and in life how many languages do you speak two two how how much is lost in translation in in science and in life between those two but it's actually three because science is like another language right it is i speak russian a little bit of french and it's always fascinating to see how much it lost and the soviet union has a tradition of science and mathematics and so on and it's interesting that a lot of the wisdom gained from that part of the world is lost basically because of it was never translated well i'm not sure if it is lost per se i mean i maybe it's more like a gain in some sense right because you understand and science is ultimately human pursue so you cannot separate as much as maybe it's the best system that humans ever came up with to seek knowledge to generate and make sense of the world it works most of the time it doesn't mean it's perfect did the kind of translation do by the way was for scientific work i directly translated for scientific work yes i think that again brains are equally distributed but not opportunities are not right so if you want to include if you want to benefit from all human power whatever we can generate as human beings you need to include everybody on the table and that is by extending the opportunity it's i think most of us that make it tend to think that we did because of something special about ourselves and but it is important to know that no we were given opportunities and that's why we are here not because there was something inherently special about us or or that this this system truly selects for the ones that really are yeah and language is a part of the opportunity yeah language is an opportunity because comes with similar to bacteria right they they speak these languages they they they have we even we call this we call culturing the bacteria we call it culturing right when we grow bacteria that we isolate from the environment in the lab meaning that you create an environment for them to grow and thrive and sustain themselves that's what we say but cultures for microbiologists for language with language comes a different culture a different perspective and and you bring that to the table i mean it's brings the sense of diversity that can only be achieved by clashing perhaps two different cultures two different languages two different approaches maybe in some cases four different approaches yeah i i think language is not just a mechanism of communication it's a way to it's a dynamic system of exploring ideas and it's interesting to see that different languages explores ideas differently yes and i think that so when i said science is like a language itself i said it in two different ways one is very very literal meaning that you can speak english but you that doesn't mean you will understand the scientific paper that it's a different level of english that you need to learn to understand even not just for scientific papers even from discipline to discipline i i challenge any chemist to read an evolutionary biology paper and vice versa it may sound extremely different a different language altogether yeah but there's also the the language of communicating and because words matter how we talk matter how we represent our science matters so yes just learning english as a second language alone is not gonna make you fluent in science either and it's interesting because in that sense you speak many more than three languages because you're pretty cross disciplinary it seems like you're you're you have a foot in in a lot of disciplines i mean you're mentioning geology biology evolutionary biology i mean there's chemistry biochemistry biophysics even we do a lot of statistics so there's a lot of mathematics to what we do as well yes we like to think of it as this an astrobiology program says it's i repeat it because it's fun that it is not a fruit salad but it's a smoothie that that's what we are generating it's not a fruit salad it's a so a smoothie is a successful is a successful combination of those fields and a fruit salad is not i wouldn't say success necessarily it's some if you put it if if you put the wrong ingredient then you press the blender you know you've made it a smoothie you mean it can ruin the entire case can it can it though because i feel like everyone i can definitely assess that for ginger first those that ruins every smoothie i don't like ginger i think so but it's just a personal thing and also i don't like cinnamon but oh the ginger has a cinnamony taste because i thought ginger was no i don't think they do but i i also don't like wasn't that a thing they add in a lot of smoothies i was forced a smoothie i i went to malibu with a good friend of mine dan reynolds and he forced me to consume a smoothie and you know it's probably the first smoothie i've ever had because i always had was very judgmental of the kind of places and people that drink smoothies but it was it was good it was good well smoothie is very american so i yeah it is an american thing i wouldn't say success per se but it is true that when you dance at the edge of different disciplines that that's when the inevitably the innovation will rise because you will see things maybe a little differently when you're on the edge right so but it will probably take longer and it may not be understood right away it may not come into final form quickly given that it is a new concept rising so therefore the patience will make more sense i'm sorry patience will be even more important so if you are in other words if you are into immediate appreciation that's probably not the way to go you're one chemical organism so let me ask maybe a little bit more of a personal thing where did your life form originate and what fond memory do you have from the early days of childhood that represent of your bacteria culture i was born in istanbul so i grew up in turkey a city that has two continents which is quite interesting you have a you see a welcome to europe sign and then welcome to asia sign same day depending on which part of the bridge you are so that that's where i was born and i spent about roughly twenty years of my life and then i immigrated to united states it's a very proud culture it's a beautiful culture it's a very flavorful culture what aspects of it is part of who you are what what are the beautiful aspects that you carry with you in your heart i think we are very sincerely human as a culture think that we have the saying that don't go to bed full if your neighbor is hungry so you know you wouldn't eat any food in front of someone where i come from without offering to share the bite so i think those things however small they may sound a really big deal especially when you are put in a or move to a place that may not have those attributes so i think that culturally there'll be a lot of conscious like and you know just raw deep human the connection connection value the connection between human beings i think so yeah i think i definitely carried that with me we talk a lot about biology let me ask you about the romantic question what role does love play in the human condition or in the entirety of life on earth it's not easy to learn how to or how to love if you're not loved okay so so it's something but the good news is that it is something that you can learn i think that's you you can practice and and teach yourself how to maybe give yourself the thing that wasn't given to you and then ultimately give it to others i think it would be quite arrogant to think that we will be capable of loving it could be anything really so just like translation it's a repeating and a dynamical process that you can learn yeah that you can learn yes and you should learn yeah we should even there's no excuse to not learning to love yeah because that's a deeply human thing it is a deeply human thing it's it is a very sad thing if if any one of us passes this planet without knowing what love is and that could be a love to a pet a love to a plant to a robot to a just kidding or a fake plant we love we can't help who we love what advice would you give to a young person today high school college how to have a career they can be proud of or how to have a life they can be proud of you said an interesting thing about brains being distributed evenly but opportunity is not it's it's really interesting to think about i've i've talked to folks from africa you realize that there's whole areas of this earth that have so much brilliance but unfortunately so little opportunity and one one of the exciting things about the twenty first century is more and more opportunities are created and so the brilliance is unlocked in all those different places and so all these young people now have the opportunity to like do something to change the world i had a chance to visit bosnia so i was invited to give a talk in a very up north like very northernmost part of the country that was impacted by the war tremendously and it was a public talk it was open to everybody in the village and i was told even people drew from sarajevo to attend whenever i think about our role as a scientist or the beneficiaries of the knowledge that we create i always think about that night that's how many people were in that room it was incredibly crowded and the lot of lots of young people who were trying to start everything new and not do or or not carry sort carry replace whatever maybe the the feeling that was taken from them with hope and love mhmm start a new beginning be the seed for the next generation and it moved me so much that they all came to hear about early life space something maybe different for them that maybe they were always interested in and never thought about but what what stayed with me was the just the look and the feeling the look on their faces and the feeling in the room the energy just was very moving to me their willingness to be the seed the the first of their family and generation to do that big music yes and i go leap and that's exactly why i'm telling this whole story because some for most of us we may have to be that seeds in our families that the first one to do something new to do to break that cycle whatever is it that you want to break free from i want i would want the young people to know that you can be that that's that there are just wonderful things to learn from this life and it's just incredible to be living and i would want them to know that their voice matters and they need to use it especially those who think that their voice doesn't matter and ultimately i think what it comes down to is to trusting yourself trusting and respecting your voice if you're not loved learn how to love if you were not respected start by respecting yourself learn how to respect yourself you can teach yourself things yeah it's really difficult when you're surrounded by people that don't believe in you yes so i think i definitely know the feeling and i would just want them to know that they don't need to be defined by or reduced down to what others see in them believe in yourself have the respect please try to develop the respect and the love for yourself and then from that it flourishes you find others that'll give you love it may not i mean life is not fair it's true yeah yeah it's be be prepared that it's it's a it's a it's not very fair unfortunately and so i don't wanna depict this disney story that and then yes and everything will be just fine it's mostly isn't but you learn a way learn you know life does it all the time speaking of which what do you think is the meaning of all this what's the meaning of life i why are we here why we are here all the beauty you've discussed why is the translational mechanism machinery here why i don't think there's beauty why so much beauty it is because we choose to see it that way it's beautiful but there is no meaning i don't think no yeah but why is it so beautiful why did we choose why from where is the imperative to see it as to see so much beauty in a thing that scientifically speaking or from a rational perspective is void of beauty it's just it just is not everybody chooses to see the beauty haters gonna hate i mean we're have the capacity to see the beauty the capacity so why why not use it to the fullest right we we have the capacity but that that capacity isn't that fascinating that we developed that it feels like that was always laid in there into in the whole process introspect ourselves i mean i this definitely would be soothing to things like that but i don't think there is a meaning like that way i that that's it's fascinating that we can understand it but why is it soothing there's a desire there's a longing but soothing doesn't mean that there's a meaning why why is soothing a meaning let me just put it this way because there is just i think so much unfairness going on i wouldn't even dare myself to think that there's a meaning to out of my out of respect to the ones that are suffering i see i think i think out of suffering emerges flourishing in beauty i mean that's what i see i agree with you when i went and and went to ukraine it's all the people suffering in their eyes and in their stories is a hope for the future is a love is a love for the people who are still living is a love for life so it's there and that's the dark thing is the suffering and the law somehow intensifies your appreciation of the life that is the left that's a weird thing too that there is some something about still doing your best and believing that there's there whatever the goodness is worth working for is beyond and and to do that without a meaning there's something more humbling and and profound about that and and i i we have a this will come out very random okay so just in turkish bathrooms mhmm there is this sign that says leave it as you want to find it yeah and i think that's a pretty good that's your that's the meaning of life found in the turkish i there's wisdom to that there's wisdom to that but it also is because the however you live defines you right mhmm so i think there's some profound meaning to that too that just just leave it as you would want to find it so that your little scribble in the long story of life on earth is one that ultimately did a pretty good job you know it it at least kept it the same as you found it or or at least i left it in the way that i i wish i found it yeah yeah right oh man yes that's that's the wisdom from turkish bathrooms that's where i search for wisdom as well and as as we we we started with the origin of life and ended with the wisdom in a turkish bathroom i think that's a perfect conversation you're an incredible person the humor the humanity but also the brilliance of your work i really appreciate that you would talk with me today this was really fun thanks for having me thanks for listening to this conversation with bhatul kochar to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with one of my favorite quotes from robert frost in three words i can sum up everything i've ever learned about life it goes on thank you for listening i hope to see you next time
