slash lex this is a lex fridman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's levy rossman you're known for being able to guess people's elo rating so what do you think just by looking at my face deep into my eyes what what's my elo rating here i'll help you i'll i'll do e four for the listener i actually read that stockfish prefers e four does it really i didn't i actually didn't know that because it maximizes the number of tactical options so that makes sense the right answer is thirty four hundred which is i believe stockfish you guessed people's elo chest rating what what's that take how hard is it to do that and like how would you actually do that like what are telltale signs of red flags about a person at different ratings is there something you look for yeah i think you can separate it something like the very first the zero to about eight nine hundred for simplicity's sake i'm gonna use the chest dot com rating system because leechast is slightly different it tends to go two three hundred points higher than chez dot com sometimes even four five hundred points higher but then it catches up they catch up around twenty two twenty three hundred i would say what's chess dot com what's lee chess can you like yeah so explain what the difference is and what they are they're two chess websites good starting point yes chess dot com is it has obviously the free option option where you can play games you get some sort of puzzles every single day you get some sort of lessons every single day but then they have tiered memberships where you can pay annually or per month that you can unlock all the other features and like what like for training for like for training puzzles and all that kind of stuff they have unlimited puzzles but they also have their their biggest selling point for sure is like a dedicated game review that it's like very flashy and sophisticated and the coach will literally tell you what you did wrong at every single moment the computer got it evaluated a mistake but the most important thing that they have is they offer international masters grand masters the opportunity to make video lesson libraries which hundreds of hours of anything i can even learn some stuff on there probably i have anal beads that are con communicating with stockfish via bluetooth yeah we will get to that yes we will get to that it's it's epic it's actually scary how many people think that's a real thing by the way which is the danger of the internet but we we yeah we will get into that but i tend to believe that people believing a thing that's hilarious at scale will make that thing a reality i'm with elon on this i think people manifest the meme the meme becomes real so that but that that's in all walks of life i i think there is something about humor sort of being why does why did i i was gonna what was that i was going to say is i feel like humor becomes a lubricant for the trajectory of human civilization and i don't know why the word lubricant went into my head which beads i understand yeah but it's very freudian yeah anyway so to zero to nine hundred if you're a thirteen hundred player you were saying if you're not good at end games you don't understand how to convert positions that have seven or eight pieces left on the board you don't know when you're supposed to activate your king you don't know how a bishop outplays a knight with just several pawns on the board those are all very important things because it's not just about knowing the theoretical end games like some positions in chess are literally solved yeah if i showed you a position i asked what's the evaluation and how do you win it there's a technique you're supposed to know that technique and the coaches on chess dot com can help or no yeah so these lesson libraries it's not like a live lesson it's prerecorded training position walk you through it and then there's a dynamic factor as well where you can practice you can practice the theoretical and you can practice a practical game where there's no set format to do something mhmm it's just based on your previous experience basically lichess is their entire thing is it's an open source website that tries to be as free as possible and operates totally on donations they don't have any advertisements they don't have which is weird because normally in big competitive settings it's all capitalistic you have one big entity and another big entity and they're both for profit but in this case the big argument is well they offer a lot of things for free you can analyze your games for free you can you can go into bleacher's lessons library and do things for free the comparison that i always make is chess dot com is basically like having a good personal trainer and having someone to help you at the gym lichess says you have to do the the all the stuff yourself so you can combine youtube with leechist no one's gonna really point you in the right direction you gotta go fully explore on your own if you wanna do it you can i also like to say can i make a controversial joke yes okay ardent alicia supporters are like very angry you know only vegetarian or or vegan folks because they will tear you apart and try to convert you as much as possible did you just did you just point a large number of of haters onto this very podcast is this what just happened no is there like several people that were very upset at you right now no and throwing things okay no no that's always the joke that i've made because if people have chez dot com and i love all people but i'm just saying chez dot com patrons do not try to actively convert folks on lichess folks on lichess are like you know there's a meme chez dot com chez dot c it started at lichess it started it started somewhere in red on reddit anarchy chess kind of a oh so leechas is a little bit of an anarchist organization would you would you go as far as to say they're a terrorist terrorist extremist organization are we going there for legal reasons that's i thought lichess has like really good analysis like somebody does it have an engine for analysis of like games or is that is that an open source thing that like they both do they both use stockfish fifteen okay and then the rest is the interface around stock stockfish that shows it's tough it's it's the live so chess has a live server where you and i can play a game against each other we just both seek and if we have the same rating we have the same criteria yep we'll we'll play a game but there's also reviewing your own games there's an opening database so you can see what the most popular trends are so lee chess is is great like i'm i'm sponsored by chezs dot com and i will openly say that mhmm but you can't have you're deeply biased yes okay but i'm also complimenting the competitor okay but but can you play games on lee chezs or is it just for analysis yeah yeah you can yeah they're so it's the same exact thing so they're like legitimately competitors not exactly the same thing but they have the they're trying to match for features but you're saying lee chess is more chaotic and then chess dot com is more like professional yeah i don't i don't know i don't know if it's chaotic i just know that it's you have to no one's gonna hold your hand if you if if you go to to liches you absolutely can you can play games you can analyze your games but you have to discover yourself the whole point of chezs dot com is to make the journey as simple as possible but i also firmly believe you can't have any sort of growth in chess without a chess dot com or a chess twenty four what's that oh what's chess twenty four so chess twenty four was another live server with some lesson libraries and so on but they were i think the process was they were bought by play magnus mhmm so what's play magnus play magnus that's that's magnus carlsen's yeah he he doesn't own it he owns some stake in it i think nine or ten percent they owned a bunch of chess companies including chess twenty four but now it seems like they're either merging or basically getting acquired by chess dot com got it and then play magnus it's an app also where you can play max at different levels but there's also the educational stuff yes okay the for profit chess companies make the option for grandmasters to make a living to make chess and esport yeah elite chess is great it's doesn't put on any events there's no commentary so you you can have both in theory and probably some controversy is good does chess dot com like sponsor you like help you out in some way like what's the connection between your videos and streams and so on in chess dot com like are they supporting people in that way or no my content they don't necessarily i just make whatever i want like i i don't have not sense like if they do something stupid i will call out their leadership it's not like but i to have the logo up like in my youtube videos or in my yeah that's just that kind of stuff yeah so anyway back to i mean that was really helpful i was confused about all of that no worries the guessing people's rating mhmm so the thing you mentioned about the endgame if you don't know what the hell you're doing with the endgame what does that mean about you raining if you don't know how to finish with just a few pieces on the board you could be my rating that's the self endgame is tough that's the self deprecating humor we tuned in for when endgame are hard man they're they're so they're very difficult you can't have there's a reason magnus is the best it's because seven hours into a game when everybody's given up he's still squeezing juice out of the fruit so that's the way i would describe it so that's not a good source of information if you no within the first fifteen moves generally you can tell because you can tell how well they played the opening so how well they knew what they were supposed to memorize what they were supposed to play and then how they react to piece interactions so if they are faced with a move that a more advanced player would deal with very swiftly because there's kind of a natural response that gives you information if they move their king when they're in check when they didn't have to that's a massive giveaway some people just think oh i'm in check so i have to move my king out so it's like how direct the response of your play is to the danger so like if you're more moving like multiple pieces at a time meaning like you're moving like the the pieces are like tied together in interesting ways and then okay okay like what about like what about the opening can you tell also because a lot of people can memorize openings right yeah but takes two to tango so you could memorize a bunch of stuff but if you're nine hundred and i'm nine hundred my rating is fluctuating all over the place in the in in this podcast i feel like twelve thirteen nine hundred yeah you can memorize things i'm gonna play some crap and you can't play the way you you memorize mhmm because i have to respond to you in certain ways so you will either respond the way you think you're supposed to respond and that will probably be incorrect or now you have to figure out how to deal with the fresh position oh so the nine hundred will reflect itself in both cases yeah yeah yeah i wonder if actually so do you know your current rating or no or your top rating what was your top i know i know both my current elo like over the board now it's twenty three twenty my peak was twenty four thirty oh cool so can you play like a nine hundred player like can you force yourself yeah so you can like given that you've guessed a lot of elo ratings can you kinda emulate that it's kind of an interesting question for me yeah yeah of course before i was doing youtube and twitch i was teaching kids so i had to not only did i have to play at their rating i also had to play and sometimes even behave and explain things in a way that the kid could understand so absolutely yeah i think that's what contributed to the growth of the channel frankly i kind of understood how beginners thought about the game so yeah you did you taught people chess you coached people for for many years i guess in in new york yeah new york yeah what what did you learn about the way people learn from that so like how how did people that were successful at getting good at chess quickly mhmm what were the some of the commonalities some of the patterns that you saw obsession yeah what does obsession look like i i would say it's obsession and also and also love of the game so if you're bored you don't wanna watch a show you wanna boot up chez dot com or lichess just for just so i don't get yeah flamed by any anyone in the audience and you just play so you're saying that lee chess people are the ones that would attack aggressively they're the kind of people the the chess twenty four people che oh that's another so there's not i i didn't know i thought chess twenty four was part of the chess dot com well now yes a cult or tribe or whatever terms you wanna use no no i'm sure there's even more places to play live there always have been more places to play live but chess like omnitchell dominated well chess twenty four is this is rough for live interface of course they have good courses and everything but yes i got it i got it and some are even good people or whatever yes how that quote goes okay like obsession that means the way they look at the board when they're bored how quickly do they return to the chessboard that kind of stuff just like how many hours a day they they want to spend yes they spend and wants to spend some kids definitely have a talent of course there's this eternal debate talent versus hard work i don't necessarily know if it's a talent for chess specifically but it's a talent for i'm sure there's some sort of spatial visualization in your mind you're you start picking up what squares are controlled by your pieces and opponent's pieces faster your memory is much stronger so you you don't just learn openings like we discussed you learn literal patterns such as oh i remember this from two tournaments ago i remember this from a game i played just yesterday and you just keep playing and playing and playing but i think the one commonality i think i've seen in all kids it's obsession you have to play a lot and i've seen kids who are brilliant kids like if you give them a page of tactics puzzles they solve faster than anybody they can pick things up here super fast they're a pleasure to teach they go to a tournament disaster they can't handle the anxiousness they can't handle that silent face to face war with another six year old they can't even handle there's also trash talk let's take one sentence by a by a kid can throw off your prized student and i've seen kids just totally disintegrate i've seen also my students bully other kids scoring my student wasn't that strong yeah but their verbal warfare which is not allowed but goes unnoticed it's not even verbal warfare like just going like like yeah literal literal like like facial expressions you would make at the board yeah i didn't even think about that that's pretty creepy the intensity not creepy that's not the right word but there's an intensity in that silence over the board like you can probably hear stuff like just like it's super quiet it's like a library yep and then there's just a tension that builds you can hear the breathing yeah and at the highest level both sides are involved in a battle that they both foresee ninety nine percent of the time that's the scary part is that you both see the exact same thing it's very rare you play move and i didn't see it it's that i misevaluated it i saw the move could be played but i missed something three or four moves deeper you play that move and suddenly you're excited and i'm nervous mhmm but all of a sudden you make an inaccuracy and now the tide shifts right we could be on totally different planes throughout the game or we could be on the same plane throughout the game so it's it's really fascinating it yeah so your thought is when you see a move that to you seems suboptimal you start to think what was that you start to try and make sense of that did you miscalculate or did they miscalculate what isn't that what magnus is really good at is taking people away from like making suboptimal moves to take them away from the known openings or is that unfair to say yeah he gets part of his really dominant reputation i think from not letting people get into ultra theoretical positions he just won this tournament this online tournament and he said he had a a young player strategy he had an anti sorry a anti young player strategy what's that mean it means that by move seven or eight you go to the database no games right kid is on their own they have to swim on their own yeah and they have to deal with the strategic complexities of the position which he just he gets and he might get from just an enormous database within his brain of historical games that have similar structures or just sheer genius like we we we won't know yeah it's a mix of the two for sure the younger you are you can't remember a game played in nineteen fifty one in some bar in the soviet union but he does because he read a book once or a magazine once and he just remembers he just remembers he remembers the structure which is just it's not fair it's crazy right what do you think makes him if we can sort of link on it what do you think makes him so good i think it's the memory and i think it's he just seems to get the game better than anybody else that's the best way i i can describe it in sports you have reaction time you have strength you have but also as he's now evolving its stamina so there have been games that if you put two other twenty seven fifty rated players or world top ten players they would have drawn the game the game would have ended the game nobody would have won it you put magnus as one of the aggressors in that game suddenly the chance of victory doubles from five percent to ten percent weird what what's that about because the was it game six against napa like right isn't stockfish say that it's supposed to be a draw so zero point zero zero does mean a draw sometimes but other times it means and it's the joke i always make it means that stockfish is out for a smoke break it just it just it can't can you explain the joke and can you explain zero point zero zero yes so when so stockfish will show an evaluation which determines whether the position is equal slightly better for one side slightly better for the other side or completely winning you can you know zero point zero zero point two minus zero point two that's all within a balance you can say okay black has a little sprinkle of activity something white has that but if it's zero zero zero it could be literally a dead draw meaning theoretically just impossible to win but oftentimes what that means is the smoke break joke is cypress doesn't know there is so much complexity within the position the combinations of different moves that are acceptable and okay it cannot evaluate correctly wow so even the end games are tough for stockfish which is why magnus won that game because there was practical value remaining it wasn't a dead draw he continued to ask questions over the course of six or seven hours he would sacrifice a pawn he would sacrifice another pawn to damage the structure valuation stayed the same because a machine could stop him but not jan and that was one of my favorite re that that that game ruined my whole day by the way way it destroyed because i saw i saw yeah i made so many plans that day it completely ruined my day but it was a very worthy recap you were just all in you watched that whole game i watched the whole game and the world championship was a crazy time because i wanted to be first with the recap video but i also wanted to be best with the recap video so i spent all the hours of the games watching all the live broadcast and getting all the information all the variations and trying to put that into the recap it it was a lot of fun it there was a huge adrenaline done when it was all over so just for people who don't know that's the most recent world championship so you had a i mean that that was a draw after draw after draw after draw yeah and it was it was kinda boring in that way or maybe our draw is is there like nonboring parts within the draw to you when you were like just studying it carefully for me yes for the average viewer no that's the truth especially when the game itself is not that exciting when magnus plays a strange move on move nine or ten that hasn't ever been played and then jan has to try to exploit it and he fails and no attack builds up and they shuffle their pieces for three hours my favorite thing is when the commentators are like i don't know why he did that i wonder why he did that like yeah when the commentators are confused that's my as a as a person who's just a spectator just like that's that's interesting because then you the most interesting part is about listening to the commentators who i guess themselves might be grandmasters all yeah all they are trying to i guess just like nepo just like magnus tried to figure out what's the idea here what are you thinking yeah that's cool that's that's that's an interesting part of the game but other than that it's it seemed yeah i'm i'll i was sure this is just gonna keep being a draw especially in that situation mhmm so it's almost it seems almost remarkable that his magnus was able to put pull out a win in game six and after that at least magnus said that that that ends it because now that was gonna have to take more risks and that opens it up to pure chess and then it's who was it steve prefontaine said like when whenever it's whenever this race is down to like pure guts then that's when i win it there was also a conversation about ian's first half second half in any tournament in the first half he's just brilliant on fire you could even say he was out playing magnus but the entire conversation before the match was jan slows down and at the first sign of a loss or a setback the match might fall apart and that was the worst way to lose there was literally no worse way and it just got worse from there and there i mean it was one move mistakes and but he's back he's gian has won the candidates again he's gonna play for the world championship so who you got who who who you got what is what is this slang terminology can can we like somehow edit that into a more sophisticated with a british accent type of phraseology okay who do you think will win that match i think it's fifty five forty five but i don't know who i don't know that's not the so it's close it's very close okay you can make both cases you could say ding you could say jan has been here before you can say to the world championship stage he knows what it's like to have a training camp and so on and so forth his playing style is very but you can also say ding liren is one of the most stable unemotional chess players and ding oftentimes goes from down to up so in the candidates he lost to jan in the very first game fourteen round tournament he got demolished in the first game i'm sure he was suffering from jet lag the flight he he came to spain like two days before the games began which was crazy to me and he got second place by the end his chances of finishing in the top two were like two percent after that first round game people wrote him off completely he doesn't go from top down he goes the opposite way and if he loses he might come back but the truth is i don't know the truth is it's it's gonna be an interesting match and it's also disappointing we're not gonna get magnus in it yeah what do you think about him stepping away from the world championship are you a romantic about the world championships no i'm not a romantic about anything i don't think i i can't imagine it went dark it went dark quickly i don't think i'm sophisticated enough to be a romantic i think i you know i i i taught chess and now i make youtube videos i i'm not qualified on the subject of romanticism but i you don't think it's a beautiful game chess yeah no i think i i think it is a beautiful game i got you yeah is that is that considered being romantic yes i was seeing the beauty in the you can be like bach in seeing the math in the music or you can see the beauty the magic i i think i see beauty in in certain types of chess for sure not in all chess so i'll partially romantic part time romantic yeah yeah so what i mean what what do you feel about magnus stepping away from the world championships disappointing but understandable can you steal man his case what's what's what's understandable about it to you i don't think it's as prestigious as it could be i don't think the world championship yeah yeah why does magnus still sign everything as world champion then that's a good point that that he did just put out a statement and he did say it but he does it everywhere else too does he really yeah like world champion right world champion i don't know world champion world chess champion maybe it's just because he he he won it but he thinks that the journey to the top once again to maintain the status quo has lost its appeal you know what the example that that i like to i like to make i i'm a big fan of ufc mhmm so we've never really seen with the exception of george saint pierre walking and and khabib but khabib was kind of a different story walking away from a belt at the absolute zenith of their career but also in the ufc champions are extremely well taken care of i mean champions have some of the best some of the best lives of course you can argue not all champions you can say some of the lower weight divisions yes but what i'm saying is a lot of them get all the sponsors they get massive massive paydays they're massive paydays they're international celebrities i don't think chess has that in fact the world championship of chess prize fund has not changed much in like forty years so you could probably make more money on on youtube yes playing randos not randos but other having fun and playing challenging really challenging games playing other super grandmasters like in ad hoc events or maybe a little bit organized events but not the world championship yeah and still and still have a lot of fun make a lot of money get everybody excited all that kind of stuff yeah so for magnus specifically and we're using him because he's the world champion if you tally if he wins every tournament that he plays in over the course of a year which is really not even that crazy of an estimate because that's really how it seems sometimes yeah i don't know how much money that is i haven't tallied but if he dedicated an entire year to being managed on social media and doing various things and growing all his brands and getting sponsored deals i i think he would make five times more than being the world champion which is crazy yeah but money isn't everything i know that's that's totally fair dedicate their whole life to winning the olympics the olympics is a funny is an interesting one too because like i didn't even watch the the olympics as carefully as i usually do this year yeah me neither it's it's really strange i'm not sure why that is and during covid i'm not sure that's that was weird i don't know if it's losing its magic part of it is also the people that own the olympics and the way they distribute it they make it a little bit more difficult to watch like it's it should in my opinion it should all be just available on youtube and easily accessible it's like the difference between like spacex and and some other like even nasa just spacex is better at streaming their launches and and commentating them and it they've made nasa better as well but just like the ability it sounds ridiculous but making it more frictionless for people to watch get excited to share all that kind of stuff yeah like i'm not exactly sure where the magic like balances between the the class each traditional world championships and the kinda dramatic exciting streamer world and it feels like for for the world championships to be relevant they have to find that balance yeah well this recent one had i was it's pretty good commentating yeah yeah no i i'm not i'm not even necessarily talking about myself though there was a lot of so that was the worst part for me no there was well everything you did amazing yeah i i appreciate that it was a lot of it was a big arms race so every major chess platform tried to get one super grand master mhmm deshwanathan anand fabiana caruana you name it they were they were basically involved and to to go back to that point yeah i the big question is money and if if magnus is not motivated by money if the prize fund for the next world championship was ten million dollars would he play it if he says no then it must be something else it must just be a matter of something's not worth it it's not worth it you gotta think about his word and his word is like there's too much stress to the low sample play yeah like i wanna play many more times yeah he wants to play more he wants to he wants to make more interesting yeah exactly yeah more shorter games like where you can increase the possibility of pure chess whatever the heck that means yeah but we can't go back to the first karpov kasparov match which they had to stop due to health concerns i mean the guy went down five nil and it was first to six wins and draws didn't count so draws didn't amass to the total score there was no best of system so what happened there the match went something like seven eight months kasparov started making a comeback after being down five nothing he was five three mhmm and they called it off they called it off they said both players are in poor health conditions because far off storm down yelled that this is a farce and but the match was fifty games long i would even more maybe i made a video and i don't even remember how many games it was it was so long can you imagine bobby fischer wanted something almost as extreme draws don't count as first one to ten wins mhmm and if it's nine nine the world champion retains his title so you have to beat the world champion ten eight that's the only way so you don't like that what i it's just grueling i don't know maybe i like it for the youtube recaps but do i like it for the players and do i like it for general public no for sure it's three four hours right you imagine your favorite tennis match was six months long right what are we doing yeah yeah there's still a magic to the world championship i i wish they could make it some interesting to make it work somehow but i think magnus is really challenging fide and everybody else's step up and try to figure that out which is great ultimately who would you say is the greatest of all time can you can you make the case you mentioned kasparov can you make the case for kasparov can you make the case for madeline skarsonsen bobby fischer tall in my opinion you can make a case for magnus gary and bobby fischer i i'm not one of the folks that's like oh i mean capablanca was brilliant you can argue steinitz was brilliant but as i think i think it was it's probably kasparov and magnus has a chance to overtake it so the longevity is really important to you when you were thinking about this yes i think so i think magnus is very very close i think it's it's extremely close what would be the magic you gotta get that sixth one oh so the no i'm just kidding so the world championships matter it's kinda like basketball right rings it's all all comes down to how many rings did did this person weigh what about well basketball doesn't have this the number of years at number one right like rating sorry yeah like there's a there is a which is what magnus really likes it's like there is a nice system of rating of who isn't ranked number one yeah it has to do not with some championships or low sample tournaments mhmm it has to do with general game after game after game helps estimate more accurately the elo rating so yeah he's been world number one for i think eleven years right which is still less than gary was world number one for twenty years yeah which is which is quite wild but still lower rating i think than magnus now right yeah i think rating in general has sort of allegedly it got inflated yeah i is that true is there a truth to that i think so i don't i can't speak to how exactly it happened but it also happens online if you go back just three or four years i think some of the best blitz players on dot say shows dot com were twenty seven twenty eight hundred and now they're thirty two hundred i think it's just sort of what happens but i i don't exactly know i will mention that there was a very strange change not exactly sure when the year was in fide so over the board chest where if you were under the age of sixteen or eighteen years old one of those two and you were below twenty three hundred k your rating change factor was three to four times higher mhmm so just imagine that means magnus has a rating change factor of of let's say one i have a rating change factor also of one anybody over the rating two thousand four hundred has the same rating change factor what is the rating change factor so if you win yeah there's a formula and basically let's say at the very base level five point change if your rating change factor is one you beat somebody you gain five points those kids who were under eighteen and under twenty three hundred their rating change factor was four so their ratings were going out four times higher and four times like up and down compared to normal folks and there was there was one teenager in the us in particular who in one month played a bunch of tournaments with his rating change factor and became nearly rated two thousand six hundred forty which is top fifty in the world mhmm he was just a random teenager from the united states he became a grand master ultimately but he bled like ninety points down because his rating was so inflated and this the k forty exists now i mean you have many kids who out of nowhere twenty one hundred twenty one hundred twenty four hundred after you know one good month it's like what so that's interesting that's like similar to like how tiktok inflates your virality early on does it well yeah like i i i i well at least the rumor is like they want you to get engaged mhmm and i thought there was even artificial likes and so on that they want you to get that dopamine addiction so maybe they want to throw you if you're really passionate about chess they want you to throw you to the sharks by artificial inflating you inflating your rating and maybe that gets you into the game much more intensely maybe i don't know i wonder how many like backdoor feed in meetings there are with cigars and so that that was the factors determined by who who does the the the elo rating who changes this stuff yeah who the fuck who knows it's probably those leeches anarchists yeah exactly i think they wanna i think they wanna they wanna stay away from that stuff but so there's a guy named hans niemann yep and he beat magnus carlsen recently yeah has been already what is what's august september fourth oh it was september so he beat him twice right recently once is the allegations the by the internet that hans neumann cheated and then the second time magnus played a few moves and forfeited and resigned oh there's actually so there's three okay sorry can you no no yeah can can we go through the yes yes yes so they play a live esports event in miami miami beach yes eden roc that's where i actually interviewed magnus yeah that's where that was mhmm oh by weird circumstance i found myself in miami unrelated to the chess event and yeah it was a very dramatic event for me for various reasons one of which the camera stopped working halfway through the conversation saw that yeah i saw that i also side note i really respect how you write comments pin them at the top you add timestamps you're like very true professional i am the complete opposite on youtube when i'm off the camera so i dig in the mud what does that mean dig in the mud from when i started on youtube in twenty twenty i in june like may june twenty twenty i had no subscribers so i got to a million in a year i had a lot of people analyzing my every move all of my small flaws and i i love getting hate comments because you pin you pin is it the comment of shame or it that's what it was it's been named over the years by by folks i never yeah called it that but yeah it's it's it's pin of shame and pin of shame yes it's been tough because now people pretend to write hate comments just to get attention so like anything the public ruined the good thing but it started that way it started with people just shredding me to bits calling me it was spin offs of this and that and i think i'm i'm a human more than i am a creator an influencer an attention seeker like i'm just a a person so to me even at the size of one point six million subscribers now september twenty twenty two i don't understand that i've gotten big and that i shouldn't do this stuff and that i should be beyond it or i shouldn't be checking my social media as much as i do and interacting one on one i'm still very much a human being and my guilty pleasure my way of killing time if i'm not laying on the couch and playing some chess blitz games off stream is i just interact with people who say nice things and who say horrible things mhmm and i really like to get into the head of the people who say the terrible things sometimes you can sometimes they are truly trolls but sometimes people just they just they just really hate you so what what's a successful what's a successful interaction with the person that's trolling you what's like at the end of that hero journey that you were yeah partaking in what's what's like what's the top of the mountain look like is the troll conquered and broken mentally not no not meant i don't wanna i don't wanna defeat i i honestly sometimes somebody writes a very long comment i'll just i'll respond with a question mark yeah oh so you're you're you see each other as like a like a brother and sister you're gonna travel together on this journey of deep meaning like introspection what does this mean yeah i've had people write i can't quote now but something about my persona my behavior this and that and i just like respond to them and i say hey it sounds crazy that a large creator might do something like this but this kinda goes back to you you speak to folks on a very respectful way if you make a mistake you completely own up to it so i have this sometimes these one on one interactions where i say i think you're reading too much into this i think you're kind of you don't understand maybe some of my humor or sarcasm as as such so you form this opinion that i'm this kind of a person this and that and now you're sorta anything i do you're trying to attach to that reasoning and here you are writing this lengthy essay of why nobody should watch my content and sometimes people go you know what i think you have a point maybe i should relax a little bit they they yeah i would love i i would love to sort of interview and understand the lives of the the folks that post that kind of stuff i mean they're they're human beings they have interesting journeys also yeah i think they often don't realize i think they don't realize their comment will be read by anybody especially you maybe they think like and they also don't realize you're a human being i feel like that's you know it's it's so interesting to watch it like some guy because i posted on twitter for like a minute that i'm talking to you and asking for questions i i deleted that tweet because yeah because you didn't like ninety five percent of the people were talk about cheating talk about the cheating alright i got it thank you this is not gonna be helpful at all so i was like alright but in that time like there's one comment which i'm it's hilarious to me that you found that one comment the one comment says like this seems like a waste of time or something like why lame guest lame guest lame guest and then used like responded something like with a question mark i yeah yeah i wrote why am i a lame guest why am i made a sad face talk about this yeah i was like why am i a lame guest and he responded he responded even after you deleted this tweet he said he doesn't know what value i would bring because i just make videos about chess games yeah and that's true you've had some absolutely brilliant people on uh-huh but i also looked at this gentleman's profile and he his he was one of the folks that put things about his family and god and and his politics in his twitter bio and i started thinking maybe i said something in some video and i i made a joke about religion or something just some offhand five second thing somewhere that someone turns me into just an absolute outcast in the household they can no longer watch me and that has happened yeah that has happened i'll record a thirty minute video and i'll make a joke about something and some phrasing and that's it i've lost a viewer forever and they will let me know they will write me an email and i just don't think people should be that serious yeah there there there's some of that because i'll i've seen people say that sometimes about me but i see it more with others they'll say you know i used to be like joe rogan guesses yeah i used to be a huge fan of joe rogan until he said this mhmm right it's like one first i do wonder if you were ever really a big fan that's that's one question mark i have but the other is like i think when you should be more lenient with each other in terms of how much stupid shit we say yeah and and you know if you actually i wish people were able to sort of introspect on their own on their own on the stupid shit they say themselves like to to to have a little bit of empathy like i wish there was a way to read all the emails you've ever written and just to see or maybe do a search engine for all the stupid shit you've said in emails in the past and like summarize it and to reveal it to yourself that like you have bad days you have good days you have emotional days you have stoic days you have sometimes you have like you take very different political views than you do on other days and it's like it's all over the place and if you're a creator if you're putting stuff out all the time you're gonna have those and you're you're still you're still a full like complex bag of emotions and thoughts and ideas and contradictions and all of that like you shouldn't judge a person by a single statement and even when you do you should try to infer the best possible interpretation of that statement i feel like that that's just a healthier way to interact with the world and with other humans it's like i wonder what's the best possible interpretation of the thing they just tweeted or they said like what let's let's imagine that the person saying those words is actually a really good human being and what did they mean when they said that thing about anal beads right so good for so long yeah right or what what whatever it is like you know they didn't mean to be offensive to the sexuality of a certain group they're they're just talking about they're talking shit about aob it's like they're not like sometimes it's humor sometimes it's actually genuinely embodying like a political viewpoint and like walking with it thinking through it for a few days like like taking it seriously be empathizing not just for a brief moment but for a time like walking with an idea and allowing yourself to express it like playing devil's i do that all the time with yourself or with myself yeah in conversation i do too and i find i have to say i'm playing devil's advocate like you have to be very explicit but with with myself i'll just do it in my head like i have different voices like you know obviously it it just in i've been getting so much information so many thoughts in all the complexities of the war in ukraine for example and all the different voices within ukraine i just interviewed hundreds of people and they have very different perspectives in nuanced ways about the war some are full of hate some are full of love like hate for the other love for their own country love for family and tradition all of it is a beautiful mix and i have to walk i have to like carry those ideas in my head and empathize with them deeply and then i have to listen to people that live elsewhere that live in india they have a very different perspective there's a lot of people in india that have a very different perspective than the people in ukraine and so i don't know and some of that will bleed out into the thoughts i expressed publicly and like when people judge you harshly for it it it first of all me as a human being is psychologically difficult but also it makes me less willing to be fragile i still try to be strong enough to be fragile in front of the camera just say like say things that are on my mind even if i know it's going to create people that are going to be like ruthlessly negative towards me so i tried to wear my heart on my sleeve and still try to be fragile but it's harder you're gonna pay a psychological cost like like i'm you know in some sense i try to be tough but like i i could be a softie in that in like certain certain like attacks can get to me so so i'm surprised that they don't get i mean do do does does some negativity get to you or is this the way you deal with it by responding like that's that guy is saying like what value does talking to a levy add to the world yeah no but that was i mean that was so good i was looking at at i was thinking at various moments you went to jump in and i was i was kind of letting letting you speak one of the things i wanted to mention was it's significantly simpler to talk about chaz than it is to talk about some of the things you talk about and you have a big responsibility because you have to absorb information like a sponge but you also then need to present it in a way where you potentially have an opinion while trying to be fair to everybody and you're talking about things that will literally never please everybody i mean just literally what else so you're gonna talk about some issues that are going to get out there into the and and people are gonna watch it the eyes right the ears of of millions of people and not everybody is going to be satisfied and these are issues where people are going to be much more likely to speak up in all sorts of ways tremendous support or tremendous hatred vitriol and god knows what else yeah you you that's one of the reasons i'm i'm blown away to even be sitting here frankly because up until a few months ago you weren't talking to you know you i'm not saying you weren't talking to but you hadn't spoken to chess players you were speaking to people who are doing much more substantial things in the world i'll i have to get the humility there no but but chess to me is an incredible it's a beautiful game but i think the reason comments hurt is not i mean they hurt no matter what to me like not to me because not to you i'm in a simpler space that's what you have to understand i i i even if so if it's chess based criticism it doesn't hit as hard no if you had a podcast about anal beads no i'm just if you had a podcast i am launching this if you had a podcast launching a new podcast photography you gotta you gotta realize like it wouldn't it wouldn't be the same way you talk about potentially existential things you talk about cyber you know things things in cybersecurity or or ai or people who are massive heads of companies that are just inherently going to be a bit more controversial so that i can't imagine being in your shoes because you have so many complex emotions about situations where you may not necessarily agree with everything that someone has said publicly but you still invite them for a conversation because they're a human being it's totally different lex i don't i don't i don't know i not the way i experienced it to me i think what hurts is it's not even online because i'm super self critical usually way more than the internet can be it's that like human beings can be cruel to each other so like the reason it hurts for some reason is like this almost like this disappointment in people they don't give each other a chance so in that sense the negativity doesn't have to be about ukraine or geopolitics it could be about the silliest of things i see and like to me it's like why why be mean to each other in a context where the mean doesn't like it's out of place because i for example there is like a gaming culture where they just talk shit to each other and not stop i think it's more acceptable there it seems to fit it seems to be funnier there and it like when streamers talk shit to each other i've been listening to several streamers recently and it's like it somehow works a little better even if they're just like cruel to each other yep it makes more sense but i think when people are genuinely trying to educate or to help and so on and you still get the shitty comments i don't know it makes me sad no it doesn't it it it doesn't make me it doesn't make me sad i think part of that is also the way i was brought up so i was i skipped kindergarten so i was always the smallest kid and you you were picked on i was picked on and then i did picking so i had kinda both in my life i kinda know i went home from summer camp crying and i also made a kid cry once in fourth grade nice so i had the balance and i physical or mental abuse or both verbal verbal no i didn't beat anybody up i was tiny i think the kid in the younger grade was bigger than i was and you still broke them because i was an adult that was yeah i so i had to use my mental warfare i had to use my words i had to be and growing up my parents split when i was super young and i played chess so all things that make you super self trustworthy like you believe your first instinct you don't listen to what other people tell you and if people give you advice say okay i'm gonna think about that i'm not gonna go and and do that i wasn't impressionable you couldn't convince me to do something that stuck to this day my wife has had to deconstruct some of my stubbornness i didn't even realize was incredible stubbornness it's just something that you you brought up with so to me that stuff doesn't bother me and it's it's so the voices of others don't shake you quite they can't mentally shake your like psychological stability no they they haven't i i think when it got probably at its worst point was in combination with being unable to perform well in over the board play but that was also self driven i wasn't performing poorly because i was getting comments but because i was performing poorly the comments got to me more the cycle was sort of in in the opposite direction and that that was probably the most frustrating people have said some vile things to me you know about my whole indonesia thing oh this is good this is gonna give the anarchists and lee chees some some people oh i see let's go to india what's the indonesia thing yeah the way you said okay maybe we don't wanna talk about it no no it's but let's let's talk about it it's it's it's totally fine i who did you kill i i was gonna say i wish but i'm not even sure i can make a joke like that yeah i so the indonesia thing was i was streaming chess mhmm on chess dot com i might add and i got booted up for a ten minute game just a random account from indonesia that was the flag now mind you on these websites you can pick your flag it can be from wherever you don't there's not geotracing you can change it i was like okay account from indonesia and as always i looked at the account because it was a untitled high rated account and i looked through the games win rate was suspiciously high average accuracy was suspiciously high okay i think this is a cheater i said it out loud it's not the first time i've played cheaters on stream and i said okay i'm still gonna play let's see what happens the game was not crazy suspicious but definitely suspicious a few critical moments where i just clearly thought i had a good position and then the person or the bot played some move that just killed my hopes mhmm and i lost so okay i lost and i wrote to the chess dot com fair play team like behind the scenes i wasn't even saying anything publicly on stream and the guy got banned mhmm it was cheater so that night uh-oh right before i'm going to sleep because indonesia is twelve hours ahead of new york go on my twitter the hell is going on i see hundreds of responses to my recent tweets levy you gotta check facebook man you gotta check facebook like so you gotta here's a link so allegedly that account belonged to an older gentleman and his son made a facebook post that said my dad played a big streamer in chess gotham chess and gotham got mad he lost my dad so his community mass reported my dad and he was banned for cheating mhmm oh it went viral oh no did you know that indonesia has the fourth largest population in the world i didn't know i learned it the hard way interesting tens of thousands of dms every second wow instagram dms because i had my dms open i was never afraid of that stuff my youtube videos went from ninety nine percent of upvote downvote to fifty fifty fifty oh wow they swarmed my account negative oh boy all all play him again you i i mean i i don't know how much swearing there is on this podcast but i mean it was just all sorts of all the fucking swearing you were they just everything ruthless the the vicious they were gonna kill me they were going to rape my family they were going to they were contacting people i followed on instagram they were contacting them and telling them crazy things it was i'm not joking it was tens of thousands of people every minute it was unbelievable and i didn't know what to do because the guy cheated i was in the right yeah people how certain were you that he cheated hundred percent okay one hundred i mean okay i don't know if you can say hundred percent but but suggest dot com had also had a suspicion they what because they have like good they have like good detection algorithms yes danny wrench would be able to i legitimately know nothing about the behind the scenes because it's only kind of tech people but one one thing i did not realize was that this account whether it was the son playing or the father playing we will not know we don't know who played it could have been the son it could have been the dad covering for him whatever but at some point that account won twenty seven games in a row at ninety five percent accuracy i mean even magnus can't do that even you know this took a month this story took one month from start to finish first i had to work with a like a media company to geoblock my content in indonesia on youtube so indonesians could not see my channel oh so you you didn't wanna like lean into it go full donald trump no no let's let's because you're in the right you feel like you're in the right you as far as you know you're in the right yeah and i hated watching all my work burn to the ground like oh you you felt it was being yeah and i'm one thing i'm learning about myself is i'm not a good crisis actor i need someone to like slap me so i don't do something emotional in the moment when crisis is ongoing what what would be the emotional act that's not productive there partnering with an mcn that makes you give away a bunch of your revenue and then when you break with them i wasn't monetized for a week it was a very big decision to plug in i think they're called mcns but what are they sorry i don't what are mcns like we there's there's specialized agencies that work behind the scenes with youtube yeah that if you connect your account they say they can give you certain ad benefits they can geo block your content they which you can't do normally they have certain perks that only youtube allows behind the scenes you pay them ten percent of your monthly ad revenue mhmm but they claim to do a handful of things for you i just needed them to geoblock my content i i just didn't i didn't didn't care how much money i was going to give away per month but well so why geo block it you just didn't like the the down boarding yeah i didn't want you wanted positivity like you're being educational you're i mean they're like you do a bit of shit talking but it's more like fun and easygoing you didn't want this kind of viciousness yeah my comment section was just being completely flooded like they were destroying my channel and to be honest maybe all of the views and the down votes out of would have actually been beneficial maybe men my videos would have actually started getting recommended to more people yeah but i'm a person this is it all goes back to the same thing got to you yeah this was like i was just watching it and i'm like this is not fair this is i don't i don't know what to do so i'm gonna stop this as much as i can they still got through they have vpn and they were like you asshole well you don't think we have vpn in indonesia it was this whole you know it was this whole thing this father and son got invited to every major news network i'm not joking they got invited to the major podcast they like to say that joe rogan of indonesia yeah dedi corbusier is this mentalist he's a bald guy very fun guy mhmm he had them and that's when the indonesian chess federation stepped in the thing is nobody who was harassing me knows anything about chess mhmm they just saw the story and long story short they brought in a sponsor the guy played a strong one of the strongest chess players in the country who also happens to be a woman irene sukhander she's like twenty four hundred international master she crushed him because his actual playing strength is thirteen hundred fourteen hundred you something like that he still got paid because there was a winning price fund a losing price fund and we never heard from him again and that was the whole source that was that was why i had to shut down all of my social media to dms and dm requests and even notifications like i don't get notifications unless it's someone i follow but see stuff like that doesn't often get resolved in this kind of clear way no it doesn't could've been so you got lucky there that there's a conclusion to this yeah somebody got views somebody got money and i never got i never got many apologies what did you learn from that experience about yourself about about the internet i think first and foremost i learned that every moment you are live or broadcasting can be completely blown out of proportion you have to be real careful and i can't actively think about that unfortunately even when i'm streaming i've had other instances where things come back to bite i've even had these moments live on stream i feel like i said something too sarcastically to somebody and i don't know how their day is going it might ruin their whole day you know god god knows what you have these moments of regret where you want your personality to shine through and you wanna entertain at least you're thinking at what cost if i make a joke to a to a viewer that suddenly the whole chat is laughing at them what if that puts them in a deep dark place and again it's so it all comes back to this one on one thing for me because i'm a human i would hate to put another person into that situation if i would much rather get a drink with somebody than than but it's all kind of part of this act and you wanna make jokes and i also learned i'm a horrible crisis actor so i have no patience but i think that's normal in twenty twenty two everything is immediate mhmm we can barely sit think let time go by it makes me sad because i think that kind of stuff can destroy good people that's what makes you sad yeah well one of the things we discussed just here before recording which i i'm also i've talked about this on stream i'm very open with this type of stuff is over the i think for me a lot of that comes down to just a lack of control of the of the narrative that's that phrase is kinda messy it can be used for political stuff but i i i hate when i say things and they get completely misconstrued or they are completely misinterpreted and i can't imagine being in your shoes because again i do chess you cannot really you can clip me saying something about a chess game out of context then it's hilarious you know it it's it's dumb it's it's nothing it's not an attack on on on me or or or something that i said it's not an attack on kind of more more similarly to to what you were describing and you don't you don't say you don't say stuff like that like ridiculous you don't say ridiculous shit about yourself oh i do i do i do and you don't feel like that could be made i isn't this the same guy that said x maybe may maybe i i either haven't said enough of those things or there's no moments in i don't have three four hour open conversations with other humans and i'm pretty sure if i did there would be more of that that stuff out there but it that's probably what it is it's just a lack of it's a lack of being able to kind of control what is actually reality and and that that is very frustrating and yeah the you you're right i mean there is a sense that there's not enough motivation for people to attack you you're ultimately adding a lot of positive stuff to the world and when you get into more political topics there's people that who are hurting who have a lot of anger in their hearts and they wanna direct it towards you so then they need ammunition and ammunition comes in the way of like clips from the past so i'm sure that you i'm pretty sure you already have clips like that it's just there's not people that really have anger to direct towards you ultimately you're adding a lot of good stuff to the world and so yeah but it's man the the viciousness of human beings under the veil of anonymity at scale can be really painful so that that's i guess that's the curse the challenge of being a creator on youtube and so on on on on twitch yeah when you talked about retiring you i i think you tweeted about retiring from chess i mean the video yeah i tweeted it's my value to the world the tweet or the video just the both yeah i'm retiring from all competitive chess events my preparation is outmatched my calculation skills are too flawed and most importantly my anxiety is beyond repair i physically and emotionally cannot do it anymore yeah what was the hardest thing what was the hardest thing about competing like we can you can you elaborate on that yeah i think it separated into phases of my life so after being a creator and coming back and playing over the board and making recaps of all my games i think the constant feeling that i had at the board was a kid who hadn't studied enough for a test which is a very unique type of anxiety and during the game it was just self hatred like good moves did not feel as good as how bad bad moves felt and bad moments and and then underneath that you're saying there's a sense that i did not prepare well enough oh unquestionably so my i'm an international master but there's international masters now who are eleven i got the title when i was twenty two which is late it might not sound like it's late but it it's really late and i quit chess multiple times when i was a teenager if i hadn't one of my parents was like sit down this is the only thing that you're good at focus on it yep maybe i would have been grand master but that's that's life right and i would come back to chess at various points in my life when i felt more mature i felt more ready and i felt more motivated it was all me i never i had one coach when i was maybe about ten i never listened to the guy great guy like he emailed me even recently just wanting to catch up which i thought was adorable because i'm like i'm like i don't even know if he knows that youtube chess exists he's in his seventies he's just he's just like a nice older guy yeah and he would come to my house we would have dinner and my grandma would make us food and he would tell her that i'm brilliant but i never work and i have so much potential if only i ever worked at all one minute on anything i just played speed games online and and i but did he did he speak the truth there like could you have worked more i could have worked more for sure yeah absolutely when you listen to magnus who doesn't he seems like he doesn't work either he works he might work in different ways but i i think for him it's also obsession again love it's it's everything it's he might read a book he doesn't consider it work it's work he's getting information in and he's learning something it might just be easier for him to learn than for me for example or for anybody it just everybody learns and absorbs things differently so i i would come back to chess and the best run of my life that i had was in twenty sixteen where i basically while teaching a chess program scholastic chess program i told all the parents hey so for these four months i wanna stop doing private lessons and i'm gonna go travel and play tournaments because i wanna become an international master finally mhmm finally mhmm twenty years old this is in two thousand sixteen like can can you help me raise some money these are all managing directors these are lawyers these are seven figure eight figure households and they contributed and i kept a blog and then i worked just six hours seven hours every day like studying all the opening trends all of the new ideas reading the books analyzing my own games playing my own speed games and analyzing them training every day and that year i went from twenty two forty over the board to twenty four zero four with two of the three norms as they call them which are basically tournament performances mhmm like you perform at a certain level not too complicated so i i got almost everything i needed to be an i'm but i just slipped up at the very end and twenty seventeen i didn't play chess but in twenty eighteen i came back once again with a vengeance i started playing in the summer once again and i went up up up to my peak but then something interesting happened my life mission was accomplished i never wanted or thought i could be a grand master yeah i wanted to be an international master and the adrenaline dump of hitting the i am title i just stopped working completely i just completely stopped working i i couldn't and the second i started falling i couldn't stop yeah and i spent the rest of the summer just tanking and i said fuck this i'm i made my i made my i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna fuck off someplace and whatever i'll be i'm it doesn't matter but when i play games online i mean i destroy grandmasters all the time like dynamically dynamics in chess are just complex positions with all sorts of calculation attacking defending like very forcing lines i think it's my best strength i think i'm easily grand master level so that you have the capacity to be grand master hundred percent like if i if if if the work was put in if the work was put in and i i was not doing my current career if i just train full time i think i could do it do you have a desire to be a grand master did you have a desire you said i didn't really want like the main goal was in international master which by the way is really interesting just i've i've talked to olympic athletes the crash after the gold medal is fascinating yeah i didn't get gold but for me that was my goal that was your goal i mean it doesn't matter it's the goal yep it takes a very very special person to not be destroyed by the gold mhmm and continue the dominance yeah it's to to continue growing to continue i mean it's hard to that's why they talk about it's hard to be a champion and defend your championships or whatever the goal is to to achieve the goal and stick to like yeah hold broke me it broke you yep so you have the capacity to be a grand master have you ever thought by the way is there still possible for you or you're fully dedicated now to the love of creating and analyzing this game i i don't think i'm going to do what i do right now forever so well you're gonna die one day right just a heads up yes yes yes yes i once cried when i realized that it was at a funeral it was very sad that's another entirely separate rabbit hole to go down which is when when did this happen yeah just a couple years ago yeah it was rough really were able to like like that the realization really hit you like fuck this this ends yeah i'm the kind of person who i have my active thoughts in my brain of things i have to get done and the more of those the better because i'll my brain will walk me off a cliff not the physical body the brain itself will walk off a cliff spinning in circles so i try to keep myself as active as possible on tasks i have to do it's good and i'm busy it's good at the scale i am because you can't really rest a whole lot but yes that was i have these moments in my life where i have realizations of past fuck ups or things i like i really have to do that i've been like really doing poorly or things like this mhmm massive existential things that just hit me like a just like a bus there's several things tricky about it so because i meditate on death a lot like in this conversation i imagine this is the last thing both you and i do just and we're gonna die after this so you meditate on that but then you also have to i think what hits people really hard is the realization that life moves on not only does it just end for you but most people will be like they'll you know in your case they'll tweet it's like oh he's so great after there'll be so much outpouring there'd be outpouring of love and so on for a day and then it moves on yeah and the you know the new trees grow new bridges are built and then eventually human civilization ends or moves over to mars and so on and you'll be forgotten completely but that that for most people come right away like you you get a cancer diagnosis or something like that and it's like doesn't anyone else know that i'm going to die does anyone else care yeah like nobody gives a shit i mean they do i mean there's love there but like not in in a dramatic way that you would somehow deep inside hope for that the world would stop because your life is facing this catastrophic event so yeah yeah but i think ultimately what you could channel that realization into appreciation of the current moment is just the people you love and sharing love with them as intensely as possible experiencing every moment as intensely as possible because eventually there'll be a last moment and after that there'll be no more moments that's sort of what i do yeah yeah i try to channel all of that into sorry i don't use these fancy microphones in in my own you look uncomfortable it's it's not your fault it's not your fault levi with this microphone no with this quite with this line of conversation oh i'm playing therapist i don't know if i'm uncomfortable i just i don't know if i have a lot to say sometimes i just listen yeah like sometimes i'm intimidated like if you say a lot of good things and i'm like shit what am i gonna say like at the end of it yeah yeah on this on this subject especially i'm like that's sort of what i there's nothing alright what do you think happens after we die oh man no that's a rhetorical question what were we talking about grandmaster grandmaster so how hard is it to reach what what are the what are the requirements for grandmaster by the way because yeah and what are the requirements for international master you mentioned a few requirements and so on yes so the first one is you have to know how to use a shure mic and an arm slowly you weren't impressed by the shure microphone by the way for the for people listening we're using this s m shure sm seven b that a lot of podcasters use i don't know why and michael jackson on thriller which grimes told me really that's why i think it looked a little different but it's it's the same wow underneath it a few musicians used it in studio i don't know where it became popular as a as a podcasting microphone because i think most broadcasters use condenser mics that look like really fancy yep this looks a little no this one's great it sounds really really good and i told you before that i wanted to use it but it requires a external dashboard of some sort and i'm way too lazy to learn how to do it and my microphone doesn't sound that bad for youtube and for for twitch but this is a long term i still have to figure out how to stream stuff i'm not i haven't figured that out because you want to go down into the world of twitch no i don't okay i don't you just wanna learn how to do it just in case no for no not twitch do you know what we have over there so first of all yes it is it's like a i feel like the hobbit going into like a mortar like i i i yeah twitch is a is a very intense world but the there is useful cases when you should have your microphone work with like the different the processing chain work in real time mhmm so you can do like interviews and also i play video i try to play a video game once a month so i've done that like three times already so stream that kind of stuff for like for like an hour like play skyrim i like i love playing skyrim i actually love the idea i haven't done that yet but apparently in skyrim you can turn off the monsters and you can just walk around so i love the idea of just walking around in skyrim for a couple hours and just like because it's beautiful nature i see have you do you know anything about those the sea outside i i know i know little about skyrim but so it's it's kinda like chat now yeah it's it's just beautiful worlds so there's games that are able to create this sense of you know the way you feel when you go hiking the sense of nature yeah there it's not that they're ultra realistic but they capture some majestic aspect of nature i think some of it is also music something peaceful mhmm thick old timey medieval type of music and just the trees like the wind like and you could and then there's in the in the distance there's the mountains and you can like you have a sense of history that the nature gives you you have a sense of space like this you're like this tiny little creature and there's this big world all around you i don't know how video that's like an art for a video game to create that it's not just about the monsters in front of you yeah it's about this world and this feeling of a world so i can just walk around and enjoy it i get asked this question a lot why don't why don't i stream more video games yes and i didn't know that such video games first of all existed i thought it was mostly just various sci fi ish characters and shooting and objectives yeah yeah yeah i've played overwatch on stream it's the it's the only video game i actually played a lot and got decent at and i couldn't play it on stream anymore because my teammates would use racial slurs in the voice chat yeah so that is i will i one of the because i i've been thinking of talking to a few streamers and they do they're a little bit i i don't know as far as they the the that community broadly does use racial slurs and seem to make them okay but for the ones i would talk to are a little bit they're just harsh in general in in the intensity of language and i i don't know what to feel like i don't wanna be the guy who says like kids these days with their with their mean language on the internet like you wanna kind of adapt to the different communities but at the same time there is there's lines that you can cross right like if you make everything into a joke because that's what they kinda do everything ends in lol everything is funny yep and that becomes once again a lubricant that it's like a slippery slope that takes you to a place where you actually make pretty mean ideas even evil ideas okay because the star is a joke and so i mean you start getting into the territory of i mean because i've been reading a lot on hitler and and stalin and so on and you'll see those kinds of topic come up in that community and it's like oof they have a very different perspective on that stuff to them it's just a fun fun joke fun time and i i and and i see that the contrast of that with call of duty where you're where you're shooting and i i love shooting and killing things in video games but there's a slippery slope there too because then just having visited the front in ukraine you get to see the real killing of people and you see how one can lead to another it it's non obvious but there's there's something that happens in video games where you're like well this is not reality the same kind of things happens in war well the people on the other side aren't really human it it does become a kind of video game and that that same mechanism i feel like i wanna be cautious about our brain going down that road so yeah i i i do worry about that community but there are video games that don't have such communities around them i think skyrim i don't think skyrim is an online component of people minecraft i think is relatively civil from what i've seen interesting a good community i think it's a lot of lot of right now it's booming it's a lot of young creators who are all seemingly quite close and i think the community then extends to social media some of them are intense but who isn't and i think i think they foster a more or less kind of good group of folks but no i i i completely agree i think a lot of that stuff and combined with the anonymity stuff that we mentioned earlier totally dehumanizes the way people interact with each other and it's yeah it's scary i don't i don't know combine that with two years of some people barely going outside yeah with covid yeah it's not a good mix it's not a good mix at all i mean you'd like to think that folks it's like in their teenage years kinda go through those and they mature out of it and stuff so like they they they they start to realize the weight of their words like that's my hope but we're all trying to figure that out how the internet has changed youth like easy access to porn easy access to like some dark communities yeah where dark ideas breed i don't know but then again i trust in the goodness and the intelligence of people at the end of the day and i think kids will now i sound like an old man but it's it's good for kids to play with different ideas and then they grow out of it hopefully but then you have to have parents and good school and like good friends that kinda calm out in their bullshit you need that if you're stuck in inside under anonymity maybe you don't have some of those signals because these days with their internet i had to go through this it's kind of what i what i mentioned so i i didn't have two divorced my my parents were divorced i didn't have two households i had three so i had what was the third one so i went to school most of my childhood in a town where my grandmother lived and she was kind of like the switzerland so i would be with her and my mom would come with me there half the week dad would take me to his place for the other half of the school week and they my parents would split weekends my mom's weekends were in new york where she my stepdad was and that that family sold three houses so grandma your dad's mom and then and then yeah mom so step siblings yeah there and there new people there and there extended family there and there and also at grandma's where i would come anytime i had a conflict and when i was twelve and thirteen and being just a total lunatic emotional manipulator of all folks in my family which teenager rebelling and also having to deal with three different households and i mean i carried a backpack the same backpack literally that i not the physical one but what's inside of it that i carried like when i came here to record the episode and and have my stuff in the hotel a backpack with a laptop a bunch of clothes a bunch of other things that i need throughout the week deodorant things like that i mean of course you start getting that stuff in all all the houses but the that was the way i lived for some of the most important developmental years of my life and who knows if i had too much of what we're describing one sprinkle of this too much one sprinkle of this too much if i had someone influence me in a negative way luckily i managed to steer clear a lot of of a lot of it and yeah how did you not get into trouble with the internet meaning like how did you no what was your experience with the internet so i i was having to move a lot having to have multiple households just psychologically different difficult upbringing i yeah it was it was extremely tough i it's hard to speak about it now because i'm in a completely different mental state i don't even remember some of like those moments but it sounds like a different person yeah exact that's exactly how it feels but i i remember i had a big video game addiction just like most teenagers i wanna say teenagers but probably teenage boys but i'm not i don't know i i don't know how addicted teenage girls are to to video games yeah i i didn't on that i definitely look back on things that i did in certain instances like well i was a teenager that was stupid oh i scammed somebody in some video game oh that was you know i was oh that's hilarious like and and just the i was just an idiot teenager like i didn't do anything unforgivable luckily and for the most part just kinda went about my life and i somehow got older and started getting more independent and stopped playing video games and to be honest with you i i i would love to sit here and say i have some sort of logical explanation of why i am the person i am today but i think you need elements of the right upbringing and teenager where i almost got i almost got killed by some gang members that's a very exaggerated story but i was in a park in new york city and i got into it with a kid whose brother was in a notorious gang of that neighborhood and he told me he brother was gonna come and and kill me basically over a stolen basketball and and i was i was gonna fight this kid because i was fourteen you know he stole my basketball of course i'm gonna fight this kid this kid was like twelve he had a pierced tongue yeah like this wasn't a joke yeah this kid was from a totally different way of life and his brother did show up but but his brother was like oh my god what's this kid's like i was a i was a little teenager i wasn't a big now fourteen year olds are six feet tall maybe something would happen to me but i was a little kid and it was just like really but looking back at that is crazy because i definitely had some of these moments in new york city more than anywhere else because it's such a big place but luck you need some you need some luck yeah the it's it's kinda funny that there's certain moments in life on which the entire trajectory of your life can turn yeah and then they're all like in that case nothing happened but you know i i most intensely feel this when i get almost run over by a car kinda thing how many times have you almost get run over by a car i don't know maybe it happened like twice in my life oh okay with that kind of stuff like when somebody runs a red light yeah that that happened to me here in austin you realize oh shit that was mhmm like your life flashes before your eyes and though those moments can turn and then there's more meeting certain people where you meet them and then for the positive they're like wow this this moment of inspiration like wow this is possible wow this this kind of person can exist maybe i can be that kind of person too so yeah those things can like change the direction but maybe not maybe they just reveal something that was already there and the momentum is always carrying you forward into a thing that you are always gonna end up in yeah i wonder about that speaking of teens doing stupid things let's let's return to the magnus hans saga i know yeah how did it start who is hans niemann who is magnus carlsen how did it start there's three games it started in miami yeah a a good a good background story is magnus carlsen is the arguable greatest player of all time very close i would say to to to garry kasparov world number one for now over ten years what's the top of his game you think like close to the top of his game right now after the most recent thing yes i think he has the uncanny ability of top athletes to absorb the bullshit and show oh yeah dad's home now yeah you know yeah run i was only trying seventy percent before that you know and and i think that's what he i think i really think that's what he showed i was in awe i i if magnus is playing in a tournament yes it's good for views to put him in my youtube thumbnails and make the video title about him if he does something brilliant but i was legitimately just blown away it wasn't even wasn't farming him for content it was this is unbelievable what he's doing to people and he has a point to prove hans is a i believe he's nineteen years old right now he's an american i don't know if prodigy is necessarily the right word prodigies you you know they're prodigies from very very young you don't in chess you don't become a prodigy at eighteen but he was always a good junior player he was always a very unique character like i met hans when he was eleven twelve years old he's this little kid just trash talking folks at the marshall chess club and he already had a reputation literally like he had a reputation with with with counselors with like and the truth is i was similar yeah i was kicked out of chess camp by one of the best chess grandmasters of all time arturia supoff i was in a chess camp when i was nine years old what did you do i was just an asshole yeah i was too strong so i helped other people with other work do you let your ego shine i was a kid i mean i wouldn't well you don't not every kid lets their ego shine but some do oh yes you did yeah hans does like there's interviews when he's young yeah where like he's kinda yes talking shit but it's entertaining yes what i try to stay away from is just yes i let my ego shine but i don't think i even knew what any of that was when i was younger yeah so it's just sort of i was just i was just a loud boisterous kid from a household where i wasn't paid attention to because i had three of them yeah so i just was like here's where i'm gonna show up and get my attention and arturia soupov he's a great great man i drove that man crazy he was like top five in the world at some point in the eighties and nineties he said it's either me or this kid oh wow so you really got to him yes he said i'm not gonna come back and teach camps unless it's me and i remember like going through this i have very vague distant memories of this my dad calling apologizing yeah and did it make you feel good that you got to a grandmaster no i felt horrible i felt guilty i felt guilty my whole life about that i very rarely feel proud of bad things or showed them yeah even things it's it gets to the point you feel guilty about things you didn't do that's why that's when your brain really goes crazy yeah i'm with you on that so okay so you can relate to young hans to young hans and he was like in and out of chess this is what i remember he was around the rating of twenty three hundred and i remember looking at some of his games in a tournament in philadelphia and i was like there was some game that he played and he didn't know the opening it was like a london which is a very popular opening some theoretical line i looked at him like woah he he didn't know that okay that's crazy and then i just kinda walked by and i saw him in a tournament a few months later and he did something very rare where in an open tournament not a tournament of ten players or everybody plays everybody open tournament randomized pairings depending on how many points you have he played nine grandmasters which is crazy that means he was performing so well so consistently that was where he got his first i am norm mhmm it's like oh here it is here comes that like boom of a young player where he gets mature he gets back into the game and he gets stronger i don't follow a whole lot pandemic happens and he starts streaming a bit and he's he's boisterous he's he's kind of like loud he's talking trash and he's gaining rating constantly he's just but so are a lot of people so you don't think much of it and then now you can go play over the board again live tournaments face to face as opposed to online events and he's like i'm a go to this tournament i'm gonna win it i'm gonna get my last gm norm and he does and then he's like alright my goal is this rating by the end of this year he gets it he just demolishes absolutely everybody and you're like this guy's over the board over the board you're like this guy's for real there's a lot of people like that if you look at the top juniors of the world it's crazy ali reza farooja twenty eight hundred vincent keimer twenty seven hundred a bunch of kids from india twenty seven hundred age or younger literally one or two years younger maybe maybe a little older by a year but it's just this wave and you're just hype for the guy yeah like this this is fucking awesome like we got we got a young american guy who shit talks every time he's on camera and he beats everybody he plays but then you start hearing sprinkles here and there maybe in some stream i think he he doesn't he doesn't get to play on chez dot com anymore yeah like chez dot com doesn't put that badge there on the account sometimes sometimes they just tell the player listen we know and the player's like alright you got me and that's it there's no conversation so there's like these sprinkles but people cheat online especially when they're young it's very you you know it's very captivating it's a very nice thing to do just to be clear i mean just to make explicit that the accusation and i i think it's proven but they're still being shady about it to the degree it's done is that he cheated on chess dot com when he was twelve twelve and sixteen that's what he said that's what he said that's what he admitted to but right now chess dot com put out a statement and now magnus put out a statement as well saying we think it's more than that and yeah i i've talked to danny because he wants to come on the podcast which i'm actually kind of interested in i think he's a a cool person and they're also doing some really interesting anti cheating stuff which to me from an algorithmic perspective is interesting but he is also the man like there's always in every field there's the institution so he represents the institution because chess dot com is the institution it's like in the olympic it's it's the ioc it's like i'm i'm you know i have to be i have i have to be careful no in chess fide is the institution fide okay yeah but dot com they've outgrown way more people actually know chez dot com way more people know me way more people know hikaru it's one of the reasons that where the power lies who has the most power interesting yeah chez dot com has the most power which power know maybe you and hakaro do do no to steer public opinion you know it's a very good question i have to think with my evil cap now what would happen if i'd rather you have the evil cap than than hikaru because i feel like he would really you know the the power absolute if the two of you ruled the world it'd be a problem you mean side by side or rivals yeah it would be like yeah as rivals there would definitely be a war it's one of the reasons i would i would i would not chuzbox him do you guys how much do you like each other or i mean do you admire each other as fellow as i tell you how i feel it's so entertaining well we should finish magnus hans yes that's then we should yes that's can just yes i know it's it's i feel like it just inside we don't wanna talk about it because it feels like it's been talked about so much i'm gonna i'm trying to give no for you just remember i for me it's even it's much less yeah and for the listener obviously listener zero yeah so like a like rogan asked me like so what what what's this i know i heard him even talking what what's this chest you know joe talked about the indonesia thing in in some super random small thing and that was a very funny moment for me i told him about this drama a few weeks ago and then he's like yeah this is interesting is it anal beads is that possible is that good i was like yeah i think it's possible is it i don't remember how drunk he were but this so even you know he's curious he doesn't really know but anyway cheating when he was twelve when he was sixteen right as he said he admitted yes to cheating online when he was twelve and sixteen yes but for timeline's sake let's just let's just do it this way he has a lot of over the board success but nobody really talks about the online cheating stuff it's sort of kinda kept low key couple hundred people maybe couple thousand people which sounds like a lot but it's not because there's millions of viewers know about this it's generally kept kind of low key because historically if you cheated online as a teenager you're not cheating over the board it's not possible you will get caught nobody has ever attempted it we've had over the board cheaters but not at the ultra elite level and so what happens is they play this tournament in miami and the first day hans loses three nothing this is important because on the very next day it's not like hans was destroying every every day the second day of the tournament he sits down game one versus magnus in their best of four and destroys him like he destroyed him made it look like i was playing in magnus's shoes you know the level difference it wouldn't have even like he it wasn't close of course we can argue it might be because of the maybe magnus knew something ahead of time there's obviously the psychological element not not important hans leaves they say interviewer says hans yesterday by the way horribly phrased interview question he goes matt he goes hans yesterday was terrible for you and today you start with a masterpiece what do you have to say chess speaks for itself walks away yeah argue you can argue it's cringe you can argue i thought it was cool and then the might the guy the guy then keeps asking a question with his arm extended because he's so shocked he doesn't know what to do like he he didn't even occur to him how ridiculous it looked to be asking and then not only does hans come back and loses the best of four he loses like two more games or maybe three i think he loses the next three games he then proceeds to lose every single best of four match for the rest of the tournament yeah he ends with zero points and a prize money of zero dollars they put up the graphic and he put niemann zero i think he got some minimum right so it's like wow this is like insane this guy comes out with this crazy interview and in my recap videos i was like the next time hans has success he has to stay away from the cameras don't let him talk just don't let him talk it's gonna be bad luck you know i'm joking around like next time he plays it's crazy he's gonna so that was the that was their kind of first interaction there they also there were some photos they were having fun playing on the beach i don't know whether they had a chessboard on the beach chess players are such bangs were sons yeah they were so they were still getting along i guess so yeah it's interesting because i talked to him at that time would he have mentioned something right i wonder what he would would have said if i asked him about hans because that was clueless did did anyone care about no no no nobody no no hans is not a super known entity right he became yes much more known he became probably a top five all time popular chess player in the last three weeks yeah so it's it's not there wasn't it wouldn't even be a woody question no you you don't know maybe magnus already kind of knew a lot of the top players it seems are coming out now and saying we already were suspicious yeah it seems like magnus might have known but maybe not enough to address it he still might not be willing to address it yes yeah but anyway so like so so yeah so totally horrible tournament performance after correct after hans beat then the annual tradition of the saint louis tournaments happens which is a strong field of players first for a fast tournament rapid and blitz and a classical tournament and the classical tournament is the sinquefield cup it's the it's named after rex sinquefield billionaire chess philanthropist and it's like saint louis chess club it's like a prestigious place it's this whole and a host of a prestigious tournament hall of fame is there for chess i don't know if it's us hall of fame or worldwide hall of fame but yeah it's it's the tournament countries play chess i didn't they do but you know we will i i don't know who determines where the hall of fame gets to be if we say it was the hall of fame okay one day some other part of the world's gonna be like actually it's over here yeah so basically what happens is we have a field set for the st field cup set it's the top ten players in the world some can't make it so okay you you get number eleven in there or something one of them can't come because of something related to coronavirus it's not it's not now we're gonna get a little asterisk on spotify because it was mentioned but get more info about covid nineteen so i don't know why he couldn't come but he couldn't come okay something happens he can't make it hans niemann is the replacement yeah at the time we didn't know this but now weeks later we knew magnus wanted to not play this is very important back then we didn't know apparently some other top players also didn't want to play they also were suspicious they also wanted increased anti cheating measures which by the way in chess are dog shit like do you give this little metal wand and you put it on the little ears body and there's apparently an argument a micro earpiece would not be caught something in the armpit vibrating would not be caught something in the shoe they don't make the players take their shoes off because it's too elitist you how are you gonna make players take their shoes off that's oh my god but if these things are out there or if anything was inside any other orifice correct yes i have to bring that up i mean i mean that to be honest yes that that that that is very truthful so if if nothing else this podcast is about honest and truth so i have to be complete like and transparency so what ends up happening in this same field cup is magnus ends up still playing but the anti cheat measures are not introduced so the first few games hans has a very very impressive first round game against levon aronian one of the best players in the world k draw he was pushing draw second game demolishes like a like a top player mamedi arif crushes him dominant opening but not like a perfect game you understand like it it was it was he made some inaccuracies here and there and he ended up winning in a complex game as game three happens versus versus magnus and not only does he beat magnus with the black pieces he dominates him from start to finish so in the opening magnus played something with white that he had maybe played once or twice before there was some big debate about it i'm not gonna get into it basically a very niche small thing that just he had never played in maybe a long game before with some sprinkled in venom that might get hans off guard mhmm hans proceeds to play like the first fifteen twenty moves absolutely perfectly and then converts the game into a slightly better end game and squeezes magnus to death basically beats magnus with black which nobody had done in years the same way magnus would have beaten other players then he goes and gives this interview which where he claims that he had looked at those first fifteen twenty moves right before the game basically he got lucky didn't he say he looked at something sim very similar no no he it was it was either similar or or literally that exact variation which is possible i've done that before one of my best wins of my life that morning i went you know i'm not prepared what if my opponent plays this queen's gambit accepted variation mhmm and i literally learned the first twelve moves he he didn't know move twelve i killed him mhmm okay like it just happens yeah unfortunately when you combine that with other small elements of the interview and now there's body language experts going all on this it was odd he gave an interview afterwards explaining his explaining various details of the game but not really explaining them that's the thing the standard chess player interview is you sit down you go something about the opening something about not oh yeah i looked at this right before the game and then you explain various symphonies and and and and compositions of variations things that went through your head things you were evaluating but hans' interviews are different so everything about him as a chess player already is different and his interviews are extremely strange and also different yeah that's fine but not when you combine it then with the world champion withdrawing right after you beat him mhmm and ghosting the entire chess world yeah so there there's a for people who haven't listened to it there's a kind of sloppiness to the way he analyzes the game like he's like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah like it's very because it's very obvious like what do you mean just completely winning here yeah i'm completely winning here and it's like i yeah i i just played perfect i i played perfect like there there's a sense of like but it also doesn't for me again a very outside spectator it doesn't raise any red flags that's just his personality he seems to really like to talk this way and plus this could be crazy but do you have a sense that he's more of an intuitive player versus like he's just not the kind of person that analyzes really well is it or is that a ridiculous notion well let's put it this way to succeed legitimately because obviously this is a cheating scandal at the end of the day at the twenty seven fifty eight twenty eight hundred level the upper echelon of chess you cannot be an intuitive player you can be a little bit more intuitive than a calculator and a concrete evaluator of positions meaning if i give you five seconds to play a move you're gonna choose the best move quickly those people are generally better at fast time controls but you have to be good at everything and what raised red flags in this interview was the fact that it was different than every other interview any human being ever gave at that level of chess particularly after beating magnus for the first time as a teenager which is a very small group of people and so so that's where it got weird and the very next day magnus withdraws from the event chessworld lights completely on fire for multiple weeks and chaos of tweets right that yeah that was that's the resignation no resignation was the tweet was i'm withdrawing for the tournament in saint louis i've always enjoyed playing here and i will in the future and then it's a clip of jose mourinho i cannot speak i choose not to speak if i speak i'm in big trouble i don't wanna be in big trouble yeah and that one that's some people nuts people said it's not even a cheating insinuation which was one of the theories another theory was someone in team magnus told hans what magnus was looking at and that's why hans learned those first fifteen moves which is so fucking stupid because magnus knows like five people not in not in his life but his team is five yeah it's very close knit group right yeah but to the outsider that sounds like a very legitimate theory how could how else can you explain hans said he knew before the game what was gonna happen magnus senses a mole he's not no by the way just just to just so i know like if that was forget the cheating aside if you knew doesn't matter how the opening your opponent is going to do they prepared is that a significant help to you if that opening is ultra sharp and requires basically the game to be on the knife's edge yeah yes meaning one mistake from can be fatal because then you can look up what the engine says and you can you can know everything you can know all the possibilities so even if your opponent goes off that engine path you will know how to punish it in this case what happened basically was magnus played a line that if completely optimally punished would have given hans a slightly better position and that's what happened but then he also demolished him in that later phase of the game yes and then okay so magnus designs goes silent the chess world goes crazy what else is interesting in that period of time hans' fourth round game of that tournament right after beating magnus was also just absolutely genius just an absolutely brilliant game which he failed to win but then after that game he also gives once again another interview where he's like this game was absolutely genius like this was i was just killing him from start to finish and like there was a moment he literally says oh yeah just gave him a piece like a full piece which is a substantial advantage to the other side and he starts explaining why the position is winning but in words not in chess moves not in specific concrete chess moves which is the way you're supposed to if you understand the position right so now there's this new theory that's being cultivated that the interviews are gonna be used as the evidence and beyond round four he just played like a a a good grand master mhmm and he lost two or three games maybe maybe two games and he drew the rest so he didn't win again like he beat the first two out of his first three games he beat mamadjarov he beat carlson mhmm and he also went on the attack himself he that was when he publicly admitted to cheating in an interview that he gave to the saint louis chess club that's when he said he has never cheated over the board then he said chess dot com has banned me from the global championship which is what i was invited to to play privately they banned me they didn't even ban me publicly mhmm and then he said and hikaru is is is is is on twitch every day you know saying things about me this and that and since then nothing tournament finishes somehow i don't know how we cut to the end of the tournament i really thought that it was gonna get called off but tournament ends hans hasn't said anything since then mhmm so because he still said was when's the last time he said that was the last text a tweet that he sent september seventh says hikaru wants to play the victim something like this they face each other again mhmm recently when was that what was that about they played in the online event of this meltwater champions chess tour which is a sixteen player tournament where everybody plays everybody first and after fifteen games the top eight make a knockout bracket mhmm and magnus played the game there was obviously a lot of hype prior for what was gonna happen in this game magnus plays one move and resigns actually i imagine he didn't wanna play one move i imagine he would have resigned the game as it was starting but i think some websites don't let you resign before you make one move because then the game isn't counted yeah so i think he didn't wanna play at all but he played one move and that made it even more epic i suppose and he resigned and that was that was that like so you still you you lose that game counts right oh game counts you lose the rating oh these online events unfortunately don't count for any sort of rating but on a tournament yeah you play one move yeah so he resigns and then how does the tournament still work out is the tournament already over so he made the eight does magnus still made the the top eight it was round five or like round six or something so it was halfway through the preliminary stage yeah it affected his standings but then after resigning that game magnus finished first in the bracket in the preliminaries and then he won the entire event there was a chance that they were gonna meet in the final but hans lost in the first round against the vietnamese strong player le quang leung and then magnus gave a short interview to the live broadcast where he said he would give a statement at the end of the tournament and then he did he gave a statement at the end of the tournament and now here we are the only other thing missing from this is the very intense scrutinization of all those over the board games that i mentioned earlier that hans dominated in so people are now going through all of his games that he played in tournaments and they're analyzing them with engines and they're saying he played exceptionally well and the debate is was he cheating or was he way too good already but underrated because he could have had incubated knowledge so he could have not played for a couple years was twenty seven hundred level but was playing people who are twenty four twenty five hundred well well over the i i see so not just over the board with the top level people like magnus but over the board in general yes before he got a chance to play in the super tournaments against the best players in the world he had to go to europe he was the most active chess player in twenty twenty one and he was quite dominant yes i think he played more over the board games than any player in twenty twenty one or twenty twenty two i think it's twenty twenty one and yes i think his rise was steeper than everybody yeah maybe with the exception of alderes of ferrugia who got the twenty eight hundred see i'd like to believe because he he talks about being very he just became obsessed with chess mhmm i i like stories like that me too i like stories of the underdog especially with the scarlet letter of having been a cheater in the past i like the idea of somebody who is flawed psychologically and ethically and just just a full fascinating personality and this somehow just becomes obsessed i mean similar to bobby fischer mhmm he's also a tortured soul also flawed also just chaotic all over the place you could see bobby fischer being somebody that might cheat when he was twelve on online chess right like if if it existed yeah actually i think in some podcasts like small chess podcasts i don't wanna i i like ben johnson so i i'm apologizing for calling it small but compared to like let's say alex friedman podcast it's oh what's what's what's this podcast it's it's perpetual chess it's kind of like oh i love perpetual chess what do you joke really dare you call yeah the the the way alright i'll show you because it does a lot of it it talks it makes me feel special let me see where is it perpetual chess he does like improver series yes yeah yeah yes yes yeah he's great ben i i forgot i'm so horrible with names his name is ben ben johnson yeah yeah it is ben johnson that's right yeah the perpetual chess podcast that's amazing see leggs mhmm when even individuals like myself who might have a large audience when i look at you you're at a you're you're just at a different level i don't expect you to be listening to chess podcast during the day just imagine you're general doing something to change the world or talking to some visionary people well i should say it you know i've been running a lot and i listen to podcasts a lot because they're such i love human beings excited about stuff that really energizes me and i've listened to a bunch of chess podcast i i'm really energized by your love of chess i really like yeah sorry i did forgot his name but ben johnson i love it when he talks to grandmasters i love this when he talks to the the the the regular folks for the improvers like to see how they balance life and chess and all that kind of stuff he's just pretty good at it he's like super excited and they talk about books yeah and they get excited about different books yes i mean it it it also gives me a sense of where the chess world is from a different perspective it's like people studying chess like what they get excited about how difficult it is yeah it's it's nice to get a sense of the community the language that's used because i did wanna have a bunch of conversations with folks about chess because i think it's a beautiful game and i i i think it's a beautiful community so that's that's one of the podcasts i listen to so yeah anyway he's he's great anyway you were saying why why'd you bring him up yes great podcast great podcast i only reason i thought of it and i used the word small no disrespect ben is because even that episode which he did with hans like it was a small episode it wasn't seen by mass audience yeah of chess and you did an episode with hans recently or no some time ago yeah and in that episode hans very openly is like bobby fischer was misunderstood and he was my idol oh wow said a couple of things like that and hans is an intense hans is an intense guy like i when i listen to hans i get a little anxious i just he brings out some sort of disturbance in my ecosystem yeah it's just i i yeah i can't really pin him down to like what what's going on there yeah as as a person who's trying to read people yeah it's it's difficult like i can i can this is the dark aspect he could be both the genius of bobby fischer and a genius cheater and you could see like there's something chaotic about him which makes him very appealing in that way yes so right now late september twenty twenty two the current environment is such that hans hasn't said anything in weeks and people are sort of dissecting every bit of circumstantial evidence that they can and they're trying to present the case i don't even know to who ultimately i guess it would be the fide cheating anti cheating commission or whatever it might be to you essentially i mean to people with the platform it it could be to to present convincing evidence to where the the people the people are convinced of one way or the other because you're for people who don't know and they should definitely follow gotham chess you've been on this you've covered it a lot and i'm sure if anything comes out you'll cover it more we've been quite balanced and thoughtful and kind of objective about the whole thing yeah so the reason for that is i understand the power that i wield with anything and if i say one sentence the wrong way i might be sending ten thousand people or more to go do something yeah and i hate that i want to present the evidence and i want the video to end and people go okay i understand not i'm a go i'm a go fuck someone up yeah you know what i mean like because that's and i also believe that even if hans even if hans is guilty this goes all the way back he's a human being yeah and you can argue that cheaters gotta be punished and you can argue that people who do things wrong you shouldn't feel any sort of compassion but i would hate to have the whole world pointing their fingers at me the entire world that i've known my entire life and even if i if i messed up there's still a world after chess there might still even be a world in chess i don't know but that stuff it doesn't make me doesn't make me feel good to present all of the circumstantial evidence in my videos and start being like yeah it looks you know so but at the same time you deeply care about chess and the chess community and there's some sense where was it you or was it magnus that said that cheating poses an existential threat it was magnus magnus said that mag i mean there is some aspect of truth to that which is like you know we the chess is in a state where bots chess engines are much better than humans yeah and we're living in a world where technology becomes easier and easier to integrate with with human beings whether you put it in some orifice or elsewhere and that that does pose a threat to to our ability to trust that a world champion is indeed a world champion that somebody we think is good is indeed good and so there is some aspect to the ecosystem that should punish cheating and perhaps over punish cheating and the other thing is in sport you can take peds and have bigger muscles bigger better reaction time but you still have to perform the action in a successful way there is still a chance you can lose if you take peds maybe in some sports the gap between non ped and ped user is significantly more noticeable but in chess if you cheat you play god yeah you decide when the game is over you can fake bad moves you can fake everything you can even if you're cheating quote unquote the right way you're gonna lose plenty of games to avoid getting detected so you can create bots that are twenty eight hundred like you can also just not listen if you know all the best moves but choose to play on your own like oh i made a mistake not a big deal you could yes bots are all at a different level but if you were to cheat that you you play god you can decide when you make your move and when the engine makes its move and if you know the top four lines of the engine you choose the fourth one so in hindsight people will analyze your game and they will go oh it wasn't perfect well no shit only the stupid cheaters play the top engine line the whole game by the way i'm not saying that this is what's happening here but but there's there's probably an excitement to playing god to to and get in the way with it like i know people i know adults grown adults who are successful in their fields and they they cheat they cheat in lessons they cheat in like i've i don't wanna say i've taught any may i may or may not have anyway for some reason one of them watches this and they know they're guilty and it happens it happens not just teenagers not just young adults but full grown adults will cheat when they play because it they think it helps them learn oh well that's exactly just a justification but i just meant like i'm it might not be just about winning it might also just feel good to have that power power like i bet you it's a drug oh yeah i mean like with a lot of criminals with a lot of criminals i feel like part like the like mass murderers would be serial killers i feel like a lot of it is they can get away with it the the fact that they like they've like everyone else is a sucker and they figured out how to do this evil thing and obviously cheating is nowhere close to that but the the but there's still a feeling of getting away with it yeah i wonder i think you're pretty objective on the whole thing where if you were a betting man what would you say is the probability and are you changing day by day in your head what's the probability that hans cheated over the board against magnus in the in in saint louis that's a tough one man have you even allowed yourself to to put a probability on it no not on that specific game because i think a lot of that game was affected by magnus' own psyche that was one of his worst games ever so he played poorly too magnus played which doesn't help his case yeah hans might have cheated in that game but we'll never know i i think day by day the evidence is slowly starting to show more and more that he's cheated it like like how magna said more than he said and more recently it's undeniable like right a lot of the statistics are there the problem is you can't prove you're not cheating yeah unless you strip naked like that site offered him a million bucks to like everything about the which site offered him a million bucks headline that said hans neiman has offered a million bucks in real and where i struggle to comprehend is how on earth he could pull it off and like i'm a guilty that my brain goes to guilt first and resent yeah resentment remorse guilt that kind of that trio magnus put out a statement as we speak yesterday saying dear chess world at the twenty twenty two singfield cup i made the unprecedented professional decision to withdraw from the tournament after my round three game against hans niemann a week later during the champions chess tour i resigned against hans niemann after playing only one move i know that my actions have frustrated many in the chess community i'm frustrated i want to play chess i want to continue to play chess at the highest level and the best events i believe that cheating in chess is a big deal and an existential threat to the game i also believe that chess organizers and all those who care about the sanctity of the game we love should seriously consider increasing security measures and methods of cheat detection for over the board chess when nieman was invited last minute to the twenty twenty two sinquefield cup i strongly considered withdrawing prior to the event i ultimately chose to play that's the thing you're referring to is that he can like now we know he was torn about the whole thing i believe that nieman has cheated more and more recently than he has publicly admitted his over the board progress has been unusual and throughout our game in saint phil cup i had the impression that he wasn't tense or even fully concentrating on the game in critical positions while outplaying me as black in a way i think only a handful of players can do this game contributed to changing my perspective he must do we must do something about cheating and for my part going forward i don't want to play against people that have cheated repeatedly in the past because i don't know what they're capable of doing in the future there's more than i would like to say unfortunately at this time i'm limited in what i can say without explicit permission from nieman to speak openly so far i have only been able to speak with my actions and those actions have stated clearly that i am not willing to play chess with niemann i hope that the truth on this matter comes out whatever it may be sincerely magnus carlsen world chess champion how would you sign off your statements if i was a world yeah no just say whatever lex fridman what would be the title yeah i don't know i think i would not even if i was a world champion i would just say lex or make up a title and i feel like i really fucked up in life if i have to tweet a statement as an image that's like when you get you've you're a politician and you got caught cheating on your wife like for many years in a row yes then i tweet an image i'm sorry for all the people i have hurt yeah and the people that believed in me and what whatever else and then i would sign world chess champion you know the most like the the modern way to give a statement what i thought magnus was gonna do yeah i thought he was gonna write on the recent scandal or my statement on the past few weeks twit longer what do you mean so you put a url oh yeah yeah so that's for tweets but it's unlimited characters it's not a hundred and forty know what that is can you explain that to me yeah so generally when a celebrity has a giant audience on twitter they will make their statement on social media and say what it is in a sentence yeah one line and then there's a link where does that link take you it's a website called twitlonger oh there's a text from website twitlonger yeah and that is where they write their statements that is what i was expecting when i saw this i haven't seen this before oh this this is i have a second i don't have one off the top of my head but it's it's like kanye kim kardashian breaking up they would use that streamers musicians yeah i don't think politicians use it because the it's just feeling yeah the the policy they use the image use my yeah myspace and facebook right yeah i will probably go see i i like i mean i'm not just being biased here just because i have a podcast i'm a huge fan of podcast i feel like i would go on a podcast to talk about it with somebody i trust so like long form and discuss it thought he was gonna do that too in fact i wanted to write him a message mhmm and be like i can be that that guy for you i have a very strange relationship with magnus because good bad i i don't i we've never interacted i very openly i don't wanna say use him for views because that is a very crude way of saying it yeah but if you wanted to insult my youtube channel that is what you would say so paul magnus is in a lot of videos thumb thumbnails or or videos not click baity but if he's playing in a tournament and he plays a great game he's going on that fucking thumbnail because oh because let's see he's the number one chess player very likely the greatest chess player of all time right plus he's exciting and youtube algorithm loves his name and people click on it oh do that do the best yeah but i don't know what the chicken or the egg is but the reason he loves it the reason people click on it is because he is an exciting personality he's an exciting chess player mhmm is there's something compelling about him yeah he's also he can he knows how to in a subtle dry wet humor way talk shit with the silences and all of that yes he knows he knows it he knows it he knows the whole game of it specifically to magnus my relationship with him we've never interacted and throughout the last couple of years he generally has interacted with hikaru as a competitor mhmm he has done some collabs with the botezes he obviously has talked to ludwig who's a very very big streamer and part of me regrets the fact that when i was smaller as a youtuber and a and a twitch streamer i'm sure i used to make jokes or some tweets at magnus like when magnus would tweet something i would try to respond so i could be the top reply because that was my social media i literally think i once responded to a magnus tweet and saying responding for engagement because it was some like it wasn't some controversial tweet yes it was just something funny and i went responding for engagement because i was just being a little bit of an idiot and i knew that if it got enough likes it would be at the top and people would see me my brand and just get to know me this is the type of please don't use the word brand but yes yes but yeah no and your worry is that he wouldn't take you seriously because he would take me seriously and if i was one of the best of all time and i saw some dude on youtube just kind of being a moron and i'm all over his thumbnails i can imagine he has a very legitimate case i appreciate your humility and self critical nature but one of the realities with people like him is he the they he wouldn't hold a grudge or not treat you seriously i'm pretty sure he's a he's a fan i'm he's a big support he doesn't watch youtube videos i think of that i barely watch youtube videos i think of chess like he might watch like more fun chess adjacent stuff but he just doesn't it's it's not for him so i'm pretty sure he knows of you and likes you and your commenting on stuff has zero effect on his belief which is funny that's something you think about now you you're a perfect you're well respected like you're a lot of people mention you as a person who's like okay this person's legit which is an important thing it's not just an entertainer it's not just a shit talker and so on this person does is is a great educator great fan and student of chess a great player himself so all of those components and so yeah you're definitely a good person and on this particular aspect i've been very objective i understand that i'm nowhere near perfect i don't i'm not a different person on camera or off camera i will say it like it is maybe on twitch you gotta you gotta dig in the mud there a little bit more a lot more sarcastic a lot more brash and whatnot but you meet me in a taco place and i'll talk with you the same way i might if it was a video just that you may not you may not consider me just a random guy at a taco place and that's why i think about the stuff with specific to magnus and it's one of the reasons i don't reach out to him directly ever i've i never have i've never dm'd him on instagram hoping for a response never i've never even reached out to anyone on his team trying to get the conversation very candid with him which i think it would be i even barely reached out to guys in the top ten like top fifteen only recently started pushing myself more to do that and i even in my intro messages to them preemptively say something like you might think i'm some idiot you might not be totally wrong yes but like i think this would be a good conversation and give it a shot and i've been surprised i've been ignored by a few but some said oh yeah i've seen your stuff generally a fan like no problem i was actually really blown away this youtube channel levidov chess it's a russian chess channel and i think the last name of the guy is the name of the channel is named after ilya levidov who has some sort of managerial role in the russian chess federation and this channel has interviewed some of the greatest players of all time they have interviews with the modern best russian players in kasparov karpov kramnik you name these guys from russian chess history it's unbelievable i just thought this was a channel of just unbelievably well respected chess players and legion of fans that were longtime chess fans and i mentioned them very briefly in the youtube video and that little clip went into their next community event and the founder of the channel went on this two minute beautiful description of why he liked me and how he only watched my channel as a beginner and how i have a natural voice and how if i talked about cards i would have a millions a hundred million subscribers just all this really kind stuff that in my mind i thought was either undeserved or i i just never fathomed that yeah yeah i mean you you said you certainly should not feel as deserved as you should have a humility about that kind of stuff but i think that is the thing that works over time it's like reputation spreads which is like if if one person likes you and they tell you to other people and it kinda spreads and over time you have one conversation with the top ten like a like a super grand master and they they say nice things about you and it just kinda spreads because i've been very surprised in all walks of life like i'm you know this this really gets me this makes me happy honestly because like people ask me like how i get guests and so on and it just seems honestly just be a good person and like a real person and honest and it just kinda spreads the word word-of-mouth it it just you know even coming here i almost didn't reach out what do you mean i had seen you i'd never talked to a a a chess person and i've watched a lot of i've watched some of the things start to finish especially if the guest i'm really interested in like george st pierre i'll watch that guy do whatever yeah exactly i'll i'll watch him do basically anything like make an omelette or something yeah i i i love listening to him some of the other things i i i i've listened to as well and i noticed that neither well to me you you obviously and and joe are the two biggest podcasters i don't know if that's like factual i don't know if some influencer has some pod podcast but you guys interview folks that i listen to more more often than anybody else and when magnus came on i was like oh this is that's amazing you know i i don't even know how i would reach out to someone like you it just seems like a a a limp like climbing a mountain and then a couple days later and i i even in that episode wanted to write but i didn't know how like do i make a youtube comment i don't want that i'm a little like i'm clout chasing on the magnus episode then you talked to the botesses and i said oh what's this i shouldn't overthink it yeah like you know i so i just said alright fuck it i'll i'll just write a comment and you're like yeah i'd love to have you on i was shocked i didn't even you responded just within a couple hours or something and yeah yeah i loved it man i mean it was an honor it's a good way to connect i also like on live streams i'll watch i try to resist commenting but you know i'll watch some some even smaller channels like i'll get super excited by by them and connect in that way there's an intimacy to that man youtube is beautiful i don't know anything about twitch maybe it's similar to know anything about it but youtube has ruin you there is an intimacy like especially if it's live i don't know what that is but if it's live they're like right there you you can just like reach out and say hello yes cool it's like really i don't know i'm just happy to live in this time when you could connect with people in that way there is an intimacy that's why i love podcasts too i i listen to people and i feel like they're my friend it's cool it's a cool it's a cool feeling it makes you feel less lonely in this world like you have a lifelong companion especially like people that do a podcast for many many years i'm like we've been you've gone through all the ups and downs of life together with a creator with a with a podcast or with anything it's cool i don't know it's a it it makes it it's surprisingly intimate a one way friendships of course for nature right i don't know there's there's there there's some negatives that people definitely describe the word that gets used a lot is parasocial you think you you like the viewer will think that the the streamer or the youtuber knows them or owes them something or has some they have a bigger connection than they do but you know what actually because sorry to interrupt i have to look maybe you can explain to me i've heard this term parasocial a lot i've been meaning to look it up might as well look it up well in live yeah sure sure sure parasocial interaction psi refers is this a new term like because i have just started listening hearing it like the last yeah i think it's year or so yeah parasocial interaction psi refers to a kind of psychological relationship experienced by an audience in their mediated encounters with performance in the mass media particularly on television and on online platforms viewers or listeners come to consider media personalities as friends despite having no limited interaction with oh shit that's a term for a thing i've been referring to interesting the term was coined by donald horton and richard wall in nineteen fifty six wow when there was like very limited media wow i guess tv and radio stuff yeah yeah parasocial interaction and exposure that gamers interested in the persona become a parasocial relationship after repeated exposure to the media yeah okay what's the downside bro what's what's okay oh well i can tell you the downside the downside is is people thinking they're in relationships with streamers and stalking them that's oh the stalking part but the relationship is like i mean okay you mean like actual relationship like like waking up and saying how are you doing like in your head to them yeah no but that might be an extension more like yeah getting mad they don't respond to you in anytime you're in the stream or that convincing yourself the other person wants you and you need to go to them so you need to find where they are like this has happened the the some of the biggest female streamers have reported that that they get stalked and harassed for months and that's born out of this this on a very small scale is you come into a a stream every so often and give an update about your academic career mhmm that's not so bad i i was gonna mention i've streamed on twitch for years and i watched people have kids like people will come in over the course of months and say hey man you know i just finished i just took the bar exam yo man like i'm having my first kid and that's crazy that's that's amazing yeah but if they do it in a healthy way that's one thing but i there's always gonna be downsized but most of it is beautiful man i have i have very i have i guess parasocial relationships of people that take it a little too far but it's all love you also have a fundamental belief and hope in people to be good yeah yeah yeah and i i've been you know i i haven't gotten in trouble with it yet that's that's good you know me too i've interacted with plenty of people in person and no one's been negative so it's and i've even gone to a war zone there i can't there's no there hasn't been people have been very i don't know people have only surprised me in the positive direction in the depth of the the capacity they have for compassion do we okay so now we're in this weird place with the cheating can can i ask you a question about how it's possible to cheat like if you and i you know the conversation you're gonna have with magus we're gonna have we're gonna play chess if we're we're trying to figure out how can you beat him what are the different ways do you think over the board chess what are the ways she yeah that's where i lose the thread because i don't know see that's what i immediately went to it's like the engineering challenge of cheating right well that's because that's like how you're good at that i mean you're not good at creating cheating in over the worst situation i'm just saying you your brain works differently i just choose to not even like i can't entertain that i i can come up with some bullshit but it it's not gonna be anywhere else your mind is not like immediately attracted to pulling at that thread of like how would you fuck with the system yeah my mind stops at that would have to be a really sophisticated thing and that's it it doesn't go any further my brain everyday thinks about the best way to compartmentalize chess into a digestible format and put it out into content chess that's what i think on the board chess not cheating yeah i just think about youtube i just think about that that's currently where my mind is fully focused i'm also working on like a a book so so that's what you're thinking yes see for me because i've built chess engines mhmm that that without understanding chess much as like you know as anyone does who's interested in ai you build all kinds of systems that do all kinds of stuff and chess is just an easy game like it starts with othello goes up to chess and go there's it's just a great benchmark a great place to explore different ai algorithms from search to machine learning and so on but to me cheating is like it's it's a similar kind of ideas well if i make it a board instead of eight by eight to ten by ten like how does it change things and with cheating it's almost like expanding the engineering challenge or chess out into the the real world to me okay so just allow me i know cheating is horrible and everything but stockfish ai engine and human working together in interesting ways it forget chess just machine and human working together to expand the capability of the human is really fascinating mhmm and that's like a beautiful thing to me of course the purely for the chess game it ruins the game yeah but i just like thinking of how ai can interact with the human in in ways that doesn't that is frictionless like you know like neuralink brain computer interfaces dream of directly connecting the human brain to ai system the the problem in this case is i don't think the human and the ai are interacting together the ai dominates the human is just the mechanism that makes the moves i actually played if i may i i don't maybe i need your advice on this i thought and i told myself i won't do it and then a friend of mine said and a couple of friends and both of them are previous guests in this podcast so i definitely need to do it which is you know connect so i already have for for the chess arm that i built this computer vision on the chess board is able to to extract from vision the way you do optical character recognition extract the board so i was gonna just build that cheating system to demonstrate it with the reason i thought it was interesting so something we didn't mention is i don't know who started this rumor but the rumor started there it might have been like anal beads that yeah i don't know who started this but i do know that elon magnified it my username was dead center in that thing that he retweeted which was hilarious to me you're using oh what do you mean like for tweet he he retweeted the clip but also the copypasta like the the paragraph yeah that was like describing the whole anal beads theory and dead center in the middle of that paragraph is as gotham chess says and nice the worst part about it was i was literally tagged so it was as user slash gotham chess says so every time that paragraph gets posted on reddit i get tagged oh that's alright she's getting posted a lot so yes but yes he tweeted and then there's also the funny thing which i really love the the weirdest most entertaining thing was that part of the same thing where the like plot twist magnus has been using anal beads this whole time that's how you got yes yes i love that so much okay but anyway there's a i i quickly realized that there is i i have to admit that i know not much about sex toys and then i quickly realized that there's a lot of sex toys that have bluetooth capability that you could interact with so you could it's very easy to connect stockfish to sex toys actually wow actually yes so apparently that's a popular thing like a lot of sex toys are bluetooth enabled so you can communicate with them so this is actually pretty trivial to do not trivial but but then and then in fact there is a there's several libraries one of them is really active called now this is on github friends it's in rust but i think there's python wrappers it's called butt plug it's the name of the library uh-huh that communicates with it it supports a bunch of different devices a bunch of different like vibrators and all that kind of stuff but then i i looked at the kind of vibrators it supports and they're all like creepy looking i mean like it doesn't it it doesn't have i don't know it felt too dirty you know like there's a line i was like i know is this not gonna because the reason i i like that kind of stuff is i like the joke of it that ultimately is somehow educational because to me i really care about ai and this is a cool little project to do it's super easy to share yeah but i was thinking about doing it i was thinking about doing it at first i said no it's just kinda feels dirty but then the the aforementioned friend said no you should definitely do it i like the who's your who's your test subject no we wouldn't test it you you should i'm well i'm sure that people would sign up right i just went on the table like show the vibration like like this is it's you you're basically converting now it's not i'm not obviously a grand master so you you have to say everything i feel like no you don't you could say the square you don't have to say the piece the human will fill in the gap no a good human chess player i can't oh that's what that's the point i wanted to make is like for me i would like to know the actual move i need to make yeah so i i need the full information right so i have to convert the bishop c five whatever mhmm to more to morse code which is a lot of vibration i yes exactly but it still works it's it's hilarious and fun so i was thinking about doing it but because it's pretty easy to do it would be just like a fun exercise i love a mix of technical rigor and humor well this is the perfect project for that right exactly yeah this was born i think out of a user comment in a twitch stream so i thought it was born on reddit this theory but i think eric hansen was streaming chasbra and someone in his chat made that joke and he read it out loud that was the first time it was read out loud and then somebody clipped it and it became international news like i don't have you followed how big the traction got on this anal beads thing no it was covered by every major news network late night talk show trevor noah stephen colbert no international news international news in countries like china where i would have never thought that they would report about anal beads mhmm yeah did they what was the tonality of it was it seen as a joke or did they say there's a cheating scandal i think two of us mention anal beads i literally anal beads like just say anal just re accused accused denies denies cheating with anal beads which he never did he never denied cheating with anal beads it was a joke internet theory if i was him i would lean into it yeah i can't imagine man like that's i i don't i don't know what the right thing for him to do is but it's you're not touching this one the anal oh i i i've talked about it i don't say the words anal beads in my youtube videos but i'll say beads though yeah yeah i'll i'll i got you the thing is you think i should do the the code thing is it a good tutorial sure yeah i think it would be hilarious if you find a way to do it yeah yeah you can show that it is possible to theoretically vibrate via bluetooth chess moves mhmm and if someone shoves it up their ass what it was another joke okay they offered you to play naked they're gonna make you spread your cheeks yeah it was i i didn't understand why naked solved the problem i think there's it it doesn't have to be naked i don't think naked is enough yeah okay some questions from reddit ask him ask levy if he deep dominates his audience i saw that yeah i saw i saw that was the top one i have a i have a love hate relationship with the chess subreddit yeah so that's why some of those questions were gonna be tough i have a love hate relationship that's a tough question or is that come from a place of love very very tough to say very tough to say is love and hate like they're basically next door neighbors on reddit i feel like correct they oscillate very quickly between each other yes so reddit chess specifically i think is mostly folks who are around before the chess boom so the chess the chess subreddit sorry i didn't hear that yeah so a lot of them have been around for five years seven years ten years even more and i think the average age on reddit is lower than the average age on this chess subreddit i think that the chess subreddit is beyond the age of twenty maybe even twenty five like a lot of folks there are ancient ancient people an amazing twenties yeah no i mean not fifteen or sixteen anarchy chess is younger so anarchy chess is basically chess memes that's the subreddit yes you got it yeah anarchy chess is great a lot of stupid memes on there did they like you or or no or is it lovely until my crypto sponsorship which is a separate convo that i'm more than happy to have but yeah so my relationship with the reddit chess subreddit is tough because my content on youtube stops at a certain point with them they can't learn from me because i'm tailoring to ninety five percent of my audience which is about sixteen seventeen hundred and below and i have a lot of content where i jokingly make fun of low rated players and everyone's in on it and we all have fun and i laugh at myself a ton laugh at as you can even see in this conversation i but just like you mentioned in with with clips and out of context things folks have already formed the perception of my personality there's nothing i can do to win them back and i think the dominant percentage of the loudest group of folks on the chess subreddit they just they have a certain perception of me it's not going to change and you add something like cryptocurrency sponsorship which people on reddit just in general are relatively negative on the subject is gonna start you know snowballing more and more so if you ever look up a thread of should i buy a gotham course and it's on reddit chest it's gonna say no everyone's calling it a scam overpriced interesting i got i i i heard a lot of really positive stuff i don't know where on reddit in general about you me yeah you might have you might have been looking for it you might have not been looking for for negative things and i do i was looking for like best educators online like that kind of stuff i don't i i'll be it might have not been read at chess i'll be totally honest with you if if you ever go there and look for something like best recaps or best educational content for intermediates i'm not mentioned i might not be mentioned because i'm already expected to be on the list so they just kind of wanna generally shout out smaller creators totally fine with that and i'm not even going on this whole explanation because i want to win folks back it's just sort of the reality of the situation a lot of my stuff is really click baity and i'm playing the youtube game yeah they don't want that do you ever feel like a limit or tension between your creativity and the youtube algorithm like do you feel like it has negative yeah effects on it yeah yeah i wanna cover more in-depth stuff in a thirty minute video that i think is super useful to people it's only gonna get sixty thousand views and you feel why is that a bad thing is it is it good is it good to mix it up yes it's good to mix it up but i make a video a day i make one bad video the other videos suffer and then if i make two videos that underperform the rest of the videos don't get pushed out as much your earnings can go down forty percent day to day which doesn't happen in other careers and if i ever wanna supplement if i ever wanna make a very instructional video i try to do it in a very fun way so something like eight of magnus carlsen's best end games you can still learn a ton but the concept of the video is going to be different like i tried to still teach things but in more interesting and exciting ways like the the guy who was scammed for a million dollars aleksei shiroff who was basically promised the world championship if he won his match he won his match he didn't get a world championship so there's still stuff in there you can learn and you can my my goal is just you click on the video you learn something and you enjoy yourself that's it get people to click on it by any means necessary but once they're there have quality stuff they can learn and yeah i see yeah man i wish so i i have zero of those pressures but i also really really like i turn off views and all that kind of stuff i don't pay attention to any of that but i wish youtube would like the algorithm would include how good the video is like beneficial for people's long term well-being in in the calculation yeah i'm i actually really hate the fact that they turned off dislikes yeah i didn't get that at all because like now i don't know the difference between like for tutorials specifically like i don't know what's a good chess video or not or what's a good review or or not but yeah i mean it emphasizes following certain people more than like if you trust the creator but like man i really don't know what's a good video or not essentially and then you have to trust more the title and then the clickbaityness comes in and it's it's no good you have to use your own gut instinct as opposed to data sucks yeah there's videos that have almost no views that are still great incredible yeah and some of some of the best ones some people who are just focused on like the the quality yeah and don't wanna play the game or don't even know how to play and they don't really wanna play the game of the youtube algorithm yeah it sucks it sucks especially given how dominant youtube is in in defining the sort of the creative energy of our whole civilization yeah of the youth not just chess not just chess when are you going to chess box against eric rosen this is a question from reddit chess box you you said your your hands are all messed up yeah yeah are you training for something or regular like so i also just remembered we never talked about hikaru so i can talk about rosen and hikaru in the same chess boxing oh shit that makes sense is this your macgregor like shit talk segment no no no no eric rosen is actually a close friend of mine i probably have five of those and he just so happens to be not just a chess streamer but we we we talked about buying homes we've talked about he stayed at my place he took my wedding photos i flew him to new york and paid for all his stuff just so he could hang out with my wife and i and you know take some six am photos in the sun in in the park so oh he looks familiar yeah so he's yeah he's a good friend of mine now in terms of chess boxing chess boxing is this really fascinating sport where you have boxing but you also have chess and you have rounds so you start a chess game with a clock that segment itself lasts for a couple of minutes they put the board away and pause the clock whatever the time situation is then you box for a minute and that keeps going on i don't know how it works in terms of the time expiring meaning in fighting there's judges that just tell you how the fight was going right here i don't know who wins and how like do you win by you can win by knockout you can win by checkmate or their clock can run out on the chessboard but is there judges who who was there a round limit does this just go on and on and on and on you know what i mean yeah i thought it's like twelve rounds right isn't this a thing in in in russia it's a big thing in the uk uk yeah uk i don't i don't know why and there's a lot of youtuber events just for boxing so youtubers just learn to box and then they just box no chess they just straight up box each other like jake paul for example you ever gonna get jake paul in here yeah yeah i'm sure okay i'm sure i feel like we've so many different guests have been mentioned jake jake paul would be would be a fun guess but he's obviously the biggest scarer he's legitimately boxing people he's not yeah but chess players is never gonna learn to box to that level and all of us are starting basically from zero mhmm and ludwig talked to me behind the scenes say hey how would you feel about being in a chess boxing match i said okay yeah maybe when is it gonna be he said five months from now i've always wanted to train combat i've mhmm weight lifted i've done cardio i've played basketball you're a ufc fan too yeah but do you admire fighting yeah i would enjoy it i just have a really bad lower back and that makes a lot of different combat difficult but i said you know what screw this i'm going to contact a few local gyms yeah and one of them the guy emailing me back and forth had actually watched my youtube videos so so he was the first to respond and he said yeah like come in do a couple classes like see how you feel so first i did conditioning which killed me because fighting conditioning as you know it kills you it's it's a completely different type of conditioning but i felt good and i really wanted to come back and since july i've been training three four days a week nice you feel pretty good i love it lower back feels good lower everything feels the whole body gets stronger so so you what you're saying is you're gonna fuck up with cara it's easy training i'm not i'm not fighting so i talked to eric about it yeah and the truth is we're both concerned about head trauma i haven't actually sparred i like sparring shadow boxing but i go there i do personal training i don't do a group class i'm not fighting i'm fighting the bag i'm doing shadow boxing my form is improving but i haven't been punched i get hit in the stomach you know i get hit in the side with kicks nobody's punched me in the face yet so i think we both were adequately concerned about that and there was not some ridiculous amount of money on the table so we decided it's just not worth pursuing mhmm how does saqqara come into the picture because well he he's a possible competitor people ask me all the time would you who would you who would you fight fight would you yeah people are like andrea botez would kick your ass yeah that's a tough one because i can't what am i gonna say i'm gonna fight a woman who i'm larger than and you know so i just have to take the elegance anytime a woman is mentioned that's fine i'm like oh and six winning that one right exactly so i'm oh i'm i've lost to both both houses anna rudolf anna kremling they're all chess creators and like like hypothetically yeah i get it hypothetical fight yeah yeah okay there you go been training i think andrea has been training that's because an event got announced this this event that i was hypothetically gonna be the main event against eric rosen yeah it was a announced yeah and then you kinda like thought like maybe let's not do this no i i knew once i declined to fight eric that i would not be participating and i i even knew you know i knew who was gonna be the main event because i was kind of offered both of those guys so amman hamilton so is this still going on the chess boxing event will happen in december in los angeles yeah nice so who is the main event it's amon hamilton who's also chezsbrough so they have a couple of guys as part of the chezsbrough channel and lawrence trent lawrence trent is a international master from england he's a i think he's done some boxing a little bit he's a commentator brash guy nice controversial guy yeah it's funny because they started lawrence put out some videos and i went damn i should've done this yeah i think it but i i mean you're right first of all there's so many things to say one of which is if you're if you wanna take it seriously you know it does pull you in like you know if you train a lot it's gonna affect the rest of your life and then and then there's it it changes you i think taking combat sports seriously changes you in good and there's negative cost to it i think because it's a whole another thing man it's like a yep it's like doing marathon running or something it really pulls you in and the other thing is the is the head trauma like you you have to take that kind of stuff seriously especially if you're doing sparring and all that kind of stuff yeah still some of the celebrities i don't know why but it's pretty exciting right i don't know why it'd be fun to watch hikaru like there's something i always said if hikara and magnus did a a boxing event and yeah i was the co main event against i don't know who that would that'd be that'd be has magnus said anything about it like about bardoon chess box well first of all he's gonna commentate the ludwig event nice which he which he said and he he kinda said oh there's been people in the past that are my level in chess not mine his level in chess and have wanted to get physical with him i think he's talking about hikaru it's it's i don't think anybody else's that'd be that'd be a good one man that'd be a good one i think magnus what do you think where's that one i think magnus is in better physical shape he's also a little bit bigger i think than hikaru mhmm longer reach i think hikaru's a dog though i think i think he'll i don't think he's gonna he's gonna get out of that like i i i don't think he's gonna quit out in in the ring i i would think hikaru just goes nuts in the beginning and burns himself out so if if magnus can survive that i feel like hikaru would just go crazy and and then just get exhausted would not be able to pace himself correctly maybe chasing that first round knockout yeah yeah just swing like crazy honestly i just love to see that which is like the effect of physical exertion on the on the game i think it's sure they're strong enough to yes but i think we definitely underestimate the effect of being punched maybe bleeding out of your nose or something like that it's it's it's no joke i can't i can't say i'm anticipating the first day i actually do some sparring and get seriously hit because i know it's not gonna feel good even now i take a hard jab to the to the stomach or the ribs and i'm just like man this is this is rough i mean i i had to do three minutes on heavy bag and when i finished my i had i had been like slacking on my form because my arms were tired and i hit with my fingers instead of my knuckles and my hands are like you can see the the red skin like completely pink meaty skin under i didn't realize when i was hitting and only today it's the pain is unbearable so i can't imagine head this must be no i mean it gets a it's a different thing i mean of course your skin gets tougher everything gets tougher so it gets used to it the head the head is a weird one because it's not gonna send you those kinds of signals you're not gonna get the the skin type of signals the brain is a weird thing because it doesn't hurt yeah it just does the damage and the damage can materialize itself manifest itself only years later yeah it's a weird one but then we all die there's there's that braveheart speech i gotta ask you about bots because to me it's like super interesting and you've played a lot of bots at different levels you have a video called the advanced chess bots are terrifying yeah so what's the difference between playing humans and bots like you mentioned this nelson bot yeah that brings his queen out i think it's rated sixteen hundred or fourteen hundred oh okay twelve forty i think so so like there's a style to those what what's the difference between the way bots play and the way humans play a lot of people prefer playing bots because they have anxiety playing other humans it's a very legitimate thing interesting a lot of beginners they they don't like live chess they get nervous elo anxiety you get close to your highest ever rating you panic happens to me too yeah happens to me even now so they play bots they're somehow more reliable or something yeah they're i don't know but that's it's a big thing it's a big thing and the popularity of that video shows that people enjoy watching you play chess bots so i'm gonna demystify this this might be shocking those bots are all the same bot for the most part mhmm you could just program a bot to make mistakes at a certain moment mhmm you could program a bot to spend less time on certain moves and it's gotten sophisticated enough that you can basically program it to play at whatever more or less level that a human plays at and so i'll play at a eighteen hundred level so it's programmed to throw in mistakes the problem is and this is why it's all beginners to not play bots because bots are programmed in the following way beginner bots are like literal toddlers they have no understanding whatsoever they will literally lose all their pieces but they won't lose all their pieces and make mistakes the way beginners do beginners actually know how to start a game they just struggle the first eight moves nine moves mhmm their mistakes are very different than bob bob plays completely outlandish types of mistakes that you cannot pick up in terms of a pattern standpoint because no actual humans play like that they just move their queen to the opposite side of the board if for no reason you can take it yeah it's not even a blunder it's almost like randomness yes completely random and this problem extends further because advanced bots will play an opening completely reasonably and they just hang a rook which okay maybe happens but that's not exactly how you get to eighteen hundred at eighteen hundred that's a very strong level of the game you know your openings very well you start navigating the middle game based on already things that you remember mhmm and then basically one side chooses a bad plan and the other side chooses a better plan and one thing leads to another nobody just recreationally hangs all their pieces which is the way bots are kind of programmed to play but some of those bots in that video were i remember playing them and they were they yeah they were nuts they were out calculating me every time i thought i had a trick in two three second moment of thought it would just play the best move and sometimes that also happens it gets into a dead loop where it just starts bulldozing you and it can't stop so it made its mistakes already yeah it's programmed to make only a few and then it just bulldozes you the rest of the way interesting i mean that's that's why i i played with stockfish a bunch so i i got i built a for myself a bunch of different chess experiments recently i had to do with the chess playing bot but i also built a infinite chess board where it was stockfish was playing like an infinite number of chess games and one of the parameters that was interesting to play with is how long it gets to think about a move and how that affects the rating of the thing oh i've i've i did that a little bit so is that that's a tricky one i'm sure people know how to do that well but it's trick it's not trivial to to understand like what there must be a good formula for it but it's also interesting to think about like a controlled number of blunders mhmm but it's probably better the controlled number of blunders is not a good way to build a bot yeah it's yeah for training purposes at least the time the time per move is probably better but the craziest thing is i did that a couple of my of my devs were helping me with the build like a i'm i'm scaling my courses into a better chess learning platform essentially we've done a lot of different experiments with stockfish which i'm even happy to get into here and stockfish making moves in point one millisecond plays better than a human which is disgusting and disturbing frankly because that's crazy like you can't react to a a car stopping in front of you anywhere near that fast and yeah so the reason i was interested in that is because when you have an a very large chessboard you have tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of game going on at the same time you have to the like think of the minimum amount of thinking per move that you can allow for and it does it does seem it's damn good at least to my eye basically at the lowest possible setting you can give it so yeah it's incredible it's incredible what bots are able to do and now it's as far as i know is primarily machine learning based stockfish so stockfish moved to machine learning completely it's not doing search as far as i know yeah this is where you you lose me a bit but the move discovery and evaluation is what's been changing in in the way stockfish works so it's discovering of moves and then the way it looks forward and then evaluates positions that has changed but matthew sadler who wrote the book game changer about alpha zero alpha zero yeah yeah that that he explains it significantly better but that that's the way i think it it works what did that make you feel when you first saw alphazero play i was excited i i didn't have any any sort of existential thoughts i enjoyed watching it completely destroy openings that people thought were good and it it it that experiment though has does have some caveat in the sense that i think alphazero was playing with a full tank of servers and i think stockfish wasn't which i think is what one of the things people point out they they weren't playing since then they were able to demonstrate much less yeah but but also alpha zero stopped developing they stopped developing it yes which which sucks but again from their perspective from deepmind's perspective it's like alright well we took on this really tricky game did something honestly incredible they won they won i mean it did well not just won i mean they did it without any human supervision so like without any training on human expert games mhmm so only through self play which i mean that's what learning is about it's like so what you think of as a child a human child a toddler learning from you know somewhat nothing and becoming a capable human that's that's what we think of when we think about intelligence so the fact that it's able to play itself and become the best player in the world at at the game of go and all kinds of games is just incredible and obviously that inspired the modern stock fish yep now to do the same all the same kind of self play methods somebody on reddit asked a pretty interesting question mhmm i don't know if you have an interesting answer to it what makes a chess move quote unquote human as you are someone oh this is to me but it's mentioning you in third person as you are someone working in ai this idea of humanness would seem incredibly interesting yes sir it is especially since most cheat detection relies on humanness as a way to detect cheaters i think since children being born right now will have the advantage of engine training their whole life they will start to see the game the way an engine does will a person be considered a cheater if they play like an engine there also seem to be a discrepancy especially with levy about who can play what appears to be a nonhuman move he often says things like quote if you were a normal player normal in quotes if you were a normal player i would think you were cheating but since it's magnus i don't doubt magnus is great but if humanis is our benchmark what is the elo rating where your moves can start to look like an engine without critique there's a bunch of questions in there they combine two of my quotes yes into one so one thing that i like to say is sometimes in a chess game moves look or an opening look so ridiculous that if a viewer played it i would make fun of them or slap them that's always the joke if i was your chess coach i'd smack you but when magnus plays it it was whole wow you know it's a very different so they mixed up this quote with another quote which is you know if if i if i'll be explaining something and i'll say oh and here the engine says you should play like this yeah if one of your opponents plays like this report them for cheating so you say they fuse two quotes they said oh human can't play like that but because it's an engine move but because magnus is playing so they they mixed kind of two things but there's interesting levels of humor and insight there on both of those yeah the difference between human move and engine and like what an engine move is is i think two things number one a computer move is outlandish in its in its concept and its and and its idea so the best example that i can give of that is if you gave a hundred grandmasters a position and told them you know what what do you think the best move here is for black not in this position right here we have nothing but an overwhelming amount of them would look at the position evaluate everything they know about the game of chess which is relatively similar but obviously slightly imbalanced based on their skill level and they would come up with a sample size of two or three moves mhmm and in comes the computer with a fucking haymaker and suddenly everybody goes oh everything we know about chess has gone out the window so they all start looking at that move and they know it's the best move so now they start adding the evidence behind the verdict as opposed to getting to the verdict while first looking at at at the evidence so the concept of it and the idea of it is so outlandish based on a certain type of position that you can't fully grasp it you have to continue to beg the engine to tell you what the variation is a move is only good if its extension is good that's the way chess works so if like a move is good it's because the computer has seen that the various branches of things going forward are also good so you bring all that back and no human could have even conceptualized that initial thing but the second thing about computer moves is they they look counterintuitive so that's a if you might be in a position where it it looks like the demands of the position are a b c and then the computer is like nope it's not because i've seen the future way more than you possibly could have and i don't have emotions so like dumb moves and brilliant moves can look similar yes and oftentimes do and this is actually back to the hans thing a lot of people now dissecting these games they're playing and they're they're basically saying like even fabiano coruana one of the best players in the world was on some on his podcast yesterday basically saying k this is beyond my level saying out of my league yeah what's that what's out of your league you played for the world championship can we get what we can read between the lines right it's is it possible that hans is that level of genius is there like different different kinds of genius like where one you could be out of each other's league kind of thing maybe in the case of magnus it's understanding of endgames it's just somehow he understands the that last phase of the game and the complexities and the problems he can pose better than anybody else so you can see magnus do poor looking moves in the end game or like moves that don't fit what seem your gut says is would would be the optimal yes but also so it it's not that you even think they're right you you just might not even consider them yeah because of overreliance on your own information or even the computer that was what what was going on in game six she kept doing things and kept playing and kept finding play and posing those questions that humans and computers could not understand so he beat the engine basically he could he wouldn't have beaten the engine because they would have defended jan lost that game in the nineties move psychologically he thought the game was over so that contributed computer would have defended so by the by the time this podcast comes out which i don't know it would be in a week or something like that i feel like more will happen let's see you're predicting engine how how does this hans drama end what saga like like let's look in in three months by the time we get to the next world championship let's say what what does what are the options what are the possible let's imagine let's not say like what the probabilities are what are the options chess dot com is forced to or agrees to or whatever to come up with a huge amount of evidence of cheating in the past or hans comes out what are the what what can hans do with this so i'm uncomfortable with the general next year you could maybe update me on this but there was a little bit of an attack on him not a lot of an attack that he's a cheater right mhmm without evidence without clear conclusive evidence physical evidence physical evidence so all of those right that's the tricky thing yeah so like that stuff we're talking about is beyond my level that starts being kind of intuitive circumstantial evidence there's the statistical evidence behind the over the board games that he's played in twenty twenty twenty twenty one where the games match what's called engine correlation more than magnus and many other top grandmasters combined but that can be argued is because he was very strong in playing weaker opposition so there's always kind of this argument against statistics right there's the fact that the guy who magnus name dropped maxime loogie loogie is a chess grandmaster and he's even been i think president of the us chess federation i've played him in some blitz games it turns out i wasn't even fully aware of the extent of this he has been banned from chess dot com for cheating for cheating have they actually have has him and hans actually worked yes so that was why he name dropped that right so that's also not good you see where this is getting you still don't have the physical proof but you have smoke so i don't know how this ends i don't know if this if if he denies it to the death and he ends up filing some sort of legal action some sort of ethics complaint yeah or he admits everything i don't know but well no matter what i hope despite chess or not that he's mentally strong enough for whatever is to come that's what i keep saying because i think under fire right yeah i can't i can't imagine right like i i just i really can't imagine and maybe well we just have too much compassion but i don't think so i really just feel like at the end of the day chess is just a game but it is a game played by millions of people throughout history and nations have basically fought wars over the chessboard so like there's there's a lot it's like olympics olympics is just a little oh this dude running and so on the hockey is just the thing with with the puck and but you know it's it's also much more than that it's also it's also nations sort of figuring out their conflict in a way that doesn't involve violence yeah it's a serious thing and it's a thing that inspires millions of people and it's a testing ground for intelligent systems that eventually take over human civilization no yeah i mean the bots bots are really interesting i i i don't know if there's other lessons like you you you played a clone of yourself that was you watched stockfish versus stockfish you have a video people should check out each other you have a lot of awesome videos you have a video titled stockfish versus stockfish that was the experiment i made them play each other so i made them play what did you learn from that experiment i enjoy first of all they will always make a draw so engines don't get to play each other from a beginning position because they will always draw especially if they're the same engine so stackfish fifteen stackfish fifteen i don't think one side will ever beat the other basically but if you program them to play a certain opening position according to chess theory you get to see in interesting ways into how they evaluate one of the things one of the ways that it played against the london opening was absurd like it just it was completely ridiculous black sacrificed two pawns as early as move six which is a borderline completely lost position and then both sides foresaw that the only way white was gonna be able to use those that material advantage was to give it back and stabilize their own position like black just got a crazy attack jesus this is crazy yeah but they drew them and they ended up drawing so i i'm also gonna make them play against each other in either bad openings or like some of the most popular gambits looking looking at something like that and the way i'm gonna do this is basically say which chess gambits are the best and the way i'm gonna do that is theoretically the engine should be able to beat the gambit because the gambit is very rarely blessed by the computer so if the computer cannot beat that gambit that means it's good that means it's not losing if it's a completely lost gambit it will beat it but if it draws despite getting that early disadvantage then that means the gambit is very reliable and you can play it so that's a good way to evaluate opening games yeah exactly what's what's the best what's your favorite opening or what what what openings do you like there was an opening that got me back into chess when i was fifteen i had quit for like three years and i went to my friend's house and he had a book by lars skendorf a danish grandmaster called the carokhan defense which is c six do you want white or do you want black do you wanna show them the opening this is the opening the coral cone defense so you play e four i play c six i i have i have to play black that's it yeah and that's it and we develop from here i put my default what what counts as a opening okay but the development does the development matter yeah so from here the development goes into the variations of the karo khan so this is the karo khan like you can be in a city but then you can be in neighborhoods so that's a that's a very non dramatic okay yeah two pawns in the center that that's so that's called the briar variation so which what's a good thing for me two two squares yeah if you can put two pawns in the center yeah you should and then so that's a good thing yes and then i will go here and now you have to decide what you're gonna do with your center pawn you can push take or defend it and push take or defend right yeah what would you suggest take is the the worst take is just stable so we just trade but pushing is considered the best advancing and taking my space away from me so i think alphazero or stockfish would probably always push push and now there's something called like the main line or the sideline main line is what's the most popular played at all levels which is moving the bishop here i've played this a lot but for beginners this is an intermediate players this is why i love this opening so much on move three black already has a plus score which is crazy like it's not supposed to happen and there's this very tricky second most popular move which is undermining your center trying to get you to take my free pawn but destabilize and leave both of them kinda hanging and is that why the the plus score is because you're susceptible to the destabilization yes because people at ninety nine percent of the rating ladder do not understand how to deal with what's coming basically they don't know how to deal with a structural attack so would would stockfish try to defend the pawn here and keep no it would take the pawn and tell you to go fuck yourself oh i knew that because i am thirty four hundred right they would take the pawn and be like alright win it back and even if you did you would suffer it would make you win it back in the most annoying way it would make you tie your shoes together and block it so so i like as stockfish i would take yes that's the best move that's the best move but not at ninety nine percent of the rating ladder which is funny interesting but you like to play this i i play this against gms i play both i move my bishop i i push the and what are the different ways it evolves like then the rest doesn't matter so this is just like a pawn structure thing yeah and i mean it it again deeper most openings so it's anywhere from like two moves to like ten moves kinda thing yeah you can be out of theory very very quickly to move two move three like basically on your own you have a general idea but you don't remember games i mean i i know caro con games from start to finish because i've played it since twenty eleven so you know all the different branches that goes in that down yeah i i think i know every opening in chess basically i think most most title players know every opening but we don't know we can't play it competitively because we'd be but what are some of the weirder openings that like slightly suboptimal but might be ex explored like magnus might play them just to fuck with the opponent he he played something recently actually against this german prodigy vincent keimer which was a specific move order in a very popular opening so it was basically a position that had been reached thousands of times but the move order magnus chose with white was played maybe point o five percent of the time which is crazy it's thousands of games and it's supposed to be not good meaning it allows black to equalize because that's what black is going for not winning the game but equalizing because you go second magnus says i don't care about equalizing i just want a position i i don't want my opponent to know the answers to the test and that's so interesting yeah you're too because it also fucks you psychologically it yeah throws you off and just always keep you on your toes he's in a weird position but he also has the advantage of being able to intimidate mhmm i wonder how many people how much is that a role of it like being scared of the other person it's a huge role i think i think some of the top guys would deny it but you know when you're in the seventh hour and you're playing magnus yeah it's a very different feeling than some of the other when magnus is messing around in the opening it's very different than another person messing around in the opening you just kinda like expect to for something to be there we'll see if it translates to poker for him but i think he he gets a little bit maybe less respect in the poker world in the chess world he's sort of alpha he gets a lot of respect i just talked to daniel on the ground and he gives gets the only person that doesn't respect magnus carlsen honestly either in chess or poker is magnus carlsson i was gonna say hans neiman that's true but like magnus is hilarious i mean when he talks about his rating he's like oh it's pretty good when he talks about how good he's this poker i suck but you know i think that self critical view that he i think he honestly believes to to a degree is is probably part of the the the engine that fuels them to get better and better and better and better yeah well what i'm saying is if you if you're face to face with a chessboard it's not the same as being in a nine handed poker table with him you kinda keep an eye on him maybe in in a he's a mysterious guy but chess is different because you're like this is the man yeah there's very few people yeah so in in poker they talk about phil ivey that way yeah yeah yeah as like this super intimidating i think that's that's it's probably harder to intimidate in poker actually i don't know i don't know there's something intimidating about like excellence in a deterministic game that's just terrifying like you're i mean it's like playing stockfish like you're fucked mhmm this thing will suffocate you and especially when you do makes moves that you don't understand this i to me the most beautiful thing honestly is the sacrifices that the the engines do just the it's such a fuck you yep like i could sacrifice pieces mhmm and i'll get them back and i'll get them back more and i could look even i don't even have to get them back your position is so bad i gave you full material and there's nothing you can do about it yeah that's terrifying yeah that's terrifying that's like that transfers to ai systems in general like like a system that plays weak just to to fool you mhmm for people who are trying to get better at chess beginners or at any stage of their development what what advice would you give about getting better except watch your yeah of course watch my videos check out chesley dot com that's where we're gonna scale the courses to but no on a serious note you have to be prepared to lose way more than win my mom gave me advice when i was maybe thirteen or fourteen and i just discovered that i i liked girls she said you're gonna get a lot more nos in life than yeses that even happened with with my wife actually our whole journey is is quite quite fascinating it's paved with rejection paved with yes various ghost things over the course of years but then we got married and we love each other very much so it's a it's a it's a wonderful tale but it's the it's the same in chess you're gonna lose a lot and you have to be for adults i noticed kids and adults learn chess very differently kids yell out in class and they're very excited and they don't realize how many times they get something wrong adults never wanna talk during lessons because they're afraid of being wrong adults will preface correct answers with this is probably wrong but like shut up you're paying for a for a private lesson this is the place to be wrong mhmm you know so adults especially think that being dominant in a career where they've dedicated a lot of their brainpower a lot of their work ethic and a lot of their study time it's gonna translate to chess they do it to their own kids they helicopter their own kids because they try to apply a lot of the same stuff chess studying chess is different than studying anything else anything else same could be argued for martial arts i guess but yeah a hundred percent you have to have a beginner's mind and what that actually means is sucking in every aspect of the game and and studying all the interesting ways in which you suck and you will realize you get better without actually trying to get better i show up to the boxing gym one day i move my hips better yeah and my i would do shadow boxing sensei goes you're moving your feet better today you got better i'm like i didn't practice footwork it just your brain just starts putting it all together randomly you might study a shitload and still lose a hundred points if you're gonna study chess oh and for fuck's sake this is the only activity where people go in going how much do i have to work to be a grand master nowhere else in my life have i ever seen someone try to pick up a hobby and wanna be the the the top ranking level only in chess you're right but like for example when i like grappling sports i'll see people come to a gym and basically ask like how long before i can get into the ufc right but ufc champion is different i mean no grandmaster is equivalent to getting into the ufc i guess yeah so but people quickly realize when like the hundred and ten pound girl taps them out over and over and they're a two thirty pound like ripped dude they realize like okay this is an art this is a journey yeah and i think if you resist the lessons that failure teaches you that's when you don't grow so like just relax mhmm and one of the things you have to learn probably applies to chest too is to know how to relax your body your mind and just like there's something about just like you said like if you don't resist it if you relax then your body your mind will learn the way of this game mhmm and and probably add to that is just put a lot of hours in of having fun but then then i on that perpetual chess podcast i listened to somebody that say like it doesn't like puzzles none of that what matters is the number of hours you spend kind of suffering meaning like thinking deeply like count like like yeah straining like thinking with your mind like really working hard so and then the you know you have the magnus who says no what matters is the number of hours you spend having fun yeah it's a mix it's a mix he's right i don't quite agree with suffering but i think people do a lot of fake learning they play speed games they just go through tactics so okay i have to do twenty tactics okay boop wrong next one i used to tell my students you need to do ten puzzles and you need to get one hundred percent correct i don't care how long it takes so i suppose that kind of is like the suffering theory but if you do thirty puzzles and you get eight correct what even is that that's so laughable in the correct amount of you know was it twenty nine percent i don't know but twenty six percent it's you can't do that you have to get things right and that's the only way you're actually and that requires like thinking deeply and like really struggling like especially if you're doing the puzzles at the level that that's your level i've done a puzzle for an hour before because i was so stubborn yeah i didn't wanna just put in a wrong answer yeah the the the the guy i was listening to said like that's good you should you should do that maybe for me and the same with blindfold chess i have to say like my my blindfold skills i never practice i just i can visualize the board quite well i've played at most i've played four games blindfolded at the same time that sucks that just feels horrible in the brain afterward but like i can play four simultaneous games blindfolded yeah and what's that take to do that i don't know and i get asked that all the time how do i practice why the fuck why would you do that to yourself that's not me it's a party trick it is yes i it is the video of magnus doing it in columbus circle on youtube has like i don't know how many views i did it live with an announcer i can't imagine how chaotic that was but he yeah it's a great party trick yeah oh there is a reddit thing i i forgot to ask magnus but they asked me to ask him because they moved the wrong piece yes and then somehow he remembered i don't know how that happened i have to tell you i i was i kinda presume that he figured out from the way the other person was moving that they moved the wrong piece yeah yeah i forgot to ask him that yep why did i forget i mean my memory sucks you said you know ups and downs in your childhood a little rough sometimes also you get attacked by the beautiful wonderful people on the internet sure so sometimes it's difficult what's what's been the lowest point that you ever gone to in your mind in my career or in my life in your life in your career and everything your mind so have you ever been depressed for sure yes how how did you like if you can remember moments how did you overcome that well i i will share two anecdotes one when i was may twenty twelve so i was sixteen and a half and i was living in a household situation where i thought nobody knew what was going on basically without sharing obviously extremely personal details like what was going on except me and i confided in my grandmother i was imagine living in a house where you basically feel like a prisoner you don't wanna interact with anybody in the house you don't know how you're supposed to bring these things up of course this sounds extremely vague and i just don't i don't feel like exposing all of my entire family drama to the audience but i lived this way for probably something like eight months i don't i don't know something ridiculous it was the junior year of high school so i was supposed to take my sats that was the year i was supposed to finish up my portfolio for college because you only get really a few months of senior year to start applying it was a fuck it was a nightmare complete nightmare and i i don't know how i got through it time went by i listened to sad music and tried to spend as little time as home as possible i would pretend to fall asleep at my friends' houses so that my mom was like are you coming for dinner and i would just pretend to be asleep so it was just a grind yeah yeah it was it was a grind i i don't remember a whole lot from from that period just sort of finding what made me happy and trying to focus on it and i was a teenager in the house i wasn't gonna run away i still had a roof over my head so i'm not not saying i had it better or worse than others i just had it different and actually recently this is much more on my memory i more or less tore up a very happy life my wife and i had and i've talked about this in bursts on stream but essentially what happened was we we had just been living in it's actually funny the the way we got into this apartment was was also very bad but we were living in just a very like nice little apartment like high rise apartment safe and the reason we moved into a high rise was because we had lived in a house for two weeks that got broken into not because of who i am but because we suspect we had people moving in mattresses and they went oh shit these two people live here that's it mhmm and basically there was three apartments my upstairs neighbor let in somebody that they didn't expect and the guy cracked our door open with a crowbar thank god that was the first day in two years my wife went to work did they know did they not know i don't know everything happens for a reason nobody got hurt mhmm nobody got hurt nobody got hurt yeah they stole they stole an some couple of important things but nobody was hurt and the cubs did nothing so you you moved into a high rise so you moved into a high rise in new york yeah in new york for for safety and we're away from things and we have our own nice little nook and somewhere some months into it i started hearing noises from above our neighbors and it started in the morning seven am it started in the afternoon and i picked up on it and i expected it every day for weeks then it was driving me crazy and i was like okay we're gonna go have a civil conversation with whoever up there sounds like kids mhmm then we go knock lady gaslit the shit out of us i've never been gaslit that hard in my life she went noise what noise it's probably our other neighbor who's a boxer lady you have kids we can hear you through the vents hear you talking do your kids do went to the front desk of the building they did nothing went to the leasing office they did nothing and basically over time time i just thought this was driving me nuts it was and back to the stubbornness thing i i i decided we were leaving we were going to live somewhere there was no noise because we can't beat these people there's there's nothing we can do right and my wife i dragged her around to a bunch of different viewings i was dead set i was i was decided i was completely miserable and i we found a house to rent like a nice house family had just moved away house stand alone house not gonna have neighbors but wife decided that not wife decided we decided that the it's too big it's too big for for so we're gonna get a dog we always wanted an animal so we're gonna get a dog so we get an absolute lunatic puppy who just doesn't let us sleep at all this is on top of everything else of the mental health crisis that's going on and the day we are moving to this house i realize i fuck up like i realized that this whole thing was in my head and i don't wanna leave mhmm i don't wanna leave this could have all been avoided and the guilt and i didn't wanna exist like it's not that i it wasn't suicide but it you know the feeling of just you want to just observe yourself from a distance yeah and i couldn't sleep i thought my wife was gonna leave me like this is the way and that's what anxiety does it also takes everything you feel to an absolute dread and that i experienced for a good chunk of two weeks and then we kinda settled down and decided like we're gonna live did you tell her about it like were you able to talk through it yeah yeah i yeah does does she know the levels of madness that could be inside your mind i don't know if she'll ever know but i tried to tell her that yes and give glimpses yes i'm not i'm not sure you'll ever know i that's the point yeah i try to that's why i try to keep busy but that was that was the darkest i've got and yet through all of that i went on stream every day i made youtube videos every day like i understood that i had a job to do and and i did it and i talked about it here and there but that was that that was the worst that i ever got because i'm learning that the emotions i experience are guilt remorse and your brain just goes in circles basically about things that you've done or haven't done it's funny because noise can do that also so the noise the noise was real but it was building in your head yeah so i i tried to i actually it it's kinda funny because i i like to focus deeply you know i'll have like sources of noise i've i've tried to teach myself over time i'll go to like coffee shops and stuff to like i i like i almost try to put myself next to annoying situations so i get like trained real and maybe i should do that but it's at a certain point at the same time i've gotten to hang out with certain people especially in la they're like in the middle of nowhere yeah like a malibu or something and it's like that quiet can you hear your ears ringing it's so quiet basically and it's like holy shit this is a good play this is a good way if you wanna write something or create something this is like super quiet so my mom is my mom's a science journalist science author she just published her first her first book actually on poop of all things yeah fee fecal the the waste management it is actually very fascinating concept and look through history and she would do that she goes to complete solitude yeah and she writes yeah it's beautiful no sirens i mean new york is the opposite of that so you know it's you you've you've brought it mhmm you brought it on yourself i i've lived there for twenty years it has has it been tough like going on stream to put on the face of happiness through that yeah yes but i find my ways to have moments where i can talk about it if it's on a stream i don't get ten thousand live viewers so it's very different it's if i stream late night i get fifteen hundred two thousand viewers i used to care a lot more about viewers on on on stream but i've basically invested fully in youtube so that's kind of the way i've and i i think i don't know maybe you can correct me me but i think people appreciate the the human being behind the chess streamer i think so i think so i think a lot of people not in the chess world but just a lot of people they they put on a persona and just in general social media is the highlights of your life or the lowlights just as long as they're dramatic but i i've tried i try to be very open and honest when i'm tired i'm tired it's what makes my recaps of my tournaments i think so real yeah man you're an incredible person i've been a fan for a long time it's it's kinda funny that we connected and we got a chance to talk please please keep creating keep teaching people for now i'm not going anywhere well it could end at any moment as we talked about so yeah thank you so much for talking today man thank you for everything you do it was an honor it was great thanks for having me on thanks for listening to this conversation with levi rosman to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from irving chernihv every chess master was once a beginner thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
