the following is a conversation with john mearsheimer a professor at university of chicago and one of the most influential and controversial thinkers in the world he teaches speaks and writes about the nature of power and war on the global stage in history and today please allow me to say once again my hope for this little journey i'm on i will speak to everyone on all sides with compassion with empathy and with backbone i will speak with vladimir putin and with volodymyr zelensky with russians and with ukrainians with israelis and with palestinians with everyone my goal is to do whatever small part i can to decrease the amount of suffering in the world by trying to reveal our common humanity i believe that in the end truth and love wins i will get attacked for being naive for being a shell for being weak i'm none of those things but i do make mistakes and i will get better i love you all and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the

slash lex this is a lex fridman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's john mearsheimer can you explain your view on power in international politics as outlined in your book the tragedy of great power politics and in your writing since then yeah i make two sets of points there first of all i believe that power is the currency of international relations and by that i mean that states are deeply interested in the balance of power and they're interested in maximizing how much power they control and the question is why states care so much about power in the international system there's no higher authority so if you get into trouble and you dial nine one one there's nobody at the other end in a system like that you have no choice but to figure out for yourself how best to protect yourself and the best way to protect yourself is to be powerful to have as much power as you can possibly gain over all the other states in the system therefore states care about power because it enhances or maximizes their prospects for survival second point i would make is that in the realist story or in my story power is largely a function of material factors the two key building blocks of power are population size and wealth you wanna have a lot of people and you wanna be really wealthy of course this is why the united states is so powerful it has lots of people and it has lots of wealth china was not considered a great power until recently because it didn't have a lot of wealth certainly had population size but it didn't have wealth and without both a large population and much wealth you're usually not considered a great power so i think power matters but when we talk about power it's important to understand that it's population size and wealth that are underpinning it so there's a lot of interesting things there first you said nations in relation to each other are is essentially in a state of anarchism yeah well anarchy basically means the opposite of hierarchy sometimes people think when you're talking about anarchy you're talking about murder and mayhem but that's not what anarchy means in the realist context anarchy simply means that you don't have hierarchy there's no higher authority that sits above states states are like pool balls on a table right and in an anarchic world there's no higher authority that you can turn to if you get into trouble and of course the political philosopher who laid this all out was thomas hobbes and hobbes talked about life in the state of nature and in the state of nature you have individuals and those individuals compete with each other for power and the reason that they do is because in the state of nature by definition you have no higher authority and hobbes' view is that the way to get out of this terrible situation where individuals are competing with each other and even killing each other is to create a state it's what he calls the leviathan and that of course is the title of his famous book so the idea is to escape anarchy you create a state and that means you go from anarchy to hierarchy mhmm the problem in international politics is that there is no world state there is no hierarchy and if you have no hierarchy and you're in an anarchic system you have no choice but to try to maximize your relative power to make sure you are as we used to say when i was a kid on new york city playgrounds the biggest and baddest dude on the block not because you necessarily wanna beat up on other kids or on other states but because again that's the best way to survive and as i like to point out to people the best example of what happens when you're weak in international politics is what the chinese call the century of national humiliation mhmm from the late eighteen forties to the late nineteen forties the chinese were remarkably weak and the great powers in the system preyed upon them and that sends a very important message to not only the chinese but to other states in the system don't be weak be as powerful as you can and we'll talk about it but humiliation can lead to resentment or resentment leads to something you've also studied which is nazi germany in the nineteen thirties we'll talk about it but staying to the psychology and philosophy picture what's the connection between the will to power in the individual as you mentioned and the will to power in a nation the will to power in an individual has a lot to do with individual psychology the story that i tell about the pursuit of power is a structural argument it it's an argument that says when you are in a particular structure when you're in a system that has a specific architecture which is anarchy the states have no choice but to compete for power mhmm so structure is really driving the story here will to power has a lot more to do with an individual in in the nietzschean story where that concept comes from so it's very important to understand that i'm not arguing that states are inherently aggressive right my point is that as long as states are in anarchy right they have no choice but to behave in an aggressive fashion but if you went to a hierarchic system there's no reason for those states to worry about the balance of power because if they get into trouble there is a higher authority that they can turn to there is in effect the leviathan so what is the role of military might in this will to power on the national level well military might is what ultimately matters as i said to you before the two building blocks of power are population size and wealth you didn't mention military money i did not no that's right and it's good that you caught that because if you have a large population mhmm and you're a wealthy country what you do is you build a large military and it's ultimately the size of your military that matters because militaries fight wars and if states are concerned about survival which i argue is the principal goal of every state in the international system for what i think are obvious reasons then they're gonna care about having a powerful military that can protect them if another state comes after them well it's not obvious that a large nation with a lot of people and a lot of money should necessarily build a gigantic army and seek to attain superpower like dominant soul superpower status to military might but you're saying as you see the world today it has to be that way yeah i'm arguing it is obvious if you're a state in the international system do you wanna be weak if you live next door to nazi germany or imperial germany or napoleonic france or even the united states the united states is a ruthless great power you surely recognize that and if you're dealing with the united states of america and you're vladimir putin you wanna make sure you're as powerful as possible so that the united states doesn't put its gun sights on you and come after you same thing is true with china you wanna be powerful in the international system states understand that and they go to great lengths to become powerful just take the united states of america when it started in seventeen eighty three it was comprised of thirteen measly colonies strung out along the atlantic seaboard mhmm over time you know the various leaders of the united states went to great lengths to turn that country into the dominant power in the western hemisphere and then once that was achieved in nineteen hundred we've gone to great lengths to make sure that there's no peer competitor in the system we just wanna make sure that we're number one and my argument is that this is not peculiar to the united states if i'm china for example today i would want to dominate asia the way the united states dominates the western hemisphere they'd be fools not to if i were imperial germany i'd wanna dominate all of europe the way the united states dominates the western hemisphere why because if you dominate all of europe assuming you're imperial germany or napoleonic france then no other state in the area or in the region can threaten you because you're simply so powerful and again what i'm saying here is that the structure of the international system really matters it's the fact that you're in this anarchic system where survival is your principal goal and where i can't know your intentions right you're another state i can't know that at some point you might not come after me you might and if you're really powerful and i'm not i'm in deep trouble yeah so some of the ideas underlying what you've said offensive realism which i would i would love to talk to you about sort of the history of realism versus liberalism but some of the ideas you already mentioned anarchy between states everybody's trying to develop a military capabilities uncertainty such an interesting concept states cannot be sure that other states will not use military capabilities against them which is what of enormous importance to the story and so interesting because you also say that this makes realist more cautious and more peaceful the uncertainty because of of all the uncertainty involved here it's better to approach international politics with caution which is really interesting to think about and again survival most states are interested in in survival and the other interesting thing is you assume all the states are rational which most of the time most of the time you call this framework offensive realism can can you just give a overview of the history of the realism versus liberalism debate as worldviews well i think for many centuries now the big divide within the world of international relations theory is between realism and liberalism these are time honored bodies of theory and before i tell you what i think the differences are between those two bodies of theory it is important to emphasize that there are differences among realists mhmm and differences among liberals and so when you talk about me as an offensive realist you should understand that there are also defensive realists out there and there are a panoply of liberal theories as well but basically realists believe that power matters that states compete for power and that war is an instrument of statecraft and liberals on the other hand have what i would say is a more idealistic view of the world this is not to say that they're naive or foolish but they believe there are aspects of international politics that lead to a less competitive and more peaceful world than most realists see and i'll lay out for you very quickly what are the three major liberal theories today that i think will give you a sense of the more optimistic perspective that is inherent in the liberal enterprise the first and most important of the liberal theories is democratic peace theory and this is a theory that says democracies do not fight against other democracies so the more the world is populated with democracies the less likely it is that we will have wars and this basic argument is inherent in francis fukuyama's the end of history he argues that democracy triumphed first over fascism in the twentieth century it then triumphed over communism and that means that in the future we're gonna have more and more liberal democracies on the planet and if you have more and more liberal democracies and those democracies don't fight each other then you have a more peaceful world that was his argument it's a very liberal argument a realist like me would say that it doesn't matter whether a state is a democracy or not all states behave the same way because the structure of the system getting back to our earlier discussion about international anarchy the structure of the system leaves those states no choice whether they're democracies or autocracies and again the liberal view this first liberal theory is that democracies don't fight other democracies and therefore the more democracies you have the more peaceful the world can i just sort of try to unpack that a little bit so on the democratic peace theory i guess would say that in democracies leaders are elected and the underlying assumption is most people want peace and so they will elect peacemakers so the more democracies you have the more likely you have peace and then the realist perspective what says that it doesn't matter if the majority of people want peace the structure of international politics is such that superpowers want to become more super and powerful and they do that through war you can't make that argument that you're making about democracies because if you're saying that democracies are inclined toward peace and that the electorate picks leaders who are inclined towards peace then you have to show that democracies are in general more peaceful yeah than non democracies and you can't support that argument you can find lots of evidence to support the argument that democracies don't fight other democracies so the argument i believe that you have to make if you're gonna support democratic peace theory the main argument you have to make is that liberal democracies have a healthy respect for each other and they can assess each other's intentions if you're a liberal democracy and i'm a liberal democracy we know we have value systems that argue against aggression and argue for peaceful resolution of crises and therefore given these norms we can trust each other we can know each other's intentions remember for realists like me uncertainty about intentions really helps drive the train mhmm but if you're talking about two democracies right the argument there is that they know each other's intentions and for you sure maybe democracies reduce uncertainty a little bit but not enough to stop the train i think that's right yeah that's that's right so that's democratic peace theory yes the second theory is economic interdependence theory and that's the argument that in a globalized world like the one that we live in and have lived in for a long time there's a great deal of economic interdependence and if you and i are two countries or if you and me are two countries and we're economically interdependent and we're both getting prosperous as a result of this economic intercourse the last thing that we're gonna do is start a war either one of us because who would kill the goose that lays the golden eggs it's that kind of argument so there you have an argument that economic interdependence leads to peace and then the third liberal argument has to do with institutions sometimes referred to as liberal institutionalism and this is the argument that if you can get states into institutions where they become rule abiding actors they will obey the rules that dictate that war is not acceptable so if you get them to accept the un rules on when you can and cannot initiate a war then you'll have a more peaceful world so those are the liberal theories and as you can tell they're very different from realism as articulated by somebody like me can you maybe argue against the economic interdependence and in the institutions that institutions follow rules a little bit so the the the golden goose with the golden egg you're saying that nations are happy to kill the goose because again they want power if they think it's necessary to kill the golden goose yeah because of security concerns they will do it the point is that economic interdependence at its root has prosperity as the core variable yeah in the realest story the core variable is survival and survival always trumps prosperity so if you go back to the period before world war one we're in europe it's nineteen thirteen or early nineteen fourteen what you see is that you have an intense security competition between all of the great powers on one side you have the triple alliance and on the other side you have the triple entente you have these two alliances and you have an intense security competition between them okay at the same time you have a great deal of economic interdependence it's amazing how much economic intercourse is taking place in europe among all the actors mhmm right and people are getting prosperous our countries are getting prosperous as a result but nevertheless in the famous july crisis of nineteen fourteen this economic prosperity is unable to prevent world war one because security concerns or survival is more important so there are you know going to be lots of situations where prosperity and survival come into conflict and in those cases survival will win and maybe you can speak to the different camps of realists you said offensive and defensive can you draw a distinction between those two yeah let me just back up a bit on that one and you were talking about will to power before the first big divide between realists is structural realists and human nature realists nice mhmm and hans morgenthau who was influenced by nature and therefore had that will to power logic embedded in his thinking about how the world works right he was a human nature realist mhmm okay i'm a structural realist and i believe it's not human nature it's it's not individuals and some will to power that drives competition and war what drives competition and war is the structure of the system it's anarchy so you're not as romantic as the human nature realist yeah there's just a a world of difference between the two sure it's just important to understand that so within that this from the structural there's a subdivision also of offensive and defensive yes inside the structural realist world right and you have a handful of realists who believe that the structure of the system fosters competition for sure security competition but it really rules out great power war almost all the time mhmm so it makes sense to care about the balance of power but to focus on maintaining how much power you have that's the defensive realism maintaining how much power you have not trying to gain more power because the argument the defensive realist make is that if you try to gain more power the system will punish you the structure will punish you i'm not a defensive realist i'm an offensive realist and my argument is that states look for opportunities to gain more power and every time they see or almost every time they see an opportunity to gain more power and they think the likelihood of success is high and the cost will not be great they'll jump at that opportunity just to link on the human nature perspective how do you explain hitler and nazi germany just one of the more recent aggressive expansions through military might how do you explain that in the framework of offensive realism well i think that nazi germany was driven in large part by structural considerations and i think if you look at imperial germany which was largely responsible for starting world war one and of course nazi germany is largely responsible for for starting world war two what that tells you is you didn't need adolf hitler to start world war one right and i believe that there is a good chance you would have had world war two in the absence of hitler right i believe that germany was very powerful it was deeply worried about the balance of power in europe and it had strong incentives to behave aggressively in the late nineteen thirties early nineteen forties so i believe that structure mattered however i wanna qualify that in the case of adolf hitler because i do think he had what you would call a will to power i've never used that word to describe him before but it's consistent with my point that i often make that there are two leaders or there have been two leaders in modern history who are congenital aggressors and one was napoleon and the other was hitler now if you wanna call that a will to power you can do that i i'm more comfortable referring to hitler as a congenital aggressor and referring to napoleon as a congenital aggressor although there were important differences between the two because hitler was probably the most murderous leader in recorded history and napoleon was not in that category at all but but both of them were driven by what you would call a will to power and that has to be married to the structural argument in hitler's case and also in napoleon's case is there some degree on the human psychology side that resentment because of how because of what happened after world war one led to hitler wielding so much power and then hitler starting world war two so this is the the human side perhaps the reason i asked that question is also because you mentioned the century of humiliation on the china side so to so to which degree does humiliation lead to hitler and lead to world war two well the question of what led to hitler is a very different question than the question of what led to world war two once hitler was in power i mean after january thirtieth nineteen thirty three he's in power and then the question of what is driving him comes racing to the fore is there resentment over the versailles treaty and what happened to germany mhmm yes did that matter yes but my argument is that structure was the principal factor driving the train in in hitler's case but what i'm saying here is that there were other factors that well as well resentment being one of them will to power or the fact that he was a congenital aggressor in my lexicon certainly mattered as well so i i don't wanna dismiss your point about resentment so hitler in particular the way he wielded the way he gained so much power might have been the general resentment of the populace of the german populace i think that as a result of defeat in world war one and all the trials and tribulations associated with weimar germany and then the coming of the great depression all of those factors definitely account for his coming to power i think that one of the reasons that he was so successful at winning over the german people once he came to power was because there was a great deal of resentment in the german body politic and he played on that resentment that surely helped him get elected too but i think having studied the case it was even more important once he took over i also believe that one of the principal reasons that he was so popular and he was wildly popular inside nazi germany is because he was the only leader of an industrialized country who pulled his country out of the depression and that really mattered and it made him very effective it's also worth noting that he was a remarkably charismatic individual i find that hard to believe because every time i look at him or listen to his speeches he does not appear to be charismatic to me but i've talked to a number of people who are experts on this subject who assure me that he was very charismatic and i would note to you if you look at public opinion polls in germany west germany in the late nineteen forties this is the late nineteen forties after the third reich is destroyed in nineteen forty five he is still remarkably popular in the polls stalin is still popular in many parts of eastern europe yeah yeah and stalin's popular in many quarters inside russia and stalin murdered more of his own people than he murdered people outside of the soviet union and still to you the ties of history turn not on individuals but on structural considerations so so hitler may be a surface layer characteristics of how germany started war but not really the reason well history is a multidimensional phenomenon so i hear and we're we're talking about interstate relations yes and realism is a theory about how states interact with each other and there are many other dimensions to international politics and if you're talking about someone like like adolf hitler right why did he start world war two is a very different question than why did he start the holocaust or why did he push forward a holocaust i mean that's you know a different question and realism doesn't answer that question so i wanna be very clear that you know i'm not someone who argues that realism answers every question about international politics but it does answer what is you know one of the big if not the biggest questions that ir scholars care about which is what causes security competition and what causes great power war does offensive realism answer the question why hitler attacked the soviet union yes because from a military strategy perspective you know there's pros and cons to that decision pros and cons to every decision the question is did he think that he could win a quick and decisive victory and he did i mean as did his generals it's very interesting i i've spent a lot of time studying german decision making mhmm in world war two if you look at the german decision to invade poland on september first nineteen thirty nine and you look at the german decision invade france on may tenth nineteen forty and then the soviet union on june twenty second nineteen forty one what you see is there was actually quite a bit of resistance to hitler in nineteen thirty eight at the time of czechoslovakia munich and there was also quite a bit of resistance in september nineteen thirty nine internally or you mean internally internally for sure yeah yeah people had doubts they didn't think the wehrmacht was ready and given the fact that world war one had just ended about twenty years before the thought of starting another european war was not especially attractive to lots of german policymakers including military leaders and then came france nineteen forty in the run up to may tenth nineteen forty there was huge resistance in the german army to attacking france but that was eventually eliminated because they came up with a clever plan the manstein plan if you look at the decision to invade the soviet union on june twenty second nineteen forty one which is the only case where they fail they succeeded in france they succeeded in poland they succeeded at munich in nineteen thirty eight soviet union is where they fail there's hardly any resistance at all right yeah well and to say that they failed the soviet union i mean my grandfather fought i mean from from the soviet union you know there's a lot of successes early on so there's poor military i would say strategic decisions along the way but it was it caught stalin off guard maybe you can correct me but from my perspective terrifyingly so they could have been successful if certain different decisions were made from a military perspective yeah i've always had the sense they came terrifyingly close to winning yeah you can make the opposite argument that they were doomed but i i i'm not terribly comfortable making that argument i think the wehrmacht by the summer of nineteen forty one was a finely tuned instrument for war and the red army was in quite terrible shape stalin had purged the officer corps they had performed poor poorly in finland and there were all sorts of reasons to think that they were no match for the wehrmacht and if you look at what happened in the initial stages of the conflict that proved to be the case the germans won a lot of significant tactical victories early on and if they focused and went to moscow as quickly as possible it's again terrifyingly so could have been a a basically topple topple stalin and one thing that's that's possible that's possible fortunately we're not gonna run the experiment again but yeah one could argue that that had they concentrated as the generals wanted to do in going straight for moscow that they would have won i mean what hitler wanted to do is he he wanted to go into the ukraine i mean hitler thought that the main axis there were three axes the northern axis went towards leningrad the central axis of course went to moscow and then the southern axis army group south headed towards ukraine and deep into the caucasus and hitler believed that that that should have been the main axis and in fact in nineteen forty two the soviets excuse me the germans go back on the offensive in nineteen forty two this is operation blue and the main axis in forty two is deep and into the caucasus mhmm and that fails but one could argue that had they done that in forty one had they not gone to moscow had they gone you know had they concentrated on going deep into ukraine and into the caucasus they could have knocked the soviets out that way i'm i'm not sure that in the end i believe that i i think in the end the soviets would have won no matter what but i'm not a hundred percent sure of that so sometimes maybe you can educate me but sometimes you know they say just like when napoleon winter defeated hitler in in russia i think not often enough people tell the story of the of the soldiers and the the motivation and how hard they fight so it turns out that ukrainians and russians are not easy to conquer they're the kinds of people that don't roll over and fight bravely there seems to be a difference in certain people peoples in how they see war how they approach war how proud they are to fight for their country to die for their country these kinds of things so i think battle of stalingrad tells at least to me a story of extremely brave fighting on the soviet side and that that it's a component of war too it's not just structural it's not just military strategy it's also the humans involved but maybe that's a romantic notion of war no i i think there's a great deal of truth in that but let's just unpack it a bit in the case of the soviet union in world war two the counterargument to that is that in world war one the russian army disintegrated and if you look at what happened when napoleon invaded in eighteen twelve and you look at what happened in nineteen seventeen and then you look at what happened between forty one and forty five the napoleon case looks a lot like the hitler case and it fits neatly with your argument but world war one does not fit neatly with your argument because the russians lost and surrendered yeah and you had the infamous treaty of brest litovsk where the soviet union then because it went from russia to the soviet union in october nineteen seventeen the soviet union surrendered large amounts of soviet territory because it had suffered a humiliating defeat my argument for why the russians let me take that back why the soviets fought like wild dogs in world war two is that they were up against the genocidal adversary you wanna understand that the germans murdered huge numbers of soviet pows the overall total was three point seven million and by december december of nineteen forty one remember the invasion is june forty one by december of nineteen forty one the germans have murdered two million soviet pows at that point in time they had murdered many more pows than they had murdered jews and this is not to deny for one second that they were on a murderous rampage when it came to jews but they were also on a murderous rampage when it came to soviet citizens and soviet soldiers right so those soviet soldiers quickly came to understand that they were fighting for their lives if they were taken prisoner they would die so they fought like wild dogs yeah you know the story of the holocaust of the six million jews is often told extensively if hitler won conquer the soviet union it's terrifying to think on a much grander scale than the holocaust what what would have happened to the slavic people to the to the soviet people absolutely all you have to do is read the hunger plan right and they also had a plan what's it called grand plan east i forget the exact name of it which made it clear that they they were gonna murder many tens of millions of people and by the way i believe that they would have murdered all the poles and all the roma i mean my view is that the jews were number one on the genocidal hit list the roma or the gypsies were number two and the poles were number three and of course i just explained to you how many pows they had killed so they would have ended up murdering huge numbers of soviet citizens as well but people quickly figured out that this was happening mhmm that's my point to you and that gave them needless to say very powerful incentives to fight hard against the germans and to make sure that they did not win to fast forward in time but not in space let me ask you about the war in ukraine why did russia invade ukraine on february twenty fourth twenty twenty two what are some of the explanations given and which do you find the most convincing well clearly the conventional wisdom is that putin is principally responsible putin is an imperialist he's an expansionist he's that's the conventional thinking yeah yeah and the idea is that he he is bent on creating a greater russia and even more so he's interested in dominating eastern europe if not all of europe and that ukraine was the first stop on the train line and what he wanted to do was to conquer all of ukraine incorporate it into a greater russia and then he would move on and conquer other countries this is the conventional wisdom my view is there is no evidence let me emphasize zero evidence to support that argument which part that he would the imperialist part the sense that he would he sought to conquer all of ukraine and move on and conquer there's no evidence he was interested in conquering all of ukraine there was no interested there's no evidence beforehand that he was interested in conquering conquering any of ukraine and there's no way that an army that had a hundred and ninety thousand troops at the most right could have conquered all of ukraine just impossible as i like to emphasize when the germans went into poland in nineteen thirty nine and the germans you wanna remember were only intent on conquering the western half of poland because the soviets who came in later that month were gonna conquer the eastern half of poland so the western half of poland is much smaller than ukraine and the germans went in with one point five million troops if vladimir putin were bent on conquering all of ukraine he would have needed at least two million troops i would argue he'd need three million troops because not only do you need to conquer the country you then have to occupy it but the idea that a hundred ninety thousand troops was sufficient for conquering all of ukraine is not a serious argument furthermore he was not interested in conquering ukraine and that's why in march twenty twenty two this is immediately after the war starts he is negotiating with zelensky to end the war there are serious negotiations taking place in istanbul involving the turks and naftali bennett who was the israeli prime minister at the time was deeply involved in negotiating with both putin and zelensky to end the war well if he was interested putin in conquering all of ukraine why in god's name would he be negotiating with zelensky to end the war and of course what they were negotiating about was nato expansion into ukraine which was the principal cause of the war people in the west don't wanna hear that argument because if it is true which it is then the west is principally responsible for this bloodbath that's now taking place and of course the west doesn't want to be principally responsible it wants to blame vladimir putin mhmm so we've invented this story out of whole cloth that he is an aggressor that he's the second coming of adolf hitler and that what he did in ukraine was try to to conquer all of it and he failed but with a little bit of luck he probably would have conquered all of it and he'd now be in the baltic states and eventually end up dominating all of eastern europe as i said i think there's no evidence to support this so maybe there's a lot of things to ask there maybe just to linger on nato expansion what is nato expansion what is the threat of nato expansion and why is it such a concern for russia nato was a mortal enemy of the soviet union during the cold war it's a military alliance which has at its heart the united states of america which is the most powerful state on the planet it is perfectly understandable that russia is not going to want that military alliance on its doorstep here in the united states we have as you well know what's called the monroe doctrine and that basically says no great powers from europe or asia are allowed to come into our neighborhood and form a military alliance with anybody in this neighborhood when i was young there was this thing called the cuban missile crisis the soviets had the audacity to put nuclear armed missiles in cuba we told them in no uncertain terms that that was not acceptable and that those missiles had to be removed this is our backyard and we do not tolerate distant great powers coming into our neighborhood well what's good for the goose is good for the gander and if we don't like great powers coming into our neighborhood it's hardly surprising that the russians did not want nato on their door step they made that manifestly clear when the cold war ended and they exacted a promise from us that we would not expand nato and then when we started expanding nato they made it clear after the first tranche in nineteen ninety nine that they were profoundly unhappy with that they made it clear in two thousand four after the second tranche that they were profoundly unhappy with that expansion and then in april two thousand eight when nato announced that ukraine and georgia would become part of nato they made it unequivocally clear not just putin that that was not gonna happen they were drawing a red line in the sand and it is no accident that in august two thousand eight remember the bucharest summit is april two thousand eight in august two thousand eight you had a war between georgia and russia and that involved at its core nato expansion so the americans and their allies should have understood by at least august two thousand eight that continuing to push to bring ukraine into nato was going to lead to disaster and i would note that there were all sorts of people in the nineteen nineties like george kennan william perry who was bill clinton's secretary of defense the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff paul nitze and so forth and so on who argued that nato expansion would end up producing a disaster which it has i would note that at the famous april two thousand eight bucharest summit where nato said that ukraine would be brought into the alliance angela merkel and nicholas sarkozy the german and french leaders respectively opposed that decision angela merkel later said that the reason she opposed it was because she understood that putin would interpret it as a declaration of war just think about that merkel is telling you that she opposed nato expansion into ukraine because she understood correctly that putin would see it as a declaration of war what did the united states and its friend friends in europe do they continued to push and push because we thought that we could push nato expansion down their throat after two thousand eight the same way we did in nineteen ninety nine and two thousand four but we were wrong and it all blew up in our face in two thousand fourteen and when it blew up in our face in two thousand fourteen what did we do did we back off and say well maybe the russians have some legitimate security interest no that's not the way we operate we continue to double down and the end result is that in two thousand twenty two you got a war and as i've argued for a long time now we the west are principally responsible for that not vladimir putin so the expansion of nato is primarily responsible for the to put it in more general terms what we were trying to do was turn ukraine into a western bulwark on russia's border and it really wasn't nato expansion alone nato expansion was the most important element of our strategy but the strategy had two other dimensions one was eu expansion and the third was the color revolution we were trying to force orange revolution in ukraine and the basic goal there was to turn ukraine into a pro western liberal democracy and that meant that you'd have ukraine if it worked as a pro western liberal democracy that was in the eu and that was in nato this was our goal and the russians made it unequivocally clear ukraine was not gonna become a western bulwark on their border and most importantly they made it clear that ukraine and nato was unacceptable can we talk about the mind of vladimir putin you've mentioned that this idea that he has aspirations for imperialist conquest that he dreams of empire is not grounded in reality he wrote an essay in twenty twenty one about one people do you think there is some degree to which he still dreams of the former soviet union reuniting no he's made it clear that anybody with a a triple digit iq understands that it's nuts to think about recreating the soviet union he thinks it's a tragedy that the soviet union fell apart mhmm but as he made clear in that essay the july twelfth twenty twenty one essay and has he made clear in speeches before immediately before he invaded ukraine he accepted the breakup of the soviet union and he accepted the status quo in europe save for the fact he did not accept the idea that ukraine would become part of nato he's been in power for over two decades is there a degree that power can affect a leader's ability to see the world clearly as they say corrupt do you think power has corrupted vladimir putin to a degree it's very hard for me to answer that question because i don't know him and i've not studied him carefully in terms of his overall performance over the course of you know the twenty three years that he's been in power i've studied him as a strategist and i've studied how he you know deals with the west and you know deals with the international system more generally since two thousand fourteen and i think he is a first class strategist this is not to say he doesn't make mistakes and he admits he's made some mistakes but i think that the west is dealing with a formidable adversary here and i don't see any evidence that he's either lost speed off his fastball or that power has corrupted his thinking about strategic affairs so he has consistently put as a primary concern security as does the united states he's put for russia security making sure that nato doesn't get close to its borders i think that's clear yeah i i think as i emphasized early on in our conversation that leaders privilege security or survival over everything else and by the way he gave a number of talks and press conferences in addition to writing that famous article that you referred to on july twelve twenty twenty one so we have you know a pretty clear record of what he was saying and i would argue what he was thinking in the run up to the war in february twenty twenty two and if you read what he said it's quite clear that he privileged security or survival he was deeply concerned about the security of russia and russia is a quite vulnerable state in a lot of ways especially if you think back to what it looked like in the nineteen nineties as you know better than i do it was in terrible shape the chinese talk about the century of national humiliation one could argue that for the russians that was the decade of national humiliation and and it took putin i think quite a bit of time to bring the russians back from the dead i think he eventually succeeded but it took a considerable amount of time and i think he understood that he was not playing a particularly strong hand he was playing something of a weak hand and he had to be very careful very cautious and i think he was and i think that's very different than the united states the united states was the unipole it was the most powerful state in the history of the world most powerful state relative to all its possible competitors from you know roughly nineteen eighty nine certainly after december nineteen ninety one when the soviet union fell apart up until i would argue about two thousand seventeen we were incredibly powerful and even after two thousand seventeen up to today the united states remains the most powerful state in the system and because of our geographical location we are in a terrific situation to survive in any great power competition so you have a situation involving the united states that's different than the situation involving russia they're they're just much more vulnerable than we are and and therefore i think putin tends to be more sensitive about security than any american president in recent times europe on one side china on the other side it's a complicated situation yeah and we talked before about eighteen twelve when napoleon invaded and moscow got burned to the ground we talked about world war one where the russians were actually defeated and surrendered and then we talked about nineteen forty one to nineteen forty five where although thankfully the soviets prevailed it was it it was a close call and i mean the casualties the destruction that the soviet union had inflicted on it by the germans is just almost almost hard to believe so they are sensitive you can understand full well or at least you should be able to understand full well why the idea of bringing ukraine up to their border really spooked them i don't understand why more americans don't understand that it's just it it befuddles me i think it has to do with the fact that americans are not very good at putting themselves in the shoes of other countries and you really if if you're gonna be a first class strategist in international politics you have to be able to do that you have to put yourself in the shoes of the other side and think about how they think so you don't make foolish mistakes and as a starting point americans tend to see themselves as the good guys and a a set of others as the bad guys and you have to be able to empathize that russians think of themselves as the good guys the chinese think of themselves as the good guys and just be able to empathize if they are the good guys it's like that funny skit are we the baddies consider the united states could be the bad guys like first of all like see the world if the united states is the bad guys and china is the good guys what does that world look like be able to just exist with that thought because that is what the chinese lit leadership and many chinese citizens if not now maybe in the future will believe and you have to kind of do the calculation the simulation forward from that and same with russia same with with other nations yeah i agree with you a hundred percent and just you know i always think of michael mcfaul at stanford who was the american ambassador to russia i think between twenty twelve and twenty fourteen and he told me that he told putin that putin didn't have to worry about nato expansion because the united states was a benign hegemon and i asked mike what putin's response was to that and mike said that putin didn't believe it and but mike believed that he should believe it and that we could move nato eastward to include ukraine and in the end we'd get away with it because we are a benign hegemon but the fact is that's not what putin saw putin saw us as a malign hegemon and what mike thinks or any american thinks doesn't matter what matters is what putin thinks but also the drums of war have been beating for some reason nato expansion has been threatened for some reason so you've talked about nato expansion being dead so like the it doesn't make sense from a geopolitical perspective on the europe side to expand nato but nevertheless that threat has been echoed so why has nato expansion been pushed from your perspective there are two reasons one is first of all we thought it was a wonderful thing to bring more and more countries into nato we thought that it facilitated peace and prosperity it was ultimately all for the good and we also thought that countries like ukraine had a right to join nato these are sovereign countries that can decide for themselves and the russians have no say in what ukraine wants to do and then finally and this is a point i emphasized before we were very powerful and we thought we could shove it down their throat so so it's it's a combination of those factors that led us to pursue what i think was ultimately a foolish policy we've talked about how wars get started how do you hope the war in ukraine ends what are the ways to end this war what are the ways to achieve peace there to end the the i would say senseless death of young men as always happens in war i i'm sad to say i don't have a good answer to that i i don't think there's any real prospect of a meaningful peace agreement i think it's almost impossible i i think the best you can hope for at this point is at some some point the shooting stops you have a ceasefire and then you have a frozen conflict and that frozen conflict will not be highly stable and the ukrainians and the west will do everything they can to weaken russia's position and the russians will go to great lengths to not only damage that dysfunctional rump state that ukraine becomes but the russians will go to great lengths to sow dissension within the alliance and and that includes in terms of transatlantic relations so you'll have this continuing security competition between russia on one side and ukraine and the west on the other even when you get a frozen peace and or you get a frozen conflict and and and and the potential for escalation there will be great so i think this is a disaster that's a very realist perspective let me ask you sort of the the human side of it do you think there's some power to leaders sitting down having a conversation man to man leader to leader about this there's there there is just a lot of death happening it seems that from a economic perspective from a historic from a human perspective both nations are losing is it possible for vladimir zelensky and and and vladimir putin to sit down and talk and to figure out a way where the security concerns are addressed and both nations can minimize the amount of suffering that's happening and and and create a a path towards future flourishing i think the answer is no even with the united states involved three people in the room well i think if the united states is involved the answer is definitely no you have to get the americans out and then i i think if you have zelensky and putin talking you know you have a sliver of a chance there the americans are a real problem look let's go back to what happens right after the war starts okay as i said before this is we're talking march early april of twenty twenty two the war starts on february twenty fourth twenty twenty two and as i said to you the two sides were negotiating in istanbul and they were also negotiating through naftali bennett and the what happened what happened bennett tells the story very clearly that they had made significant progress in reaching an agreement this is zelensky on one side and putin on the other bennett is talking in person to both putin and zelensky and what happens to produce failure the answer is the united states and britain get involved and tell zelensky to walk they tell zelensky to walk if they had come in and encouraged zelensky to try to figure out a way with putin to shut this one down and worked with bennett and worked with erdogan mhmm we might have been able to shut the war down then but it was the united states well let me sort of push back on that you're you're correct but you so united states paints this like picture that everybody's aligned so i maybe you can correct me but i believe in the power of individuals especially individual leaders again whether it's biden or trump or whoever goes into a room and says in a way that's convincing that no more nato expansion and actually just in a basic human level ask the question of why are we doing all this senseless killing and look at the interest of one russia look at the interest of the other ukraine their interests are pretty simple and say united states is gonna stay out of this we're not going to expand nato and say all that in a way that's convincing which is nato expansion in syria at this point china is the big threat we're not going to do this kind of conflict escalation with russia the cold war is over let's let's normalize relations let me just embellish your argument mhmm okay thank you the the i need it if we say there's a sliver of a chance yes that you can do this and i do think there is a sliver of a chance let me just embellish your point thank you i need all the help i can get two things have to be done here in my opinion one is ukraine has to become neutral and it it has to completely sever all security ties with the west right it's it's not like you can say we're not gonna expand nato to include ukraine but we're gonna continue to have some loose security arrangement with ukraine none of that it has to be completely severed ukraine has to be on its own okay and number two ukraine has to accept the fact that the russians are gonna keep the four oblas that they've now annexed in crimea right the russians are not gonna give them back and what you really wanna do if you're zelensky or who's ever running ukraine in this scenario that we're positing is you wanna make sure the russians don't take another four oblast to include our kyiv and odessa right if i'm playing putin's hand and this war goes on i'm thinking about taking four more oblas i wanna take about forty three percent of ukraine and an exit to russia right and i certainly want odessa and i certainly want kharkiv and i i i want the two obas in between as well right literally or as leverage and negotiation no i ukraine neutrality i want them literally i i wanna conquer them literally but my point to you is if we can begin to talk about cutting a deal now you may be able to head that kind of aggression off at the pass in other words you may be able to limit putin and russia to annexing the four o boss that they've now annexed plus crimea that's the best i think you can hope for but the point is you have to get the ukrainians to accept that you have to get the ukrainians to accept becoming a truly neutral state and conceding that the russians keep a big chunk of territory it's about twenty three percent of ukrainian territory that they annexed and i find it hard to imagine any ukrainian leader agreeing to that well there there there could be more nuanced things like no military involvement between the united states and ukraine but economic involvement sort of financial support sort of normalizing economic relationships with ukraine with russia all the i think you could probably get away with i i think that the the tricky question there that you would have to answer is what about eu expansion right and i think eu expansion is probably a no no for the russians because most people don't recognize this but there is a military dimension built in to eu expansion mhmm it's not purely an economic alliance or relationship actually in the run up to the two thousand fourteen crisis when it first broke out the russians made it clear they saw eu expansion as a stalking horse for nato expansion so eu expansion is tricky but i i think your point of close economic relations between or healthy economic relations to use a better term between ukraine and the west is possible i i i think the russians have a vested interest in if if it's a neutral ukraine they have a vested interest in that ukraine flourishing but that then brings us back to the territorial issue right well so do you believe it's possible for individual human relations to counteract the structural forces that you talk about so meaning the leaders being able to pick up the phone and make agreements that are good for humanity as a whole and for their individual nations in the long term i think leadership matters here i mean one of the real problems here is that there's no trust and on the russian side and that has to do with the minsk agreements the the minsk agreements which were designed to shut down the civil war in eastern ukraine in the donbas really mattered to the russians and there were four players involved in the the minsk process four main players russia and ukraine of course and then germany and france and i believe the russians took the minsk accord seriously i believe putin took them very seriously he wanted to shut down that conflict and angela merkel francois hollande he was the french leader and poroshenko who was the ukrainian leader those were the three key players besides putin again hollande from france merkel from germany and poroshenko from ukraine have all explicitly said they were not seriously interested in reaching an agreement in all the discussions with putin they were bamboozling him they were trying to trick him so that they would buy time to build up ukraine's military putin is profoundly upset about these admissions by these three leaders he believes he was fooled into thinking that mitts could work he believes that he negotiated in good faith and they did not and he believes that the level of trust now between russia and the west is virtually zero as a result of this experience over minsk i only bring this up because it cuts against your argument that leaders could pick up the phone and talk to each other and trust each other at least somewhat to work out a meaningful deal if you're putin at this point in time trusting the west is not an idea that's gonna be very attractive at all in fact you're gonna distrust anything they say yeah distrust anything the west say but there is individual humans the way human nature works is when you sit in the cross from a person you can trust a human being while still distrusting the west i mean i i i believe in the power of that it i i think with the right leaders you could sit down and talk like over override the general structural distrust of the west and say you know what i like this guy or gal whatever i do hope zelensky and putin sit down together and talk have multiple talks just remember they were doing that in march and the americans came in and the british came in yeah and they scotched a potential deal well the other beautiful thing about human nature there's forgiveness and there's trying again when you're the leader of a country in an anarchic system you have to be very careful not to let your trust in a foreign leader take you too far because if that foreign leader betrays you or betrays your trust and stabs you in the back you could die and again you wanna remember that the principal responsibility of any leader i don't care what country it is is to ensure the survival of their state and that means that you know trust is only gonna buy you so much and when you've already betrayed the trust of a leader you really are not gonna be able to rely on trust very much to help you moving forward now you disagree with that i hope you're right and if they can shut down the ukraine russia war it would be wonderful if i'm proved dead wrong that would be wonderful news my my prediction that this war is gonna go on for a long time and and end in an ugly way is a prediction that i don't like at all so i hope i'm wrong you wrote that many in the west believe that the best hope for for ending the ukraine war is to remove vladimir putin from power but you argue that this isn't the case can you explain well a lot of people thought when they were having all that trouble the russians were having all that trouble with pergochen and the wagner group that putin was vulnerable and was likely to be overthrown and what would happen is a peace loving leader would replace putin i made two points at the time and i would make those same two points now number one he's not likely to be overthrown mhmm he was not likely then to be overthrown and i think you know as long as his health holds up i think he will remain in power my second point is if he doesn't remain in power and he's replaced i would bet a lot of money that his replacement will be more hawkish and more hard line than putin is i actually think one could argue that putin was too trusting of the west before the war started and number two i think one could argue that he has not waged the war against ukraine as vigorously as one might have expected he was slow to mobilize the nation for war and he has pursued a limited war in all sorts of ways the israelis for example have killed more civilians in gaza in one month than the russians have killed over eighteen months in ukraine the idea that vladimir putin is waging a punishment campaign and killing on purpose large numbers of civilians is simply not true all this is to say that i would imagine that if putin leaves office and someone else comes in to replace him that someone else will be at least if not more hard line than him in terms of waging the war and certainly will not trust the west any more than he has by way of advice let me ask you if i were to have a conversation interview vladimir putin and zelensky individually what should i ask them if you me and vladimir putin are having a chat what are good ideas to explore what are good questions to ask what are good things to say on or off the mic once again that could potentially even slightly lessen the amount of suffering in the world caused by this war oh i think if you get an interview with vladimir putin there's just all sorts of questions you could ask him and my sense is that putin is a straight shooter he's also very knowledgeable about history and he has simple theories in his head about how the world works and i think he would level with you and all you would have to do is just you know figure out what all the right questions are and that would not be hard to do right you know you could ask him why was he so foolish this is for for example why was he so foolish is to trust poroshenko hollande and merkel in the minsk accords you know why after his famous talk at munich in two thousand seven where he made it clear that he was so unhappy with the west did he continue to you know in a very important way trust the west why didn't he mobilize the russian military before late september twenty twenty two you know once the negotiations that we were talking about before involving istanbul and naftali bennett once they broke down you know why didn't he immediately mobilize more of the russian population to fight the war just all sorts of questions like that and then you could ask him questions about you know where he sees this one headed what's the best strategy for russia if the ukrainians will not agree to neutrality right you know people like john mearsheimer say you'll probably take close to half of ukraine is that true does it make sense to take odessa and john mearsheimer also has questions about china your future relationships with china yeah i mean one really important question that i would ask him is if the united states had basically not driven you into the arms of the chinese if there had been no war over ukraine and the united states had and its european allies had gone to considerable lengths to create some sort of security architecture in europe that resulted in you vladimir putin having good relations with ukraine what would your relations with china be and you know how would you think about that so there there are just plenty of questions you could ask him well hope burns eternal in my heart i think probably in putin's heart and zelensky's heart i hope because hope is the leap of trust that we've talked about i think is necessary for de escalation and for peace well you realize i have from the beginning argued for different policies that were all designed to prevent this war from ever happening yes i don't know if you know this but in nineteen ninety three i argued that ukraine should keep its nuclear weapons i was probably the only person in the west who made that argument and my argument in nineteen ninety three this is in foreign affairs was that there may come the day when russia thinks about invading ukraine and should that day come it would be very helpful for preventing war if ukraine had nuclear weapons so military might is essential for maintaining a balance of power and peace well if you're interested in deterring an adversary if i'm worried about you coming after me the best way to deter you is to have military might and if you're russia and i'm ukraine i'm far weaker than you yeah right and having a nuclear deterrent would be very effective at convincing you not to attack me because if you attack me you're threatening my survival and that's the one circumstance where it is likely that i would use nuclear weapons to defend myself and given the consequences of nuclear use you would be reluctant in the extreme to attack me so that's why i argued in ninety three that if ukraine kept its nuclear weapons that made war down the road much less likely and i believe i was correct and in fact bill clinton who played the key role in forcing ukraine to give up its nuclear weapons now says he has said it publicly you can find it on youtube that he made a mistake doing that furthermore i argued in two thousand fourteen that it made eminently good sense not to continue to push to bring ukraine into nato because the end result is that ukraine would be destroyed and ukraine is being destroyed so i was deeply interested at time in making sure that that didn't happen for the good of the ukrainians not to mention because stability in europe is a net positive for almost everybody involved but people did not listen to me then either how do nuclear weapons change the calculus of offensive realism because of mutually assured destruction i mean it's not just military might it's just so destructive that you basically can't use nuclear weapons unless you want complete destruction there's no question that the presence of nuclear weapons makes it much less likely i'm choosing my words carefully here much less likely that a great power would aggress against another great power it doesn't take that possibility off the table but it makes it much less likely because of the reasons that you articulated but with regard to nuclear use it's an interesting question how you think about nuclear use in a mad world i mean your point that we're in a mad world is that's mad capital m a d as well as m a d small letters but let's stick to the capital letters we're in a world of mutual assured destruction there's no question that in that world it's unlikely that nuclear weapons would be used but the way you use nuclear weapons in that world is you use them for manipulation or risk purposes demonstration effect you you you put both sides out on the slippery slope now what exactly am i saying here let me talk about nato doctrine during the cold war we lived in a mad world united states and soviet union or the warsaw pact and nato both had an assured destruction capability so you had mutual assured destruction if the warsaw pact were to invade western europe and here we're talking about west germany and nato was losing the war we said that we would use nuclear weapons how would we use nuclear weapons given that we were in a mad world the argument was that we would use a handful of nuclear weapons against the warsaw pact not through not necessarily against their military forces could be in a remote area we would use a small number of nuclear weapons mhmm to signal to the soviets that we were deadly serious about putting an end to their offensive and that we were throwing both sides out on the slippery slope to oblivion mhmm in other words we were manipulating risk and the last clear chance to avoid armageddon rested with them mhmm and then we would tell them that if you retaliated with a handful of nuclear weapons and you didn't cease your offensive against west germany we would launch a small another nuclear attack we would explode a handful more of nuclear weapons all for the purposes of showing you our resolve right so this is the manipulation of risk strategy and a lot of the language i just used in describing it to you is language that thomas schelling invented mhmm right now fast forward to the present if russia were you losing in ukraine that's the one scenario where i think where russia would have used nuclear weapons and the question is how would russia have used nuclear weapons again we're assuming that the russians are losing to the ukrainians i believe they would have pursued a manipulation risk strategy mhmm they would have used four or five three or four who knows nuclear weapons maybe just one in a rural area that kills very few people yes exactly and basically that would spook everybody the americans just the mushroom cloud yeah the it it's because of the threat of escalation right again your point is we're in a mad world i accept that and if you have limited nuclear use right we understand hardly anything about nuclear escalation because thank goodness we've never had a nuclear war so once you throw both sides out on the slippery slope even if you only use one nuclear weapon in your scenario you don't know what the escalation dynamics look like so everybody has a powerful incentive to put an end to the conflict right away mhmm i might add to you that there were people who believed that we would not even initiate a manipulation of risk strategy in europe if we were losing to the warsaw pact during the cold war both henry kissinger and robert mcnamara said after leaving office that they would not have done it they would have not initiated nuclear use even limited nuclear use that's what we're talking about here they would rather be red than dead right that was the argument too risky too risky that's exactly right but if they had used one nuclear weapon in your story or three or four in my story everybody would have said oh my god we've got to shut this one down immediately i only tell you this story or lay out this scenario as an answer to your question of how you use nuclear weapons in a mad world and this is the answer i this is all very terrifying perhaps in part it's terrifying to me because i can see in the twenty first century china russia israel united states using a nuclear weapon in this way blowing it up somewhere in the middle of nowhere that kills maybe nobody but i'm terrified of seeing the mushroom cloud and not knowing what you know given social media given how fast news travels what the escalation looks like there just you know in in a in a in a matter of minutes how the news travels and how the leaders react it's terrifying that this this little demonstration of power the ripple effects of it in a matter of minutes seconds what that leads to because it's like it's human emotions it's like you you see the landscape of human emotions the leaders and the populace and the and the way news are reported and then the landscape of risk as you mentioned shifting like the world's most intense nonlinear dynamical system and it it it's just terrifying because the the the the entirety of human civilizations hangs in the balance there and it's like like this like hundreds of millions of people could be dead let's just talk about this in the context of the ukraine war if if the russians were losing as i said before which is not the case anymore but in twenty twenty two it it did look like that if the russians are losing and they turn to nuclear weapons the question is how do they use them and they would use them in ukraine and because ukraine has no nuclear weapons of its own ukraine cannot retaliate it's not a mutual assured destruction world it's a case where one side has nuclear weapons and the other doesn't that means that the russians are likely to think that they can get away with using nuclear weapons in ways that would not be the case if they were attacking nato and therefore it makes nuclear use more likely okay that's point one point two is let's assume that the russians use two or three nuclear weapons in a remote area my boss is sweating by the way just just as a commentary the question terrifying yeah the question then is what does the west do now macron has said and biden has also i think implicitly made this clear we would not retaliate with nuclear weapons if the russians were to attack with a handful of nuclear weapons in western ukraine but then the question is what would we do mhmm and if you listen to david petraeus what david petraeus says is that we should attack the russian naval assets in the black sea and attack russian forces in ukraine well once you do that you have a great power war you have nato versus russia which is another way of saying you have the united states versus russia we're now in a great power war they have nuclear weapons we have nuclear weapons they've used nuclear weapons what is the happy ending here and just to take it a step further and go back to our earlier discussion about moving nato up to russia's borders the point i made which you surely agree with is that the russians are very fearful when they see nato coming up to their border well here's a case where not only has nato come up to their border but they're in a war with nato right on their border what do the escalation dynamics look like there you know what the answer is who knows that should scare the living bejesus out of you right and some of it could be like you mentioned unintended there could be unintended consequences there could be a russian missile misses and hits poland the the these kinds of things that just escalate misunderstandings miscommunications even a i mean nuclear weapon could be boy it could have been planned to go location x and it went to a location y that ended up actually killing a very large number of people i mean just that the the escalation that happens it just happens in a in a matter of minutes and the only way to stop that is communication between leaders and that to me is a big argument for ongoing communication you know there's a story that during the cuban missile crisis kennedy put out the word no aircraft under any circumstances or to penetrate soviet airspace yeah and he then found out a few days later that some guy hadn't gotten the message and had penetrated in an aircraft deep into soviet airspace yeah and this supports your basic point that you know bad things happen and and again the overarching point here is we've never done this before thankfully therefore we don't have a lot of experience as to how it plays itself out mhmm it it's really a theoretical enterprise because there's no empirical basis for talking about escalation you know in a nuclear crisis and that of course is a wonderful thing well in general the the human species as a whole is a is a one off is a theoretical enterprise the survival of the human species you know we've seen empires rise and fall but we haven't seen the human species rise and fall so far it's been rising but it's not obvious that it doesn't end in fact i think about aliens a lot and the fact that we don't see aliens makes me suspect it's not so easy to survive in this complicated world of ours switching gears a little bit and going to a different part of the world also engulfed in war let me ask you about the situation in israel why did hamas attack israel on october seventh twenty twenty three as you understand the situation what was the reason that attack happened well i think the main reason was that you had this suffocating occupation i think as long as the occupation persists the palestinians are going to resist as you well know this is not the first time there has been a palestinian uprising there was the first intifada there was the second intifada now there's october seventh and there are uprisings besides those three so this is not terribly surprising a lot of people hypothesized that this attack was due to the fact that the israelis the saudis and the americans were working together to foster another abraham accord and that the palestinians would in effect be sold down the river i think given the fact that this was in the planning stages for probably about two years and the abraham accords with regard to saudi arabia are relatively new phenomenon i don't think that's the main driving force here i think the main driving force is that the palestinians feel oppressed as they should and that this was a resistance move they were resisting the israeli occupation so that resistance the attack involved killing a large number of israeli civilians there's many questions to ask there but one is do you think hamas fully understood what the retaliation will involve from israel into gaza they had to understand i mean you had you know operation cast lead in two thousand eight two thousand nine it started i think right after christmas two thousand eight and it ended right before president obama took office in january two thousand nine and the israelis periodically do what they call mowing the lawn where they go into gaza and they pound the palestinians to remind them that they're not supposed to rise up and cause any problem so there's no question in my mind that the the hamas forces understood full well that the israelis would retaliate and they would retaliate in force as they have done yeah the even the metaphor of mowing the lawn is disturbing to me in many ways i actually saw norman philkestein i think say that well then if you use that metaphor then you could say that hamas was also mowing the lawn and it's such a horrific image because the result on either side is just the death of civilians i mean let me ask you about the death of civilians so during the attack fourteen hundred israelis were killed over two forty were taken hostage and then in response as we sit today israel's military response has killed over ten thousand people in gaza and given the nature of the demographics it's it's a very heavily young population over forty percent of them are under the age of eighteen of those killed that's of course according to ministry of health of palestinian authority so what do you think is the long term effect on the prospect of peace when so many civilians die i mean i think it's disastrous i mean the only way you're gonna get peace here is if you have a two state solution where the palestinians have a sovereign state of their own and there is a sovereign jewish state and these two states live side by side american presidents since jimmy carter have understood this full well and this is why we have pushed very hard for two state solution indeed many american jews and many israelis have pushed for a two state solution because they think that that is the only way you're gonna get peace between the two sides but what's happened here is that in recent years the israelis have lost all interest in a two state solution and it's in large part because the political center of gravity in israel has steadily moved to the right when i was a young boy the political center of gravity in israel was much further to the left than it is today and it it it is in it is in a position now the political center of gravity where there's hardly any support for two state solution and netanyahu and the rest of the people in his government were in favor or are in favor of a greater israel there's just no question about that well on top of that you now have had a war where as you described huge numbers of civilians have been killed and you already had bad blood between the palestinians and the israelis before this conflict and you could imagine how people on each side now feel about people on the other side so even if you didn't have this opposition inside israel to a two state solution how could you possibly get the israelis now to agree to a two state solution i think for the foreseeable future the animosity inside israel towards the palestinians is so great that it is impossible to move the israelis in that direction and the israelis here are the key players more so than the palestinians because it's the israelis who control greater israel it's the israelis who you have to convince now i wanna be clear here you also ultimately have to get around the fact that hamas right is not committed to a two state solution but i think that problem could be dealt with it's important to understand that arafat and the plo was once adamantly opposed to a two state solution but arafat came around to understand that that was really the only hope for settling this and he became a proponent of a two state solution and that's true of mahmoud abbas who runs the pa in the west bank it's not true of hamas at this point in time they want a one state solution they want a palestinian state and of course the israelis want a one state solution too which is a jewish state that controls all of all of greater israel so the question is can you get some sort of agreement and i think to get to your the the nub of your question given what's just happened it's almost impossible to imagine that happening anytime soon the cynical perspective here is that those in power benefit from conflict while the people on both sides suffer is there a degree of truth to that or for the people in power to maintain power conflict needs to continue no i i don't believe that i mean just to take the netanyahu government or any israeli government that maintains the occupation what you want is you want a palestinian population that submits to israeli domination of greater israel you don't want resistance you don't want an intifada you don't want what happened on october seventh in fact i think one of the principal reasons that the israelis are pounding gaza and killing huge numbers of civilians punishing the civilian population in ways that clearly violate the laws of war is because they want the palestinians to understand that they are not allowed to rise up and resist the occupation that's their goal so i think the israelis would prefer that the palestinians roll over and accept submission in terms of the people who live in gaza to include the elites and the people who live in the west bank to include the elites they would much prefer to move to some sort of situation where the palestinians have a state of their own i think in the case of the pa under abbas they would accept a two state solution i think what at this point in time hamas wants is a one state solution but they want peace all of them want peace you know the two different sets of leadership in palestine and the israelis so you think hamas wants peace sure but on its own terms that's the point what does peace look like for hamas at this point in time i think peace basically means a greater israel controlled by palestine or palestinians okay so essentially i mean it's the whole land is called palestine and there's no israel i think at this point in time that's their principal goal i do believe and there have been hints over time jimmy carter has said this that hamas can be convinced that a two state solution assuming that the the palestinians get a viable state of their own that hamas would buy into that can we say that with a high degree of certainty no but i think i think the israelis should have pursued that possibility they should have worked with abbas they should have worked with hamas to do everything they can to facilitate a two state solution because i think ultimately that's in israel's interest now the israeli government and most israelis at this point in time i believe don't agree with that what do you think of israel starting the ground invasion of gaza recently on october twenty seventh the question is should they continue until they have finally defeated hamas there are all sorts of reports in the media including in the israeli media that they're not gonna be allowed by the united states to continue this offensive from much more than a few weeks the israelis have been saying it would it's gonna take in in the best of all possible worlds a number of months if not a year to finish off hamas well it doesn't look like they're gonna have enough time to do that i doubt whether they can finish off hamas even if they're given the time i think they're gonna run into fierce resistance and when they run into fierce resistance and large numbers of israelis gonna die start to die they'll lose their appetite for this and they the israelis surely know at this point in time that even if they finish off hamas even if i'm wrong and they're able to finish off hamas another group is gonna rise up to resist the occupation the idea that you can use what ziv yabotinsky called the iron wall to beat the palestinians into submission is delusional it's just not gonna happen the palestinians want a state of their own they don't wanna live under occupation and there's no solution for israel here there has to be a political solution and the only viable political solution is a two state solution i mean you can't go to democracy you can't go to a situation where you give the palestinians equal rights inside of greater israel in large part because there are now as many palestinians as there are israeli jews and over time the balance the demographic balance shifts against the israeli jews and in favor of the palestinians in which case you'll end up with a palestinian state in greater israel so you know democracy for all doesn't work the israelis i believe are quite interested in efta cleansing i think they saw this this recent set of events as an opportunity to cleanse gaza but that's not gonna happen the jordanians and the egyptians have made it clear that that's not happening the united states has now made it clear that that's not happening and and the palestinians will not leave they'll die in place so ethnic cleansing doesn't work so you're really left with two alternatives a two state solution or a greater israel that is effectively an apartheid state i mean that's what the occupation has led to and all sorts of people have been predicting this for a long long time and you've now reached the point you know here in the united states if you say that israel is an apartheid state that's gonna get you into all sorts of trouble but the fact is that human rights watch amnesty international and b'tselem which is the leading israeli human rights group all three of those institutions or organizations have issued detailed reports making the case that israel is an apartheid state furthermore if you read the israeli media right all sorts of israelis including israeli leaders refer to israel as an apartheid state it's it's not that unusual to hear that term used in israel this is disastrous for israel in my opinion and steve walt and i said this by the way when we wrote the israel lobby that israel is an apartheid state which is equivalent to israel as an occupier is not good for israel and that brings us back to the two state solution but as you and i were talking about a few minutes ago it's hard to see how you get a two state solution and the end result of this conversation is utter despair because the path to a two state solution is blocked by the amount of hate that's created by civilian deaths well that plus the fact that the israeli government is filled with people who have no interest in a two state solution they're ideologically deeply committed to a greater israel they want all the land between the jordan river and the mediterranean sea to be part of a jewish state they're just ideologically committed to that and and of course as we're talking about before with regard to hamas hamas wants everything between the river and the sea to be a palestinian state and you know when you have two sides with those kinds of views right you're in deep trouble because there's little room for compromise so what you have to do to get this to work is you have to convince the israelis that it's in their interest to have a two state solution and you have you've already taken care of the pa on this front the palestinian authority but you've got to convince hamas that its its maximalist goals are are not gonna work and it's in its interest to follow in the footsteps of arafat and accept the two state solution but even if you do that at this point let's say that you know there's a lot of willingness intellectually on both sides to do that the problem is that the hatred that has been fueled by this recent this ongoing conflict is so great that it's just hard to imagine how you can make a two state solution work at this juncture that's why i've sort of taken to saying and i hope i'm wrong here that you know on the two state solution that that boat has sailed it's just you know it's no longer possible well again i believe in leadership and there's other parties at play here other nations jordan saudi arabia other other players in the in the middle east that can help that can help through a normalization of relationships and these kinds of things there's there's always hope like you said slither of hope slither of hope i think human civilization progresses forward by taking advantage of the all the slithers it can get let me ask you while you mentioned the israel lobby you wrote a book probably your most controversial book on the topic not probably clearly the most controversial book i ever wrote so you've criticized the israel lobby in the united states for influencing us policy in the middle east can you explain what the israel lobby is their influence and your criticism over the past let's say couple decades well the argument that steve walt and i made actually we wrote an article first and which appeared in the london review of books and then we wrote the book itself our argument is that the lobby is a loose coalition of individuals and organizations that push american policy in a pro israel direction and basically the lobby is interested in getting israel excuse me getting the united states and here we're talking mainly about the american government to support israel no matter what israel does and our argument is that if you look at the relationship between the united states and israel it's unprecedented in modern history this is the closest relationship that you can find between any two countries in recorded history it's truly amazing the extent to which israel and the united states are joined at the hip and we support israel no matter what almost all the time and our argument is that that is largely due to the influence of the lobby the lobby is an extremely powerful interest group now it's very important to understand that the american political system is set up in ways that allow interest groups of all sorts to wield great influence so in the united states you have an interest group or a lobby like the national rifle association that makes it well nigh impossible to get gun control right and so with the israel lobby you have this group of individuals and organizations that wield enormous influence on us policy toward the middle east and this is not surprising given the nature of the american political system so our argument is that the lobby is not doing anything that's illegal or illicit or immoral or unethical it's just a good old fashioned american interest group and it just happens to be extremely powerful and our argument is that this is not good for the united states because no two countries have the same interests all the time and when our interests conflict with israel's interest we should be able to do what we think is in our national interest and america's national interest but the lobby tends to conflate america's national interest with israel's national interest and wants the united states to support israel no matter what we also argue and i cannot emphasize this enough given what's going on in the world today that the lobby's effects the lobby has not been pushing policies that are in israel's interest so our argument is that the lobby right the lobby pushes policies that are not in america's interest or not in israel's interest now you're saying to yourself what exactly does he mean by that what every president since jimmy carter has tried to do as i said before is to foster a two state solution to push israel which is the dominant player in greater israel push israel to accept the two state solution and we have run into huge resistance from the lobby whenever we tried to let's be blunt about it of course israel right in a perfect world where there was no lobby and an american president was free to put pressure on israel to coerce israel i believe we would have gone a long way towards getting two state solution and i believe this would have been in israel's interest but we couldn't get a two state solution because it was almost impossible to put meaningful pressure on israel because of the lobby so this was not in israel's interest and it was not in america's interest and that was the argument that we made and we of course got huge pushback for making that argument what's the underlying motivation of the lobby is it religious in nature is it similar to the way war hawks are sort of militaristic in nature is it nationalistic in nature what what's if you were to describe this loose coalition of people what what would you say is their motivation well first of all i think you have to distinguish between jews and christians you wanna remember that there are a huge number of christian zionists who are deeply committed to israel no matter what right and then there are a large number of jews the jews are obviously the most important of those two groups in the israel lobby but you know one of the arguments that we made in the book is that you should not call it the jewish lobby because it's not populated just by jews and christian zionists are an important part of that lobby but furthermore there are a good number of jews who are opposed to the lobby and the policies that the lobby purveys and there a number of jews who are prominent anti zionist right so and they're obviously not in the lobby or or if you take a group like jewish voice for peace right jewish voice for peace is not in the lobby so it's wrong to call it a jewish lobby but with regard to the american jews who are in that lobby i i think that really this is all about nationalism it's not so much religion many of those jews who are influential in the lobby are not religious in any meaningful sense of that term but they self identify as jewish in in in the sense that they feel they're part of a jewish nation and that in addition to being an american right they are part of this tribe this nation called jews and that they have a responsibility to push the united states in ways that support the jewish state so i i think that's what drives most if not almost all the jews this is not to say there's not a religious dimension for some of them but i think that the the main connection is much more tribal in nature so i had a conversation with benjamin netanyahu and he said fundamentally if you're anti zionist you're anti semitic so the the the zionist project is tied at the hip to the jewish project what what do you have to say to that look you can define antisemitism any way you want right and you can define antisemitism to incorporate anti zionism and i think we have reached the point where antisemitism is identified today not just with anti zionism but with criticism of israel if you criticize israel people will say some people will say you're an antisemite and if that's your definition of antisemitism it's taken an important term and stretched it to the point where it's meaningless right so when steve and i wrote the book wrote the article and then wrote the book all sorts of people said that we were antisemites this is a ludicrous charge but what they meant was you're criticizing the lobby you're criticizing israel and therefore you're an antisemite okay if that's what an anti semite is somebody who criticizes israel you know probably half the jewish community if not more in the united states is anti semitic and of course you get into all these crazy games where people are calling jews self hating jews and anti semites because they're critical of israel but even people who are anti zionist i don't think they're antisemitic at all you can argue they're misguided that's fine but many of these people are jewish and proud of the fact that they're jewish they just don't believe that nationalism and jewish nationalism is a force that should be applauded and you wanna understand that in the american context there is a rich tradition of anti zionism right and these were not people who were antisemites if you go back to the thirties forties fifties and the same thing was even true in europe there were all sorts of european jews who were opposed to zionism were they anti semites i don't think so but we've gotten to the point now where people are so interested in stopping any criticism of israel that they wield this weapon of calling people antisemites so loosely that the term has kinda lost meaning so i i think netanyahu is is wrong headed to equate anti zionism with anti semitism alan dershowitz was one of the people that called you specifically anti semitic so just looking at the space of discourse how do you where's the slither of hope for healthy discourse about us relationships with israel between you and alan dershowitz and others like him well i think until there is a settlement of the israeli palestinian conflict there's just no hope of putting an end to this nonsense right so these are just uses of terms to kinda cheat your way through the through the discourse it's shortcut no it's the silence people right so it's very very important understand that one of the lobby's principal goals is to make sure we don't have an open discourse a freewheeling discourse about israel because they understand people in the lobby understand that if you have an open discourse israel will end up looking very bad right you don't wanna talk about the occupation you don't wanna talk about how israel was created right all all these subjects are ones that will cause problems for israel see just to go to the present crisis okay when you have a disaster and what happened on october seventh is a disaster one of the first things that happens is that people begin to ask the question how did this happen right what's the root cause of this problem this is a disaster we have to understand what caused it so that we can work to to make sure it doesn't happen again so we can work to shut it down and then make sure it doesn't happen again mhmm but once you start talking about the root causes right you end up talking about how israel was created right and that means telling a story that is not pretty about how the zionist conquered palestine and number two it means talking about the occupation right it's not like hamas attacked on october seventh because there were just a bunch of antisemites who hated jews and wanted to kill jews this is not you know nazi germany right this is directly related to the occupation and to what was going on inside of gaza and it's not in israel's interest or the lobby's interest to have an open discourse about what the israelis have been doing to the palestinians since i would say roughly nineteen o three when the second aliyah came to israel or came to what was then palestine right we wanna talk about that and we don't wanna talk about from the lobby's point of view the influence that the lobby has right it's better from the lobby's point of view if most americans think that american support of israel is just done for all the right moral and strategic reasons not because of the lobby and when john mearsheimer and steve walt come along and say you have to understand that this special relationship is due in large part to the lobby's influence that is not an argument that people in the lobby wanna hear so the point is you have to go to great lengths for all these reasons you have to go to great lengths to silence people like me and steve walt and one of the ways to do that is to call us antisemites i think the chapter or the section of the book where we talk about this charge of antisemitism is called the great silencer that's what we call the charge of antisemitism the great silencer who wants to be called an antisemite especially in the wake of the holocaust do i wanna be called an anti semite oh my god no and so it's very effective but you know it is important to talk about these issues in my humble opinion and i think if we had talked about these issues way back when it would have gone a long way towards you know maybe getting a two state solution which i think was the best alternative here it it's complicated and i wonder if you can comment on the complexity of this because criticizing israel and you know criticizing the lobby can for a lot of people be a dog whistle for sort of anti semitic conspiracy theories that you know this idea that jews run everything run the world they're in this kinda cabal and you know it's it's also very true that people who are legitimately antisemitic are also critics of israel in the same kind of way and so it's such a complicated landscape in which to have discussions because you know even people like david duke who are you know racist don't sound racist on the surface i haven't listened to him enough but like you know there's dog whistles it's it's a complicated space in which to have discussions because it i mean i wonder if you can sort of speak to that because there's this silencing effect of calling everybody antisemitic but it's also true that there is antisemitism in the world like there is the size of a population of people that hate jews there's probably a size of a population of people who hate muslims too but you know i a lot of hate out there a lot of hate out there but the hatred of jews has like a long history and so you have like you know rolling stones have a a set of great hits and there's just a set of great hits of the ways conspiracy theories that you can make up about the jews that are used as part of the hatred so there's like nice templates for that and i i just wonder if you can comment on operating as a historian as an analyst as a strategic thinker in this kind of space yeah we obviously when we wrote the article which we did before the book gave this subject a great deal of thought i mean what you say just now is music to our ears i'm talking for me and about me and steve i mean i think that you know your point about dog whistles is correct look we went to great lengths to make it clear that this is not a cabal it's not a conspiracy and in fact in a very important way the lobby operates out in the open right they brag about their power right and this was true before we wrote the article right and and we said in the article and the book and you heard me say it here first of all it's not a jewish lobby right secondly it's not a cabal right it's an american interest group and and the american system is designed such that interest groups are perfectly legal and some of them are super effective exact i mean you yeah hit the nail right on the head that's exactly right and you know and there was nothing that we said that was anti semitic by any reasonable definition of that term and you know huge numbers of jews have known me and steve over the years and nobody ever ever said that we were anti semitic before march two thousand six when the article appeared because we're not anti semitic but look you've got this interest group right that has a significant influence on american policy and on israeli policy and you wanna talk about it it's just important to talk about it it's important for jews right in the united states for jews in israel to talk about this the idea that you you wanna silence critics is not a smart way to go about doing business in my opinion if we were wrong if steve and i were so wrong and our arguments were so foul they could have easily exposed those arguments they could have gone into combat with this in terms of the marketplace of ideas and easily knocked us down the problem was that our arguments were quite powerful and instead of engaging us and defeating our arguments they wanted to silence us and this is not good right it's not good for israel it's not good for the united states and i would argue in the end if anything it's gonna foster antisemitism i think you don't wanna run around telling people that they can't talk about israel without being called an antisemite it's just not it's not healthy in terms of the issue that you're raising right but i still agree with you that it is tricky issue it's i i don't wanna make light of that you know i know that there's this piece of literature out there called the protocols of the elders of zion and i fully understand that if you're not careful you can come close to writing volume two of the protocol but i don't believe that we wrote anything that was even close to that and again i think that a healthy debate on the issues that we were raising would have been in not only in america's interest but it would have been in israel's interest yeah i mean underneath it all is just i wonder why there is so much hate against groups why it's such a sticky way of thinking not just tribalism like proud of your country and kinda hating another country but really deeply hating like hating in a way where it's part of your identity kind of hate well just to make a general point on this issue in our conversation here today you often talk about individual leaders and the word individual often pops up in your vocabulary yes i believe that we are ultimately social animals before we are individuals i believe we're born into tribes we're heavily socialized and that we carve out space for our individualism but we are part of tribes and or social groups or nations call them what you want ethnic groups religious groups but the fact is that these tribes often crash into each other and when they crash into each other they end up hating each other if you go to a place like bosnia right the croats and the serbs oh my god and then throw in the bosniaks or which is the term for bosnian muslims and you know muslims croats serbs oh and the tribes you know hate each other and in in a funny way that hatred almost never goes away and i guess there are some exceptions to that if you look at the germans after world war two they've gone a long way towards reducing i wouldn't wanna say completely eliminating but reducing a lot of the hatred that existed between germans and their neighbors but that's really kind of an anomalous case i mean you go around east asia today and the hatred of japan in a place like china the hatred of japan in a place like korea just not to be underestimated and so but i think a lot of it just has to do with the fact that you're dealing with social groups that have crashed into each other at one point or another and there are those lingering effects and by the way this gets back to our discussion a few minutes ago about trying to get a two state solution between the palestinians and the israeli jews now that you have had this horrible war which is ongoing it's interesting to ask to go back to world war two now you said you studied nazi germany in the in the thirties from a perspective of maybe offensive realism but just to look at the holocaust it's sometimes popular in public discourse today to compare certain things to the holocaust people have compared the hamas attack on israel to the holocaust saying things like it's the the the biggest attack on jews since the holocaust which kind of implies that there's a comparison people have made that same comparison in the other direction what do you make of this comparison is it comparable is it is the use of the holocaust have any accuracy in comparison to modern day international politics is it possible that you could have another genocide yes and i would argue that what you had in rwanda was a genocide right the holocaust is not the only genocide i believe the word genocide is used too loosely today and as you know lots of people and i mean lots of people who are pro palestinian accused the israelis of engaging in genocide in gaza i think what the israelis are doing in gaza represents a massacre i would use that term given the number of civilians that they've killed and the fact that they've been indiscriminate in terms of how they've been bombing gaza but i would not use the word genocide for me a genocide is where one side attempts to eliminate another group from the planet i think that what happened with the holocaust was clearly a genocide and that the germans were bent on destroying all of european jewry and if they could have gotten their hands on jews outside of europe they would have murdered them as well that's a genocide and i think with the hutus and the tutsis you had a similar situation i think with the turks and the armenians during world war one that was a genocide but i have a rather narrow definition of what a genocide is and i don't think there are many cases that qualify as a genocide the holocaust certainly does okay now what hamas did doesn't even come close to what happened to european jewry between let's say nineteen thirty nine and nineteen forty five although i date the start of the holocaust to nineteen forty one if we were you know looking at it closely but let's just say nineteen thirty nine when they invade poland from nineteen thirty nine to nineteen forty five what must it pales in comparison it's hard to believe anybody would make that argument right yes a lot of jews died but hardly hardly any compared to the number that died you know at the hands of the germans i mean it's just no parallel at all and furthermore hamas was in no position to kill all of the jews in the middle east just not not gonna happen yeah but there's also levels of things you know using germans using human skin for lamps there's just levels of evil in this world yes but you don't see that with i mean that's not what hamas is doing i mean i i i wanna be very clear here i am not justifying the kill hamas' killing of civilians okay not for one second but i'm just saying and and and by the way just to go to the israelis and what they're doing in gaza right as i said to you before i do believe that is a massacre and i believe that's to be condemned the killing of civilians this is not legitimate collateral damage they're directly punishing the population but i would not call that a genocide right and i would not compare that to the holocaust for for for one second i just wanna be very clear on that do you think if israel could they would avoid the death of any civilians so you're saying there's some degree of punishment of collective anger purposely killing civilians it's this is the iron wall they're trying to beat the palestinians into submission right there's no way you kill this many civilians if you're trying to precisely take out hamas fighters and by the way the israeli spokesman the idf spokesman has explicitly said that we are not pursuing precision bombing and that what we are doing is trying to you know maximize the amount of destruction and damage that we can inflict on the palestinians and i i i think this is a major mistake on the part of israel first of all it ends up being a moral stain on your reputation number one and number two it doesn't work it doesn't work the the palestinians are not gonna roll over and submit to israeli domination of their life so you know the whole concept of the iron wall gabatinsky's term was misguided and and and by the way the iron if you look at what the israelis are doing they're trying to do two things one is the iron wall and that's where you punish the civilian population in gaza and get them to submit the other thing that they're trying to do is get hamas they wanna destroy hamas and the belief there is that if they destroy hamas they've solved the problem but as many israelis know including people on the hard right even if you destroy hamas they are going to be replaced by another group another resistance group and that resistance group will employ terror yeah i think you i think you've said that other terrorist organizations have used the situation in palestine as a as a kind of a recruit recruitment mechanism for for a long time osama bin laden made it clear that this was one of those principal reasons for attacking the united states right and the united states attacked back and got us into a twenty year war that cost the lives of millions of people not not americans but human beings yeah and you know in torture torture yeah no i think if you look at how we reacted to nine eleven and how the israelis are reacting to what happened on october seventh there's quite a bit of similarity in that both sides the israeli side and the american side are enraged right and they lash out and they go on a rampage and the end result is not good is there a capacity within israel or within united states after nine eleven to do something approximating turn the other cheek of understanding the root of terror is hate and fighting that hate with not to sound naive but compassion well i i don't think in either case you're gonna turn the other cheek i think the well some i what i mean by that is some limited powerful military response but very limited yeah coupled with a smart political strategy political strategy diplomacy yeah that's what they should have done yeah right but is there capacity for that or from your offensive realism perspective it's just the odds are really low from my offensive realist perspective or my realist perspective that's what you should do right you you my my view is states are rational actors they should be cunning right they should think about the strategic situation they're in and choose the appropriate response and what happens and this is why my theory is not always correct is that sometimes states are not rational and they misbehave i would argue in the israeli case that it would have been good after october seventh or starting on october seventh if the united states had tried to hold the israelis back and countenance a more moderate response a more to to to spend take some time just to think about how to deal with this problem instead of lashing out i i think given what happened to the israelis given how shocked they were given the level of fear given the level of rage they were gonna lash out and i don't believe that was in their interest i think it would have been made would have made sense to to think about it and to think about a smarter strategy than they're now employing and i think you know the americans blew it the americans gave them a bear hug and a green light and said we'll give you all the weaponry you need and go out and do it and i don't think that was the smart thing to do look in the wake of october seventh the israelis had no good strategy right it's it's not like there's a magic formula they just didn't see and we should have told them what the magic formula was right that's not true they were in a sense caught between iraq and a hard place in terms of what to do but there's smarter things and dumber things and i think the israelis lashed out in ways that are counterproductive i think you know going on a rampage and you know killing huge numbers of civilians is not it's obviously morally wrong but it's also just not in their strategic interest right i mean because it's it's not gonna buy them anything right and in fact it's gonna cost them right because people all over the planet are turning against israel i saw you know an israeli think tank today that has been tracking protests around the world gave some figures for what it looked like between october seventh and october thirteenth in terms of the number of protests around the world that were pro israel versus pro palestine and then it looked at the numbers from october thirteenth up to the present and i think the numbers were sixty nine percent were pro palestinian in the first six days after october seventh sixty nine percent and i think thirty one percent take these numbers with a grain of salt thirty one percent were pro israel so i think it was sixty nine and thirty one and since then since october thirteenth if you look at the number of protests around the world ninety five percent have been pro palestinian and five percent have been pro israel and what this tells you is that public opinion around the world has shifted against israel and if you look at some of the demonstrations in places like london and washington dc it's truly amazing the number of people who are coming out in support of the palestinians and all of this again is just to support my point that it was just not smart for israel to launch this bombing campaign right you can make an argument for going after hamas and doing it in a surgical way or as surgical way as possible but that's not what they did and again my point to you is i think that this punishment campaign is not gonna work strategically in other words they're not gonna beat the palestinians into submission they're not gonna finish off hamas and at the same time by pursuing this strategy they're doing huge damage to their reputation around the world well i just yeah in the wake of october seventh given the geopolitical context i think there's a lot of leverage to be the great ethical superpower that that demonstrate power without killing any civilians and use that leverage diplomatic leverage to push forward something like a abrahamic accords with more nations with with saudi arabia push for peace aggressively peace agreements this kind of stuff economic relationships all of this kind of stuff and thereby pressure the palestinian authority you know towards perhaps a two state solution but i think what you're missing here just in the israeli case is that the israeli government is not interested in two state solution and you wanna remember that benjamin netanyahu who looks very hawkish when you look at him in isolation doesn't look so hawkish when you look at him compared to the rest of the people in his cabinet right he he he almost looks like a moderate he's got a lot of people who are way out to the right of him and these people and this of course includes netanyahu are not interested in a two state solution so the question you have to ask yourself is you if you're if you're benjamin netanyahu and it's july seventh late in the excuse me october seventh late in the day what do you do you're not thinking about a two state solution you're thinking about an occupation that's not gonna end and the question is how do you deal with the palestinians given what's just happened well there's people in the cabinet and then there's history and history remembers great leaders and so benjamin netanyahu can look in the streets of israel and see the protests and think of how history will remember him and i think a two state solution is on the table for a great leader well it was there was he the person who was gonna take advantage of it i don't think so but well he's a student of history well at this point what we'll see i mean it's very at this point it's very difficult like you said ninety five percent now or whatever the number is of protests i think the the window in which israel has the ears of the world they can do the the big ethical peace act action towards peace is i think is closed or maybe they're still slow there but it's just the slippery slope of of hate is has taken off yeah it's it's quite depressing to watch yep what's going on i agree a hundred percent unequivocally depressing but you know of course as you talk about the the role of you the the us involvement is of critical importance here for the united states and the argument you make is that we should not be involved in ukraine at least to the degree we are we being the united states and we should not be involved in israel to the degree we are because it's stretching us too thin when the big geopolitical contender in the twenty first century with the united states is china that is that a correct summary yeah i i think just on ukraine we should not have pushed ukraine to join nato sure and once the war started we should have worked overtime to shut it down immediately march yeah march right and and you remember by the way not to go back to ukraine in great detail in the fall early fall of twenty twenty two the war starts february twenty twenty two there's march twenty twenty two which we've talked about which is the negotiations in the fall of twenty twenty two i think it was in september the ukrainians had won two major tactical victories one in kherson and the other in kharkiv mhmm and at that point in time general milley who was the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said now is the time to negotiate because this is the high watermark for the ukrainians yeah milley understood that things were only gonna get worse and the white house shut billy down and said we're not negotiating so we have blown a number of opportunities here to head this problem off at the pass and but that's my view there and with regard to the israelis my only point about israel is that it would be better for israel and better for the united states if we the united states were in was in a position the united states was in a position to put pressure on israel from time to time as steve and i say in the book we should be able to treat israel like a normal country right the fact is that countries sometimes do stupid things this includes the united states and israel and if israel is pursuing a policy that we think is unwise we should be in a position where we could put pressure on israel yeah that's our argument right but anyway we goofed both with regard to ukraine and with regard to the middle east and we're now up to our eyeballs in alligators in both of those regions and as you describe my view this is not good because the area of the most strategic importance for the united states today is east asia and that's because china is there and china is the most serious threat the united states faces do you think there will be a war with china in the twenty first century i don't know my argument is there will be there is right now a serious security competition and at the same time there is a real possibility of war whether or not we avoid it is very hard to say i mean we did during the cold war we had a serious security competition from roughly nineteen forty seven to nineteen eighty nine and and we thankfully avoided war probably came the closest in nineteen sixty two with the cuban missile crisis but we avoided it and i think we can avoid it here is it for sure no you've said that china won't move on taiwan militarily in part because it's as you said amphibious operations are difficult why will china not move on taiwan is in your sense in the near future well it's because there's this body of water called the taiwan strait mhmm which is a big body of water and getting across water is very difficult unless you can walk on water so geography still has a role to play in the twenty first century oh yeah i think geography is very important big bodies of water really matter yeah in an ideal world you'd like to have the pacific ocean between you and any potential adversary you know six thousand miles yes six thousand miles of water hard to get across yes if you're a country and i'm a country and there's land between us i can take my panzer divisions and i can go right across the land and get into your country or attack your country and you of course can take your panzer divisions and come across that same piece of land but if there's a big body of water between us your panzer divisions can't go across the water and then the question is how do you get them across the water and that's very tricky and in a world where you have lots of submarines and you have lots of aircraft and you have missiles that are land based that can hit those surface ships it is very very hard to you know to attack across a body of water and all you have to do is think about normandy you know the american invasion in normandy june six nineteen forty four mhmm coming in on omaha beach right oh boy that is really difficult but there is a growing asymmetry of military power there that even though it's difficult that is correct so i i guess that is correct so i i i was just gonna had a conversation with with elon musk and and he says that you know china is quite serious about the one china policy and it seems inevitable that taiwan will have to be if you look at this pragmatically in the twenty first century it seems inevitable that taiwan will have to be a part of china and so we can get there either diplomatically or militarily what do you think about the inevitability of that kind of idea when a nation says this is a top priority for us what do you think about them meaning it and what do we do about that there's no question it's a top priority for them and there's no question they mean it but it's also a top priority for us not to let them take taiwan why exactly because it's an important strategic asset many people will say it's because taiwan's a democracy but that doesn't matter that much it's because of two strategic reasons the first is that if we were to let taiwan go it would have hugely negative consequences for our alliance structure in east asia mhmm to contain china we need allies we have alliance structure and our allies japanese south koreans filipinos australians they're all counting on us to be there for them and if we say we're not gonna defend taiwan the chinese attack they're gonna say i bet if the chinese attack us the americans won't be there for us so the it it would have a damaging effect on our alliance structure which we cannot afford because because containing china is a wicked problem it's a powerful state and you're getting to this before when you talked about china versus taiwan so that's the first reason second reason is you wanna bottle up the chinese navy in the chinese air force inside the first island chain you don't wanna let them get out into the pacific you don't want them dominating the waters of east asia you wanna bottle them up again inside the first island chain and you can only do that if you control taiwan you don't control taiwan they get out into the philippine sea into the pacific and the western pacific and cause all sorts of problems well you saying all that you've also said the century of humiliation japan and the united states are a source of that humiliation for china don't you think they see the other side of that absolutely and in the interest of avoiding a world war i guess the question is how do we avoid a world war it doesn't seem like the military involve involvement in the conflict between china and taiwan is the way well i i don't want there's there's no good answers here i'm just saying there are no good which is the the less bad option well what you wanna do is you wanna make sure that you deter china from invading taiwan you want to avoid a war you and i are in complete agreement on that we don't want a war but we wanna contain china we do not wanna let china dominate asia that that's what the americans are principally concerned with here and it's with china's neighbors are principally concerned with this includes the japanese the south koreans filipinos australians and the taiwanese we they don't want and we don't want china to dominate the region so we have to contain it but at the same time and this should be music to your ears we not only wanna contain it we wanna make sure we don't end up in a shooting match with the chinese because this could be disastrous so you have to have a very smart policy you have to build powerful military forces and you have to make sure you don't do anything that's provocative on taiwan for example the last thing you want is for the taiwanese government to declare its independence because the chinese have said if taiwan does that we'll go to war and of course we don't want that so my view is you wanna smartly build up your military forces and you wanna do everything you can to contain china and at the same time not be provocative so a big component of that is making sure your military the us military is bigger than the chinese military not necessarily it's an interesting question a lot of people think that to make deterrence work right you have to be able to beat the chinese and therefore you need a much bigger military and i don't think over time that's possible right i think it's probably not even possible now to beat the chinese in a war over taiwan or in a war in the south china sea i think what you wanna do is make it clear to the chinese either that there will be no winner in other words you don't have to win but you wanna make sure they don't win okay it's it's it's a lose lose proposition if they go to war over taiwan or what have you and if you can't do that right you think that they're so powerful that they're ultimately gonna win you wanna convince them that victory would be a pyrrhic victory in other words they would pay a god awful price to win the war you follow what i'm saying so excuse me the best strategy for deterrence is you win mhmm china loses second best strategy is a stalemate nobody wins third best strategy is they win but they pay a god awful price and the fourth possibility which you don't want is they win quickly and decisively right if that's the case then you don't have much deterrence what does a world with china as the sole dominant superpower look like i mean a little bit underlying our discussion is this kind of idea that us is the good guys and china is the bad guys first of all you know the the you know dividing the world to good guys and bad guys seems to somehow miss the nuance of this whole human civilization project we're undertaking but what does the world look like where china is the dominant sole superpower in a unipolar world well i i don't tend to think of the world in terms of good guys and bad guys as a good realist i i think that you know states are states mhmm they're all black boxes you know i don't discriminate between democracies and autocracies mhmm but having said that i am an american right and as an american i'm interested in the security of my country the survival of my country so i want the united states to be the most powerful state in the world which means i want the dot united states to dominate the western hemisphere i want us to be a regional hegemon and i wanna make sure that china does not dominate asia the way we dominate the western hemisphere it's not because i think we're the good guys and they're the bad guys if i were chinese and i were in beijing and i were xi jinping's national security adviser i'd tell him what we gotta do is make sure we dominate the world or dominate our region and then do everything we can to to undermine america's position in the western hemisphere right that that be my view so i guess you could say i do view the world in terms of good guys and bad guys because i'm an american and i'm more like us and them versus yeah it's us and them that's that's a nice way to put it yeah it's us versus them not so much good guys versus bad guys is it possible to have a stable peaceful world with a good balance of power with the where it's china and us as superpowers you know it's a bipolar world no longer unipolar yeah okay so you're hypothesizing a world where they dominate asia yeah and we dominate the western hemisphere yep i i believe there would be a great deal of security competition intense security competition between those two superpowers definition of intense matters here so it could be small small military conflicts or it could be extremely large unstable military conflicts right well conflict let's use the word war okay so i i distinguish between security competition and war and what i'm telling you is you'll have an intense security competition where there's no shooting or if there's shooting it's mainly proxies that are doing the fighting got it much like the vietnam war right or you could have a case where one of those superpowers was involved in a war against a proxy of the other superpower mhmm korean war think the korean war mhmm the united states fought the chinese who were allied with the soviets at the time mhmm but a war between the united states and china just like a war between the united states and the soviet union during the cold war that's what you really want to avoid avoid so i think you'd have an intense security competition right you'd have wars involving proxies of each of those two superpowers and you would probably have some wars where one of the superpowers was involved in a proxy right with the other super one of the super other superpowers proxies so it seems likely then if that's the case then it would be taiwan as the proxy united states but you wanna remember you're hypothesizing a situation where china dominates asia oh already has dominated yes already dominated taiwan i see we we well where do you find the proxies well australia the middle east could be a a good case oh wow right persian gulf oh boy and then our discussion of israel becomes even more dramatically yeah well israel israel gets involved i think i think in this scenario if you're talking about a us china competition right and you're talking about the middle east i think it's the gulf it's it's the saudis the iranians the iraqis it's the oil don't you think it could be israel versus iran with some very nineteen eighty four kind of dramatic partnership of iran russia and china versus united states europe and israel i think that's possible yeah i i think that's possible yeah now that i i mean i hadn't thought about it until you said it but yeah i think that that that is possible isn't isn't that terrifying yeah well that you know in your scenario where china already dominates asia and we dominate the western hemisphere i think you start talking about where the most likely places that the united states and china go head to head or or fight through proxies i i think it is the goal for the middle east and the scenario that you posit i mean one one question i have i don't know about you but for me unlike with the soviet union and i know i was born there but even outside of that the cultural gap the the the loss in translation the communication gap between china and the united states seems to be much greater than that of what was the former soviet union and the united states i see two cultures intermingling and communicating as one of the ways to deescalate future conflict it's a interesting question i mean it it is sort of an abstract theoretical level my argument is that great powers act according to realist dictates mhmm and they understand those realist dictates and that could lead to cooperation or it can lead to war it depends i would say just in the case of the soviets a lot of people describe the cold war as an ideological competition above all else it's was communism versus liberal democracy or communism versus liberal capitalism whatever i actually don't believe that i i believe the soviets were realist to the core i believe stalin was a realist par excellence and that ideology did not matter much in stalin's foreign policy and i believe if you look at soviet foreign policy after world war two you know throughout the cold war they were realist to the core and and i think in those days the americans were realist right a lot of liberal ideology floating around out there but the americans were realists and i think one of the reasons you avoided a shooting match between the united states and the soviet union from forty seven to eighty nine was because both sides i think understood basic balance of power logic us china competition is somewhat different first of all the chinese are realist to the core i i've spent a lot of time in china i basically have rock and roll i'm basically a rock and roll star in china the chinese you're kind of a big deal in china i love it the chinese are my kind of people yeah they're realists right they speak my language yeah it's the united states that is not very realist yeah american leaders have a very powerful liberal bent and tend not to see the world in realist terms i believe by the way just going back to our discussion of nato expansion i think our inability to understand that nato expansion was anathema to the soviet to the russians was doing large parts of the fact that we just during the unipolar moment didn't think of international politics from a realist perspective mhmm and didn't respect anyone who thought about international politics from a realist perspective if those various american administrations starting with the clinton administration had put their realist hat on they would have understood that nato expansion into ukraine was not a good idea but we had this thoroughly liberal view of the world that dominated our thinking and it's gone away somewhat since we've moved into multipolarity but not completely and this makes me a little nervous right to pick up on your point i mean united states is thinking about the world in ways that are somewhat different than the chinese who realist par excellence so that's fascinating so the chinese are pragmatic about thinking of the world and as a competition of military powers all the ways in which you describe the realist perspective so that that mean that's a that's a that's a hopeful thing right if we can achieve stability and a balance of powers through that military competition yeah i i actually think that's right i think if the united states just let me talk a little bit about the united states to get at the issue you're raising if the united states pursues a smart containment strategy mhmm given what you just said and i said about the chinese i think we will avoid war the problem with the americans is it's not just the liberalism it's the possibility that we will pursue a rollback policy mhmm in other words during the cold war we pursued containment it was whenever anybody talked about american grand strategy towards the soviet union's containment containment containment we now know from the historical record that the united states was not only pursuing containment it was pursuing rollback we were trying to rollback soviet power mhmm to put it bluntly we were trying to wreck the soviet union okay and i would not be surprised moving forward with regard to china if the united states pursues a serious rollback policy and so you're saying throughout history united states was always doing that always well where's that from why why can't we respect the power of other nations because they may be a threat to us we well i mean you you you don't look you don't respect the power of other nations you fear the power of other nations well fear and respect the next door neighbors depending on the neighborhood you're living in but i i just mean it's it could be very counterproductive to try because if you can empathize with their if if you assume they're rational actors you try and roll back will create would lean into the uncertainty of potential conflicts you wanna avoid the uncertainty of potential conflict caution right well yes and no look your point is you wanna empathize you wanna be able to put yourself in the shoes of the other side yes i agree one hundred percent but with that right it's very important if you're a first class strategist to be able to do that but at the same time there is this competition for power taking place and what you wanna do is maximize how much power you have relative to the other side and the other side wants to maximize how much power it has relative to you so you have this competition for power right that's taking place all the time and that's taking place at the same time you wanna have empathy or you wanna be able to put yourself in the shoes of the other side so those two things kinda go together right it just feels less threatening to build up your thing versus try to hurt the other person's thing the other group's thing right but if you build up your own power you are building up your capability to hurt the other side right but like you do i guess you don't rattle the saber just just work on manufacturing sabers well that i agree with i i think that you know the united states you know wants to make sure it has a big stick in east asia for purposes of containing china and avoiding a war right again i wanna be clear i'm not advocating that we start world war three mhmm but the point is you wanna have a big stick and you wanna make sure that you don't overstep your bounds in terms of using that big stick this is the danger with rollback right that you get too aggressive and you precipitate a war right and you also just have to be very careful what you say and to go back to your favorite argument you wanna be able to have empathy or put yourself in the shoes of the other side because if you do something you wanna think smartly about what that other side how that other side is gonna see your action and how they're gonna react mhmm right and and mostly focus on the carrots have a giant stick laying around but never mention it just focus on the carrots well occasionally you have to mention the stick right everyone knows the stick is there there is some truth in that right i mean yeah but you know the and words matter a lot it it feels you know this our current president biden is meeting with xi jinping and i think the words exchanged there are are really important i have a notion that leaders can stop wars just as much as they can start wars well leaders matter there's no question about that no question but just on on rhetoric you wanna remember that putin has on more than one occasion very subtly rattled the nuclear sword oh yeah and it has been very effective yeah because joe biden has paid attention and joe biden wants to make sure we don't end up in a thermonuclear war and thank goodness he's thinking that way so all putin has to do is mention the possibility of nuclear war just to go back to taiwan you know i switch areas of the world if you're interested in containing china and you're interested in deterrence and let's go back to those various scenarios where the chinese win we win chinese win but they do it at a costly at great cost one could argue that that discussion that i laid out before didn't take into account nuclear weapons mhmm and all president biden or any of his successors has to do is just very subtly rattle mhmm or or or or employ the nuclear threat you know and just sort of remind the chinese that you know you start a war over taiwan it could easily escalate into a nuclear war you wanna understand we both have nuclear weapons and if either one of us is put into a desperate situation we may turn to those nuclear weapons and oh by the way xi jinping you wanna understand that we're out here in the water and using nuclear weapons in the water it's not that it's not the same as using war nuclear weapons on land so we may very well use them i'm not saying we will but anyway a little saber rattling yeah right let me just zoom out on human history what makes empires collapse and what makes them last when they do when you look at human history in your sense thinking about the united states perhaps as an empire i don't view the united states as an empire what's the what's the definite so to you empire is a thing that seeks expansion possibly yeah i i think it's a country that incorporates different regions or areas around the world into sort of a giant sphere of influence without incorporating those territories actually into the state itself so you had this thing called the british empire and it controlled areas like india north america and kenya just to pick a couple instances at different points singapore would be another example australia would be another example so these were all entities that were part of the british empire right and the united states has taken a stab at empire after the spanish american war for example with regard to the philippines and cuba and puerto rico but we never got serious about it there there's never been an american empire this is not to say the united states is not an incredibly powerful country that goes all around the world building military bases and stationing troops here there and everywhere but we're not running an empire the way the british empire was run or the french empire so the question for me is why did those empires go away the why did the british empire go away if you ever look at a map of the world in nineteen twenty two after world war one it's truly amazing how much of that map is controlled by britain mhmm right they had a huge empire and it disappeared probably by far the biggest in terms of area empire in human history i think so i think that's right it almost has to be yeah right right it's crazy crazy yeah it's true and then no longer no longer is the case yeah now i i wanna be clear the the americans have wielded maybe even greater influence than britain did when it had its empire but i don't believe we have an empire that bears any resemblance to the british empire so the question is what happened to that british empire what happened to the french empire what happened to the belgian empire what happened to the dutch empire these were countries that had colonies all over the planet the dutch east indies right vietnam was you know french indochina where where did those empires go two factors finish them off number one nationalism nationalism became a very powerful force in the nineteenth century it began to rear its head in the late eighteenth century and became a very powerful force in the nineteenth and certainly in the twentieth can you explain nationalism here nationalism is the idea that these different nations that were part of the empire like the kenyans wanted their own state nation state mhmm this is my point about the palestinians right this is palestinian nationalism what is zionism zionism is jewish nationalism jewish nationalism think of theodore herzl's famous book it's called the jewish state nation state think of the word nation state that embodies nationalism nation state jewish state palestinians want their own state two state solution right can't beat the palestinians into submission right the indians wanted their own state the pakistanis wanted their own state the kenyans wanted their own state singapore wanted its own state oh the americans wanted their own state this is called the american revolution yep right so that's the first reason nationalism that these empires disappeared the second reason is that from a cost benefit analysis they no longer made any sense and it was the coming of the industrial revolution once the industrial revolution comes an empire is basically an albatross around your neck i would argue that the british empire was an albatross around britain's neck in most of the twentieth century some of my friends disagree with that and think there were all sorts of benefits from the british empire but you wanna remember that in the twentieth century the three countries that really were powerful were the united states germany and the soviet union those were the big three did any of them have an empire no that's a good card aren't you in the industrial world yes you don't need you know an empire right what you need is a powerful manufacturing base well the the cost benefit analysis is different before the industrial revolution there's been many empires there's no question that empires came and went right i mean yes right and or or you have to do is just look at the british and the french in the seven years war seventeen fifty six to seventeen sixty three the british win they get canada right and that's why you know quebec montreal all these big french speaking areas are now part of canada right so borders change and you know countries got established the united states being one and remember south america and central america were once completely dominated by the spanish and in the case of brazil the portuguese but they all in the nineteenth century got their independence right and what i'm saying to you is in the nineteenth and in the twentieth century there were two forces that were really driving the train one is nationalism and then the other is the industrial revolution which changes the cost benefit analysis almost too crazy of a question but if you look let me calculate let's say five hundred years from now and you you you you john muir sharma somehow traveled through time and are at a bookstore looking at the entire history of human civilization in a single book what role does us play like what's the story of us over the next hundred two hundred three hundred years is it a big role small role well that's a long time if you you ask me let's just say the next hundred years yeah that's k i think that's still tough that's still tough but actually you know i think we're in excellent shape and here's the reason going back to the beginning of our conversation you asked me you know about power and i told you the two principle building blocks of power mhmm are population size and wealth okay and therefore you wanna look around the world and you wanna look at what you think the demographics are of countries like britain the united states iran china russia pick your country moving forward right what are the demographics look like and how wealthy of those are those countries likely to be what you discover very quickly is that almost every country around the world is depopulating over time right russia's gonna be much smaller china's gonna be much smaller a hundred years from now than both of those countries are as best we can tell united states american women are not having lots of babies these days mhmm no question about that but we have immigration we're an immigrant culture you're a perfect manifestation of that you're perfect you're now an american that's wonderful we need more people like you right mhmm so when i hear donald trump and others arguing that immigration's a terrible thing this is ridiculous that's fascinating immigration is what made us great right it's when my relatives came over in the middle of the nineteenth century from germany and ireland right that's fascinating like the you know because there's you know there's been a huge concern that america and other developed nations are not having enough children but you you just made me realize in the long arc of history the united states has gotten really damn good at integrating immigrants and you and like helping them flourish the whole diversity of the you're absolutely right there's a machinery of integrating other cultures yeah just very quickly on this as as it sam huntington's book who are we yeah which in many ways i i love that book but it has one fundamental flaw and a number of people told him beforehand that that flaw existed and he didn't fix it but sam argues in the book that we have large numbers of hispanics in this country and we're doing a very poor job of integrating them into the mainstream and they're not becoming americans and because many of them are concentrated in the southwest of the united states unlike other ethnic groups that were spread out all over god's little green acre right we're gonna have this cohesive group of spanish speaking americans right who were gonna want to break away and the united states is no longer gonna be you know a reasonably coherent nation state he's wrong the all the evidence is that hispanics are integrating into the american mainstream more quickly and more effectively than the european em economic the european immigrant groups that came starting around eighteen thirty five if you look at immigration from europe into the united states leaving aside the original wasps who came over and founded the place the immigrants start coming in large numbers in eighteen thirty five and we really don't shut the door until nineteen twenty four mhmm right starting this is a crude overview starting in eighteen thirty five and running up till about eighteen eighty five it's mainly germans and irish that's why germans are the largest ethnic group to ever come to the united states and the irish are right behind them these are the european ethnic groups we're talking about then starting in eighteen eighty five poles jews and italians start coming right and the germans and irish keep coming and this is why ellis island is opened i think it's eighteen ninety three ellis island is open because castle garden in new york which had handled all the previous immigrants coming across the pond castle garden couldn't handle them all so they opened up ellis island that's why somebody like me i can't find my distant relatives' records in ellis island because they came through castle garden mhmm right whereas lots of jews i know lots of italians i know they could find their relatives' records the gates it's the only time we've ever really shut the gates in a meaningful way right and this is what made america great mhmm right all these people and they made lots of babies right so in some sense make america great again means getting in getting more immigrants in well we opened the gates again in sixty five mhmm closed them in twenty four opened them in sixty five i'm oversimplifying the story here because we didn't completely shut them we almost completely shut them in twenty four opened in sixty five and we've had huge numbers of immigrants flowing in these immigrants who have been flowing in since sixty five are not europeans they're not mainly europeans they're mainly hispanics and asians if you look at those hispanics and asians they're integrating into the american mainstream at a much faster and more effective clip than was the case with those immigrants who come came in in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century mhmm the irish oh my god you know they were treated horribly there's a book a very famous book that's been written called when the irish became white just think about the title of that book yeah there was discrimination against all these groups mhmm right and the worst discrimination of course was against chinese americans right but we've gotten much better and what we should do moving forward is redouble our efforts to integrate immigrants into the american mainstream you know hispanics you know asians of all sorts because the fact is that america is rapidly reaching the point where it's not gonna be an all white country right i have five children and two of my children are i was a generation z gen z mhmm gen z is the last majority white generation mhmm right subsequent generations are not majority white so for anybody who's bothered by this i'm not bothered by that but for anybody who is bothered by this they better get used to it mhmm because americans aren't making enough babies that we can continue to grow population wise in a robust way so we need immigration and we're an immigrant culture and this is a great virtue it has been a great virtue over time it should be a source of hope not worry that's my view that's my view and america when it works is a place that is very attractive to immigrants mhmm and immigrants can do very well here and and then the real key moving forward is intermarriage right mhmm and you have a huge amount of intermarriage mhmm right somebody was telling me not too long ago that the highest intermarriage rates in the united states are among asian women asian american women asian women and anglos right and i say wonderful and great yeah no the more love is the fastest way to integrate yeah well you don't you what you wanna do is you wanna eliminate difference yes right you you wanna eliminate difference right it's like you know people who say i'm an anti semite right i have two grandsons who adolf hitler would have thrown into a gas chamber one of whose first name is john and middle name is mearsheimer right yeah this is what you want yeah right steve walt's wife and his two children would have been thrown into a gas chamber by adolf hitler yeah right this is what you want you want intermarriage now there are good number of people in some of those groups especially among jews who don't like intermarriage right yeah but they've lost because i haven't looked recently at the data the data among for intermarriage rates among basically secular jews but it used to be around sixty two percent mhmm large numbers of jews marry goyim and they've lost because of intermarriage intermarriage helps fight tribalism destructive kind of tribalism exactly it's nice calling me an antisemite they haven't met my grandsons my son-in-law nieces that i a niece that i have nephews that i have brother in laws that i have jewish right come on and this this gives a really nice hopeful view of america is is is the integration of different different cultures different kinds of peoples that is a unique property of america yes but just to go back to where we started it was not smooth in the beginning all things are rough in the beginning all things are rough in the beginning what advice would you give to a young person today about how to have a career they can be proud of or a life they can be proud of well i think it's very important to make sure that you do something in life that really interests you my mother used to use this phrase floats your boat you wanna do something that floats your boat or to use another one of my mother's phrase phrases you wanna get up you wanna do something where you get up out of bed in the morning with a bounce in your step mhmm right so i i think that you know if your mother and father want you to be a lawyer and they're pushing you to be a lawyer and you don't wanna be a lawyer you wanna be a policeman be a policeman right don't do what other people want you to do because it's very important to find a job and occupation that you really love the second thing i would say and this has to do with your point about humility you wanna think about the humility hubris index my friend steve van ever who teaches at mit he and i invented this concept we call it the hubris humility index and you wanna have a healthy dose of humility mhmm but you also wanna have a healthy dose of hubris mhmm you you wanna think you can change the world you wanna think you can make things better for yourself you wanna take chances you wanna think sometimes that you know better than other people do hubris is not a bad thing but at the same time you have to have humility yeah you have to understand that a man or a woman has his or her limits and you wanna listen to other people you wanna be a good lister right so always remember the importance of the hubris humility index and the importance of having healthy doses of both hubris and humility speaking of humility you're mortal like all humans are do you ponder your mortality are you afraid of it are you afraid of death i'm not sure i'm afraid of death i i don't wanna die because i enjoy life so much too fun i'm yeah i you know given how horrible the world is today i hate to i hate to say that i'm having too much fun but do i find what i do interesting and gratifying i i i do i just love what i do and i love studying you know international politics and i love being intellectually curious about all sorts of subjects i love talking to you about this and that i mean this is really wonderful and i often tell people you know thank goodness i'm only twenty eight years old because i do try to behave like i'm only twenty eight years old but i am well aware of the fact that as my mother used to say nothing is forever and that includes me and when you're seventy five going on seventy six you understand that you have a limited number of years left and i find that depressing because i've been i've been very lucky and and i feel like i've won the lottery and i'm very thankful for that and i i'd like to you know make it last for as long as possible but i do understand that you know nothing is forever yeah the finiteness of things yeah you never think that when you're young i mean you know you think you're gonna live forever and you're just not gonna get old i never thought this would happen that i would become seventy five years old well you you got you got so much energy and boldness and fearlessness and if and and and excitement to you that i'm really grateful to see that especially given how much i'm sure you've been attacked for having bold ideas and presenting them and not losing yeah not losing that youthful energy is beautiful to see thank you not becoming cynical john it's a huge honor to
