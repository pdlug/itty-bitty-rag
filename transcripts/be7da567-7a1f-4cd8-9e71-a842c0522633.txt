the following is a conversation with mister beast the mastermind behind some of the most epic and popular videos ever made and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this podcast we got house of macadamias for a satiating and delicious snack eight sleep for you guessed it naps and better help for mental health choose wisely my friends snacks naps or mental health and now onto the full ad reads as always no ads in the middle i try to make this interesting but if you skip them please still check out our sponsors i enjoy their stuff maybe you will too this show is brought to you by house of macadamias it seems like it was just yesterday that they became a sponsor and i became aware of their existence because before they became a sponsor they sent a giant box of delicious snacks and it seems just like it was yesterday that i ate all of those snacks over a period of a few days and was a happier man for it this month i'm much stricter on my diet and trying to be much more responsible with my consumption of snacks i think moderation is key for that but in general i think first of all macadamia to me i think is one of the more delicious nuts but it is definitely the healthiest or at least one of the most healthy i think it's pretty much the healthy i remember when i first started keto many many years ago i did a bunch of research on which nuts i can and can't have i guess if i wanna be ultra low carb and everybody recommended mycadamias as like the one that has all these nutrients and all that kind of stuff i'm sure there's a lot of science you can look it up i think there's like omega sevens or whatever those different kinds of fats it doesn't matter the points are delicious and the raw ingredient of the macadamia nut that hassam macadamia's provides is just delicious and of course they do all kinds of snacks around that and my task whenever i do an ad read or talk to anybody like my neighbors or friends about house of academias is not to do any sexual innuendo that's job number one my brain is that of a silly person at heart i'm still a child and i will forever remain a child like that tom waits song i don't wanna grow up maybe that's not even the name of the song or the lyrics but i'm just gonna go with it and this is a good chance to mention that tom waits is somebody that i've dreamed of talking to on this podcast for a long time he's a very difficult interview to get he's dropped a few crumbs to me of hope you know saying like yes maybe one day so i hold on to that hope like i hold on to the delicious house of macadamia nuts with childlike joy in my eyes go to haasem macadamias dot com slash lex to get twenty percent off your first order this episode is also brought to you by eight sleep and its new pod three mattress there's been a few days over the past let's say three weeks where i've been extremely stressed because of several things going on in my life you know you know how life is it's an up and down process both the ups and downs contribute to the beauty of the whole experience anyway when things are kind of difficult i saw an escape in friends in books in moments of simple joy in moments of peace and i think the best escape is a good nap a full night's sleep of course but also a good nap it's kinda magical how much your mind can just become completely refreshed the beauty of the world can be richly rediscovered through the process of a nap it's incredible just twenty thirty minutes it's it's it's kind of amazing at least my brain is like that so sometimes when i'm feeling crappy i'll just give it a nap i'll give it a good night's sleep and see how i feel again in the morning and almost always if not right away just maybe a couple of times i feel better anyway that's why you wanna really make sure that the surface the the mattress all kinds of technology that you surround yourself with in terms of sleep you use the best stuff and that's why i look forward to sleeping on that cool surface that an a sleep cover provides it's just it's just incredible i look forward to naps and sleeps just because of that a sleep cover check it out and get special savings when you go to eight sleep dot com slash lex this episode is also brought to you by betterhelp spelled h e l p help speaking of the ups and downs of life i think it's interesting you know the kind of rollercoaster your mind can go on at least my mind can go on one moment i feel blissful and happy and everything is beautiful and one moment i feel cranky and just a little bit down and one of the things i've learned is to just kind of allow the passage of time to cure all things but i think that's not necessarily the full picture because you should probably treat your mental health very seriously and talk through it with a therapist you know there's some deep ocean of feeling there that may lay unexplored and it's i think beneficial to explore it with a with a good therapist i think one of the most accessible easiest ways to get access to a good therapist a licensed professional therapist is betterhelp that's why i'm a big supporter of what they do they i mean that's the really the first barrier is make it super easy and of course make it affordable and that's what betterhelp does check them out at better help dot com slash lex and save on your first month this is the lex fridman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's mister beast i'm here with mister beast the brilliant mastermind behind some of the most popular videos ever created do you think you'll ever make a video that gets one billion views i think maybe one of the videos we've already made might get a billion views which one do you think probably like the the squid game video with enough time i mean it's only a year old it's already on three hundred million or some of the newer ones we've we've done have gotten like a hundred million views in a month so those four projected over ten years because youtube's not going anywhere probably one of those so over time they don't necessarily plateau what's interesting we were literally jumping right into it i love it it's good so i i'm a firm believer that it's much easier to hypothetically get ten million views on one video than a hundred thousand on a hundred and part of why it's much easier in my opinion is like if you make a really good video it's just so evergreen and it never dies because youtube when you open up youtube and look at the videos they're just serving you whatever they they think you'll like the best you know and so if you just make a great video and it's constantly just above every other video you know eve even two years down the road then they'll just keep serving it and never stop you know which is why it's much easier to make one great video than a bunch of mediocre ones what about one billion subscribers you've passed pewdiepie is the most subscribed to youtube channel when do you think you get a billion let me do some math real quick so we're on a hundred and twenty so you think about this no i don't honestly i because one thing you'll find if you wanna gain subscribers if you wanna get views if you wanna make money any almost any metric in this video creation space if you want something it all comes back to okay well then just make great videos so instead of like focusing on all these arbitrary vanity metrics i just kinda focus on the one thing that gets me all that which is make good videos but and i i do think we will when they hit a billion subscribers i don't have a plan on going anywhere even though we're only on a hundred and twenty million right now on the main channel i think like we're doing around ten million a month now and youtube just yeah i just don't see it going anywhere and i i don't see any reason why i'd ever get burnt out or quit so i i think with enough time yes i wanted to ask you those family friendly questions before i go to the dark questions so now oh but we have dark questions wait no but if you wanted to hook them you would start off with the dark questions that that's how you get them okay well let me ask you about the a twitter poll you posted a ten thousand dollar death poll you tweeted if someone offered you ten thousand dollars but if you take it a random person on earth dies would you take the ten thousand dollars and forty five percent of people said yes that's at least at the time i checked eight hundred fifty thousand people committing murder for just eight point five billion dollars in total so what do you learn about human nature from that that's a a good question honestly it's this is like late at night when i threw that up too i was just like this will be a funny thing i assumed it'd be ninety percent no and like ten percent yes but there are a lot of serious people for you guys listening i i just did this random twitter poll where i was like would you take ten grand if it meant someone random in the world died yeah and a lot of the replies on this tweet were like hell yeah why not and i was just not expecting that and so i don't really know i mean i feel like your take would be better than mine was that disturbing to you surprising to you a little bit yeah but i you know obviously a lot of people were trolling but i act you you know when you read through those replies i do think like ten percent of them were like dead serious well i think sometimes the trolling and the lols reveal a thing we're too embarrassed to admit about the darker aspects of our nature so i don't know if you listen to dan carlin's hardcore history podcast he has a episode on painfotainment mhmm which he describes throughout history how humans have been really attracted to watching the suffering of others so public executions all that kind of stuff yeah and he believes that's in all of us that for example if something like a youtube or a different platform streamed the public execution or streamed the torture of another human being a lot of people would say that's deeply unethical but they will still tune in and watch and that we're we're attracted to that drama and especially the most extreme versions of that drama and so i think part of the lulls reveals something that's actually true in that poll that like your answer is so much better than mine do you think about that maybe even with the squid game like so i think how many how many views does the squid game currently have three hundred million yeah something like this so just imagine thought experiment how many views that video would get if it was like real yeah because assuming youtube was like oh we'll turn a blind eye we won't take it down yeah i mean it i've obviously it probably have billions of views how do you think you'll die and do you think it'll be during a video probably doing something dumb like going to space when i'm in older like trying to go to mars or or something like that i i know for a fact it won't be on a video every video we do with safety experts and stuff like that so it's it's not really a risk but yeah i could see myself like you know after a million people go to mars or something like that i'd probably be like you know what let's go and and something like that maybe so not in the name of a video just no for the helmet heck no are you open to taking risks when you shoot videos you just went to antarctica i mean like you're you're putting yourself on the line a little bit right of course but you know we we had that video in the works for three years and then we consult with tons of experts radar the entire path we're gonna walk beforehand to see if there's crevasses so we know there's no crevasses we do training we consult the experts and we have survival guides there with us and you know monitor the weather and everything so it's like any variable that where we could get harmed we just preplan for it same thing with buried alive like i had david blaine spent a a week underground and so i consulted with him and consulted with basically anyone who ever buried themselves alive you know we the coffin we used to bury me we did so many tests like that coffin was buried ten times before i was you know for a little longer than fifty hours it tested the airflow and everything to the point where i was safer in that coffin underground than i was above ground like so we just tend to just not leave anything up to chance you know another strange question then so you recorded these videos to yourself you know five years ten years from now have you recorded a video that's to be released once you die well first off i am just glad that not every one of your questions have to do with like views or things like that it's nice getting different questions so this is this is good no seriously slow dog slow dog slow dog slow dog but it's it's fine because a lot of people just do like how much money do you make you know it's just something i just everything's always about money now for when people talk to me so it's nice but for the videos i've made for you guys who probably don't follow me too closely when i had eight thousand subscribers and i was a teenager i filmed a bunch of videos and scheduled them years in the future and i said i'd film one where i was like hire me in a year and the video went up a year later and it was just like hey i think you'll have a hundred thousand subscribers and then i did one where i was like hide me in five years i was like hey in five years i think you'll have a million and then one that hasn't come out yet but comes out in two years is was hide me in ten years and i try to predict ten years later how many subs i'd have that's what he's referring to and yes there there are some that are scheduled like twenty years in the future and so if i don't dial just move them up and i remember because i filmed these though like seven years ago but it was i remember saying a line like you know if i'm dead then i'm currently just in a coffin and like whatever blah blah blah and because the only way the video would go up is if i'm not alive and if i'm not alive then i won't be able to push back the schedule upload date so it'll go public automatically yes and so yeah i have a couple of those like if i knew i was gonna die of like cancer or something and i had like three months to live i would vlog every day i'd film so many videos and then i would just schedule upload a video a week for like the next five years so it's like i'm still alive and i would completely act like i'm still alive and everything and i think something like that would be cool it's i don't know why but i've i've fantasized not fantasized but i've dreamt about that a lot like i don't know if if i only had thirty days to live what would i do and for me i would try to make like a decade's worth of content and schedule upload it so they automatically go public in the future and so it's just like i never died i'm just there yeah it's a kind of immortality but it's also a kind of troll on the concept of time yeah that you can die in the physical space but persist in the digital space i actually i recorded a video like that because i had some concerns and i just thought it's also a good exercise to do a video would like to be released if i die and it was actually a really interesting exercise it's cool like it shows like what you really care about i guess it's like writing a will but when you're younger you don't think about that kind of stuff but mine was just dumb yeah like i'm i'm bones in a coffin yeah yours is probably so serious no it's fun actually we we realize it's like there's no point to be serious at this point it's a weird thing i guess you've done this but it's a weird thing to address the world when you the physical you is no longer there so like you know this would only be released if you're no longer there exactly that's a weird exercise you know what's funny of all the people listening to this yeah you know we're probably the only two people that have made videos for when we die it's like such a niche thing and the fact that we're bonding over it's kind of funny i think people should think about doing that it's not just about youtube it's also social media because think about it like there's gonna be a last tweet and a last i don't know facebook post or last instagram post and yeah it's i feel like there's some aspect that's meditative to just even considering making a post like that and also it's a way for your the people that love you to kinda like celebrate do you think that would help them cope or not like if someone randomly watching this did film a video you know for if they accidentally died in some freak accident to be given to their family do you think that would and it was like a genuine i think it would really help i mean it depends because like like how would you even intro that like hey mom if you're seeing this you know it means i'm probably dead yeah exactly that's how you intro it that's the opener oh i just wanted you to know yeah i guess yeah and i i guess you could say it in a kind of funny way but and just talk about the things that you that mean a lot to you because otherwise you're at the risk of the last post you have is like like i don't know talking shit about like donald's mcdonald's my order exactly that's then you're dead that's it hundred years i don't know this i i i do recommend it it's like the stoics meditate on death every day in the same way you kinda meditate on your death when you make a video like that because it's actually not just even talking to yourself it's talking to the world and it like for some reason at least for me they made it very concrete that there's going to be an end and i'm like it's almost it's over for me if i'm making the video it's over for me it's just an interesting thought experiment i recommend people try it okay from are you afraid of death by the way yes i i it's hard because like what if you just die and then you just see nothing forever you know yeah the nothingness it just fades to blackness and you're just like that for trillions upon trillions to billion squared years and it's just it's scary but also before you're born you don't remember those what x amount of years either so that gives me a little comfort but no it's definitely very scary something i'd rather not think about until i'm like eighty i'll i'll deal with that problem then i i i don't know if i told you this but i'm kinda hopeful that someone like elon or one of these like freak smart people would just like be like you know what screw it i'm gonna figure out a way where we can slow down aging get it where you know we can live to be two three hundred years old and just like set their sights on that and then just kinda save us so it'd be really nice like it's it's almost absurd to think that in our lifetime they won't figure out a way to just even slightly slow down aging where we could live to be like a hundred and twenty or a hundred and thirty and then in that extra time they won't figure out some way where we could live to be two hundred like obviously not immortal but i don't i don't see how in my lifetime the life expectancy doesn't just expand well it also could be that the immortality is achieved in the digital realm like it could be long be long after you're gone as a mister beast run by a chad gpt type system exactly yeah that consumes everything i ever said everything i ever wrote and i don't want that i wanna live one of you smart people out there figure it out i'll keep you entertained but i need you to figure out how to keep me alive you know give me till two hundred that will make me happy well that's that's funny who owns the identity of of mister beast once the physical body is gone like are is it illegal to create another mister beast that's jadgpt based i don't know what the laws are on that yeah like i mean once i'm dead i i don't care wow but but you just said you did care i mean that could be a a ai like many mister beasts that are created after after you're gone yeah i mean that'd be cool to be able to like train up a model and and let them loose so my content lives on i guess yeah yeah but somehow feels like it diminishes the value you contribute yeah yeah it's inauthentic but it's also there's there's some aspect to the finiteness of the art being necessary for it to point us yeah once the second that thing starts spamming out videos yeah the videos lose all meaning and it's pointless and it's a money grab if you ran youtube for how long should you run it for a year how would you change it how would you improve it it's hard because you know obviously i'm biased because we're we're doing really well but i feel like when i open up youtube on my television i get the videos i wanna watch i don't i don't know i don't i don't ever open it and and wonder like what are these what are these ten videos on my home page when i click on a video my suggestion i don't ever wonder what these are like i i and maybe it's because i'm very adamant about like the kind of videos i watch and i try not to watch videos that i don't wanna get recommended more mhmm because i just that's how i think but i'm very happy with with how it is at the moment i think one thing though that i just hate with the passion is the comment section on youtube it's just so bad but that i know that's not something that's gonna ten x the growth of the platform but if you think about it you go to reddit to read comments and somehow like the you know usually the top twenty posts on a popular reddit post are not spam you know what i mean like have you ever clicked on something on the front page of reddit and then most upvoted reply to it is like go check out my site right here and it's like trying to scam you out of a thousand dollars yeah yeah i can't even think of one instance i've ever had that happen so like reddit it's so nice to click on posts and just see what people have to say and i almost wish like you had that same feeling when you read the comments on a youtube video instead it's like it's so many people just copy and pasting so many bots that just grab the top comment for your previous video and paste it over so the top comments on every videos are the same and the things that break through that are just scammers trying to get you to give them a thousand dollars for a free you know fake ad that comment section is one of the most lively on the internet so it'd be amazing if youtube invested in creating a natural community like where people could do high effort comments and be rewarded for it like on reddit yeah like actually right right out along that would make me so happy because like when i upload a video i usually go to twitter to see feedback like i i read my comments and i'll flip through newest but it's just i feel like reddit and twitter just give me so much better filtered feedback especially now that with twitter blue because people pay eight dollars a month the any i've noticed like any tweets i get from verified users now they're usually not just garbage troll takes like these are people paying eight dollars a month like they're usually relatively sensible and so it's been pretty nice like after i upload a video i just go on the verified time on twitter twitter and just see what people have to say and anyways i live for the day that youtube's like that what do you think about twitter what do you think about all the fun activity happening recently since elon yeah bought twitter i think he should make me ceo like i tweeted well i i should i should say sort of we had we just like a couple hours ago had a conversation with elon and you guys sent an exchange of some excellent ideas so yeah yeah i i i legitimately think obviously you're exceptionally busy but i legitimately think it'll be awesome if you somehow participate in the future of twitter yeah it would be fun because there's so much possibility of different ideas first in the sort of the the content like dissemination hosting and all the different recommendations like the search and discovery all the things that youtube does well i think the most exciting thing is he's you know willing to move fast and so i think there's gonna be a lot of interesting things that come out of it because he's just moving quick and a lot of these more mature platforms just take years to do the simplest stuff and and they're very bureaucratic and so it's gonna i mean it'll be interesting to see which way it goes when you just kinda take a move quick break things whatever type approach to social media i'm actually pretty curious to see what features he rolls out so what will be your first act as twitter ceo i can't spoil it okay i gotta get hired what do you think about video on the platform i mean do yeah do you think that's an interesting or is it like messing with the the medium the nature of the platform i think twitter will always be closer to tiktok than it is to youtube like at least in its current form like i don't i don't see twenty minute one hour long videos or whatever you know even fifteen minute videos being watched over there i see it more as like the short and snappy stuff closer to tiktok but at the same time twitter is a really good comment section for the internet i mean it's almost weird why like why doesn't twitter allow you to embed youtube videos like why why does that you should just ask elon that like i don't know if that's a youtube thing but when a youtuber posts a video why do they have to link to youtube why can't they just embed it on twitter and just play it there i mean wouldn't that just solve a lot of problems yeah but then the two companies would have to agree to integrate each other's content i don't know but it seems like a win win i mean well it's more of a win for twitter because then people don't have to leave the platform i mean that that'd be the the easiest thing but who gets like when you watch the ads on a youtube video that's embedded in twitter who gets the money it would still be youtube but at least then right now people just post a link and it takes you off twitter and it just kills your session time on twitter that's really interesting but the the yeah because the twitter whatever the the dynamics of the comments especially once the spam bots are taken care of twitter just works it's really so reddit is a nice comment section for the internet it's like slower paced more deliberate like higher effort twitter's like this high paced like ephemeral kinda stream but there's the vote the upvoting and the downvoting works much better because you could do retweeting right because the social network is much stronger than it is on youtube like the interconnectivity changes on reddit you're gonna get the the top replies are gonna be the most refined ones whereas twitter stuff floats to the top that's not super refined but like you're saying it's more off the cuff stream of consciousness which a lot of people prefer because it's a little more personal how do you think twitter compares to youtube in terms of how you see its future unroll in twenty twenty three i mean i think youtube's gonna be youtube and not much is really gonna change but it's gonna keep growing just because you know that's just what it does and because it's owned by google but twitter i don't know i mean it's one of those things like you you you can't predict if like you know a year from now an economy is gonna be in a recession or booming and i think twitter's kinda the same thing one thing's for certain a lot of things are gonna be rolled out but who knows honestly you responded to elon saying twitter's unlikely to be able to pay creators more money than youtube why do you think that is well yeah because i i think the tweet i responded to is one where he was saying that they you know users will jump over if twitter could potentially pay more than other platforms and i was just saying obviously because google has google adwords and i mean that's google's whole thing it's putting ads on stuff they've been doing it better than anyone else in the world for a very long time it's very unlikely in the next few years that twitter is gonna just magically or any platform you know give a creator the ability to make higher cpms than on youtube it's it's kinda crazy like some creators in in december you know q four because ad rates are higher because of christmas and everything some creators literally make like thirty forty dollars per thousand views and that's after youtube's cut like it's almost like hard to think about like how high the rpms get and even then once you pull out a finance and cars the high cpm niches and you move into just normal stuff it's still just crazy the sheer volume of creators and the fact that all of them get these multidollar cpms at scale it's pretty beautiful so you do i don't know what you would call them but like integrated ads in your videos and you do i would say masterfully it's like part of the video talking about brand deals brand deals is that what you would call that yep so it's a brand deal it's part of the video it's still really exciting to watch and yet there's a plug for the brand in general just brand deals since you brought it up integrating them well i think that's something a lot of creators don't do like they'll just do a brand new out of the blue they'll just be filming a video and then around the three minute mark just start talking about a random company yeah and you i feel like if you don't want viewers to click away and you want people to not get pissed off and call you a sellout you gotta find a way to integrate into content and ideally use the money in the video to make it better like is the easiest thing you do when you do a brand deal is just tell people how you're using money from the brand deal to make your content better and if you do that like no one cares now they're supporting you for it and you go from being a sellout to like oh i'm doing this to make better videos for you guys you know i don't know if you can share but with those brands when you have discussions with them are they strict about how long you need to be talking about it or is it more about they're leaving control to you about the artistic element of it the problem is the the ones who don't give us the artistic element we just don't really work with anymore sure yeah because it's just you know we get a hundred million views of video now and i've can confidently say i know how to entertain them and convert them better than these random brands so yeah if if they don't give us that freedom i just won't work with them so you have that leverage but for smaller creators it's a lot harder yeah and they're they're gonna just say forty five seconds here's what you say take it or leave it and it's like pretty brutal because i think just in general if brands were more accommodating to let creators tell their story of the brand and talk about the brand in a way that felt a little more natural i i think it'd be a it'd be less cringe people would be less likely to go you know tap tap tap skip and obviously it would convert better but they're just so afraid and they want this standardized thing say these words in forty five seconds right here at this three minute mark yeah i often think about how to resist that you just don't do them though right not on youtube right i do on the audio i do ads in the very beginning and i say you can skip them if you want gotcha but the brand loves that no i don't like the point is they so the funny thing about podcast is different than than youtube videos podcast people actually do listen to ads a lot because they it's slower paced and they like the the creator voice like talking about the thing but in general i just don't believe you should be talking about a thing for a minute exactly and that's going to be effective i wanna see the data for that i think what's much more effective is the way you do ads which is like integrating into the content like put a lot of effort into making a part of that like doing the brand deals and i just it's difficult to have that conversation it's like a very strenuous conversation you have to have with with brands you have to have each one at a time and i just wish there was more of a culture to say like the quality of the ad read matters a lot more than the like the silly parameters like the timing of it like how long it is the placement of it all that kind of stuff what percentage of your viewers do you think have seen one of my videos before what percentage of the viewers on youtube right yeah of of your viewers of the viewers on youtube though yeah is it most of the people okay sure or or all of them all of them it's just interesting because you're you're speaking very specifically like about my brand deal process and so in my head i'm like i wonder what percentage of these people even have any idea what he's talking about that's interesting i love the thinking about numbers the whole time we're having this conversation it's all i could think about it's like god goddamn it he's there's probably like fifty percent of these people have no fucking clue what he's saying probably and we're about to torture him for five minutes yeah yeah probably but that's something i can't turn off in my brain less less than fifty percent is that a good thing or a bad thing is that exciting to you that that there's like fifty percent of people don't not watch the mr beast video isn't that an opportunity to like yeah i guess it's an opportunity to grow i don't know honestly i was just kind of excited to hang out with you yeah yeah me too though i mean just the day was a lot of fun who cares if there's mics yeah yeah so it was kinda like having a buddy to go along the journey as i'm just kinda eating shit and doing my normal grind it was like kind of fun and also you just say really wise stuff constantly so honestly no i never even put any thought into like the demographics or what i could gain it's just interesting because like my retention brain when you talk about something i'm instantly like what value are they gonna get how many of them are gonna be interested what percentage of people do i think will lose and i'm like running all those calculations in the background and that whole conversation like the lot anyway it's just something i can't turn off my like bells are like error error this is bad what are the different strategies for high retention for your videos and in general it's like how how do you cook good food you know what i mean that's like the same kind of question i see so there's so many different ways that you so it it boils down to i mean do you think at the at the level of a story or do you think like literally watching five seconds at a time am i gonna tune out here am i gonna tune out here am i gonna tune out here it's all of it you need the overarching narrative and then you also need the micro where every second you know needs to be entertaining and you basically what's interesting is the longer people watch something the more likely they are to keep watching so you don't have to try as hard in the hypothetically back half of a video as you do in the front like even right now we're so deep into this where a lot of people listening are probably just gonna keep listening relatively close to the end unless we just have a really boring part of this conversation because they're just they're just in it they're they're immersed and so a big like to really boil it down to a simple level you just wanna get people where they're immersed in the content and then just kinda hold them there we had this discussion offline and by the way i should mention that this is like late at night it is what time is it's nine o'clock and i i only slept one hour last night because i'm an idiot and i flew to the wrong location well here we're like hey let's just book you a hotel to fly he's like no i got it we're like you sure we we can just do it we always do this he's like no i got it i got it he's gonna have to rub it in yeah i know and then today come to find out he flew to the wrong airport airport with the or a city with a similar name to ours just same name yeah same name in a different state and i was like that's why you should have let us book it and so he saw one hour of sleep and he's literally been dying all day before this podcast he downed like two things of coffee we've been going all day hard yeah i've been got to interact with you i i should say that this gave me an opportunity to i got a ride from a stranger and it was an incredible person i got to interact with him so it's like there's so many kind people around here just like this kinda southern energy and then i got to go to a diner because i could you know there's only one hour between me arriving and having to fly out so i went to a diner there's a there's a really kind waitress that called me honey so that's a beautiful moment you know i was so confused you you tweeted about that and like steel's like like my my assistant was like lex isn't here yet yeah and i saw your tweet and i was like he's here yeah he was like no he's still flying i was like four like an hour ago he just tweeted about a nice diner yeah it it was i didn't realize you it was a diner it it was a diner in a different state and then you had to fly over here yeah that was and then i called you you didn't answer i was like i was like something's not adding up yeah i feel like it's such an idiot because apparently the world has cities like springfield right mhmm like there's like every single state has a springfield oh really i i think so i think that's a whatever that's like a simpsons joke right that like it's the the city and and and the simpsons is springfield and i think every single state or most of them have a springfield and the same is true for like georgetown i think the most pop i forget what the most popular one was but there's like a list of these people get when they run out of ideas they just keep these in the same row achilles' heel anyway i got to i got to meet a bunch of people from from your team they're just an incredible human being so let me just ask on that topic how do you hire a great team like what have you learned about hiring for everything for for the main channel that you do for the the react the gay the the gaming channel to mister reese burger to feastables all that the big thing is especially in this content creation because it's not like anything that's done on netflix or or different content medians i i really need people who are coachable and like really see the value in what i care about because it's a very specific way of going about things and it's a like a thing you there's no one like plug and play like if netflix wanted to hire someone to do a documentary there's probably tens of thousands of people you could hire that have worked on documentaries before but if you wanna hire someone to make super viral youtube videos you know like we do there's just no one you you can really pull from like sometimes i'll hire people from game shows right they have all these preconceived notions about pacing and how a video should be and you have to spend like the first year like breaking all these habits and you know and they think they're better than you like a lot of people in traditional think they're better and they think their way is better than what we do and so for me it's almost easier to hire people that are are just hard workers that are obsessed and really coachable and just train them how to like be good at content creation and production than to hire someone from like traditional which is the only way to really do it because there's not that many youtube channels that have scaled up so it's not like there's a huge talent pool of people who've worked on youtube channels so it's easier just to train someone than just pull them from traditional because traditional people just i don't know they have all these opinions and things and they just think our way of going about things is dumb yeah so you want people who have the humility to have a beginner's mind even if they have experience see the value like actually a lot you'll still get it it's so crazy like especially some of my other friends that are scaling up their youtube channels there's people that will come on and you'll ask them like what do you wanna be doing in five years and instead of saying oh i wanna be working on this channel they'll be like oh i hope to be working on movies or this and they see like working on a youtube channel is a launchpad to go into traditional and it's like no like you just don't get it this is the future this is the end goal this is your career and so i'm just so tired of having those kinds of conversations like i feel like people really should be coming around are there like recurring interview questions that you ask is there is there ways to get yeah but the biggest thing is like what what do you wanna be doing in ten years and if their answer isn't you know making content on youtube or you know if their answer is anything like movies or traditional stuff like that it's like just a hell no like it just won't even remotely work oh so you really want people to believe in the vision of youtube yeah i mean ideally it's like oh working here you know what i mean so it's less about the medium and more about just being on a great team that's doing epic stuff yeah well and yeah the medium as well because those it's just it's hard to put into words but there's it's just two completely different ways of going about things you know like our videos aren't scripted and you know it's a lot more run and gun and when we if we hypothetically blow up a a giant car or whatever like you only have one take you know what i mean so and it's not scripted and so you have to over film overshoot things overcompensate for like the dumb way of going about it and a lot of traditional people would be like well just plan what you're gonna say and just plan the angles you can cut the cameras in half you can save fifty grand here you can save you know seventy five thousand dollars editing this and that and it's like yeah but that's not authentic you get it it's almost so obvious that it hurts to have to constantly have these conversations but it's the world we live in but there's also detail like there's a taste like i've watched a bunch of videos with you and it's clear to you that you've gotten really good i don't know what the right word is style or taste to be able to know what's good and not in terms of retention in terms of yeah just stylistically visually i don't have to think i can just watch a video and and it just it just screams in my head like this is what this is what should change based on the you know million videos i've watched and all these viral videos i've consumed like this is blah blah blah what's optimal and things like that it's almost like your brain's like a you know like a a neural net and like if you consume enough viral videos and enough good content that you just kinda start to like train your brain to like see it and see these patterns that happen in all these viral videos and so that anytime i watch a video or a movie or anything i just can't stop thinking about what is optimal and so it's like it gives me a headache sometimes when i watch something too slow or i don't think is optimal obviously my taste isn't the end all be all but that's something that kinda torments me if that makes any sense oh you can't enjoy a slow moving no i can't movie and and that's not to say there was attention on the godfather is horrible yeah no exactly i've tried to watch that movie like three times but and that's not to say slow movies are bad like there's an audience for it it's just obviously not what i've trained my brain to like and and social media and youtube right now like that's just not the meta and in general like you said in neural network you're training your brain in part on actual data right so you're actually it's data driven so you're looking at like in terms of thumbnails and titles and different aspects of the first five ten seconds and then throughout the video the retention all that you're looking at all of that for your own videos to understand how to do it better so that's where the neural network is training yeah basically there are ways you can kinda see like the most viewed videos on youtube every day and stuff like that i just kinda consume those every single day and i've been doing that for way too many years and then you just start to notice patterns like the thumbnails on the most viewed videos or videos that go super viral tend to be clear tend to not have much clutter tend to be pretty simple titles tend to be with less than fifty characters intros tend to be this stories tend to be this and you just kinda like after you see those thousands and then tens of thousands of time it just starts to click in your head like this is what it looks like you know so how are you able to transfer that taste that you've developed to the team so for like because you said like broad things but i'm sure there's a million detailed things like what zoom to use on the face to use in the thumbnail right like the answer is whatever makes the best video because the problem is the more which i i have so many friends who are like this they'll make like checklists for their editors so like you know this beat and this beat and you need to have like a three part arc and then this but the the problem is that's how you the the more constraints you put on the team the more repetitive and less innovation you get and the more yeah like you know after ten videos people are gonna be like alright i've already seen this so to me and i'm twenty four and you know i'm probably my mindset will change over the next ten years i just haven't been in this industry too long but the only way to like really make innovative content and keep things fresh is to not put constraints on or put as little as possible and so that's why i'm very hesitant on all that stuff because the more i say the more they're gonna be like oh then that's what we do and then you know i'll say one time like oh you know ideally there's a cut every three seconds and then next thing you know yeah every video there's a cut every three seconds or whatever so it's it's hard because i try to give as little train not training but as little facts or as possible and and more just make suggestions if that makes any sense mean publicly or to your team to my team yeah what was so you talked about sort of teaching your voice or your style whatever we wanna call it to other people on the team so they can be kinda a mister beast replacement so what's the process of teaching that so you don't wanna no i got you because you're you're more talking about like what i would call almost like cloning right like like tyler and other people like that yeah so when we were hanging out today i was showing him how we have multiple people in the come it's it's almost like talking to the camera to have it yeah each turn slowly to the camera i was like it is habit is it weird to you to not be looking at the camera this whole interview i constantly have been turning towards the camera like that i'm talking to him yes it's it's a habit yeah because my whole life i've just been talking to a camera who are you thinking about when you're looking at the camera do you like imagine somebody i'm fully thinking about the person just sitting watching it and i almost it's weird when i'm looking at the camera i don't see a camera i'm like in a haze picturing what the viewer is seeing when they watch it yeah does that make sense and that's where i'll be saying things and or doing something and then like when i'm watching i'm like that's not what i want and then i'll freeze up it's very weird when i'm filming and then for people who haven't worked with me too much they'll think like i don't know it's very weird like the how i go about it because i'll just be doing whatever like lighting a firework alright this is a thousand dollar firework and i'll go to light it i'll be like and i'll like freeze because in my head i'm like this i don't know i don't like how that flow or how that shot look because i it's weird i can perfectly picture what i'm filming by just looking at the camera and then putting myself through the lens of the camera while making content it i can do it at the same time so you're like real time editing am i the video yeah that's something that didn't at the start come natural to me but in the last probably like five years it it's happened and so i would say it's one of my greatest strengths but i don't know how i developed it but anytime i'm filming anything like it's almost like the like right side of my brain i just can just look at it and i see exactly what i'm filming and i can just picture it well it's probably do recording the video being the talent for the video and then watching the editing and like analyzing it carefully and do that over and over yeah when you do that and over you tell thousand times yeah you do the editing more than the being in front of the camera so like you you start to see yourself from that third person perspective exactly then maybe that actually helps with the nerves of it too like you see it as creating a video versus performing right yeah yeah i think so you know i it's weird i've never been nervous talking to a camera it's it's harder for me to talk to a person than it is to talk to a camera which i feel like a lot of people say that though that are whatever make content right interesting i've i've heard that so many times or maybe not maybe i'm just awkward and dumb maybe they're practiced i to me it's i mean both are terrifying but being in front of the camera by yourself is most much easier really yeah so much easier i prefer it a million times over but that's my whole life you know so it's just that's why it's interesting like you've spent more of your time talking to people yeah it comes natural and i talk to a piece of plastic oh yeah i guess you're talking to a person too they're just sitting on the other side of the camera yeah there's just a pixel on the screen so so cloning how do you how do you achieve oh yeah that's right this whole rabbit show so i was showing him that i have a lot of people in the company who are able to think like me and basically make decisions like i would make if i was like if you were asked hey in this video should we climb a mountain or should we dig a hole right and like you know they would pick the same answer i'd pick ninety plus percent of the times and so like one example is tyler who i was showing you and he was pitching some content and you could see like this he was on point and basically for just four or five years we just spent an absurd amount of time together and worked on every single video together and we worked side by side and same thing with my ceo james he literally lived with me for a couple years i'm a big fan of just like finding people who are super obsessed and all in and a players that you know they really just wanna be great and they're just dumping everything i have in them and like you were saying because i'd love to find that and develop that you're saying you're basically for a long time just said everything you were thinking to them exactly like james the the guy who's basically my right hand in right now for two years he lived with me and we probably talked on average of those two years to seven hours a day i mean anytime i had a phone call i'd throw it on speaker and i'd let him listen anything i was reading any content i was consuming like really just training his brain to think like me so that way he could just do things without my input without me having to constantly watch over him or give him advice and and that's where we've gotten like so for the first six months he didn't do anything he just studied me and studied everything i cared about and how i spoke and blah blah and then the next six months he started taking on some responsibilities and now he can just run the company and you know i i don't ever really have to check-in on him like i most of the decisions he makes are exactly what i would do and so i i call that cloning i don't know what other people would but it's just like finding people that are really obsessed and they just kinda really want it and just feeling like giving them an avenue to like get it if that makes any sense another way to see it is you're converging towards a common vision and that makes like brainstorming much more productive yeah it just makes it where i don't have to be so involved in everything because i just have these people i know will think like i will at least relatively close to it so i can kinda almost be in multiple places at once per se and so these things that you know i still approve every idea we film and you know everything before we film and all the creative i approve it but i don't have to like be in the weeds and nuances and do all this minor stuff i can just let them handle it i can just do the more macro things i got a chance to sit in to a lengthy brainstorming session with tyler and others that was really cool can you talk about the process of that of people pitching ideas and you pitching alternatives or shutting down ideas and it's just going like plowing through ideas very quickly you kinda just described exactly what we did yeah i mean but the ideas are really really good it's just tossing out like different categories of ideas and then also fine tuning them to see like how do i change like thinking about the titles and the song i work so well off of inspiration it's like it's something like give give me any word i don't know like a relative space space yeah like i went to space you know what happens if you blow up a nuke in space or i went to the moon i went to mars right because you said that one word it was able to inspire me to come up with four ideas and so that's just it's for me if you the way to get a hundred million views on videos you need something original creative something people really need to see ideally never been done before all these like things and so you need like if you wanna consistently go super well you need just a constant stream of ideas and the only way i've really found that i can consistently come up with hundred million view videos is to intake inspiration and then see what my brain outputs and so that's kinda at its core foundation what i'm doing there it's just like in taking a lot of random inspiration to see what spawns in my mind so i can output it but the neural network of your brain is generating the video the title the thumbnail all like jointly right exactly and that only comes because i spent ten years of my life just obsessively studying all that stuff because you i mean it seems like you would literally potentially shut down a video just because you can't come up with a good title yeah or a good thumbnail or a thumbnail yeah i mean that's what happened to seventy percent of those in that pitch session i was just like oh what was one of them genius versus a hundred people or yeah like maybe average intelligence versus genius stuff like that or yeah i was like what the heck is the thumbnail even if the title was good yeah yeah i mean there's so many but yeah people don't click they don't watch that's so interesting but you developed over time the ability to kinda give it what what what makes for a good title short not just short it's also i mean if someone reads it are they like do they have to watch it is it just so intrinsically interesting that it's just gonna fuck with them if they don't click on it you know what i mean so it doesn't have to be short but it has to be like you almost want to have a retention to word by word reading ideally it's a title also that you know because the titles don't live in a vacuum right so it has to lead into the content so ideally the title represents content that you would wanna watch for twenty minutes so if it's a twenty minute video and the title is i stepped on a bug it's not gonna because it's all of it combined the the click through rate is gonna be much lower and then if it was like a five second video people might click it so you gotta like even nuances of the length of the video based against the title will affect whether people wanna click it because sometimes they just all add up i mean it's that yes ideally you want it below fifty characters because above fifty characters on certain devices you run the chance of it going dot dot dot so like i took a a light pole and i saw how many dollar bills i could stack on top and they would just go dot dot dot because it's too long and it can't finish it and that's the worst thing because then people don't even know what they're clicking on and so it's gonna do even worse short simple ideally and just so freaking interesting to have to click and it is a good segue into the content and it represents the length of the content and there's probably stuff you it's hard to convert convert into words for you like i stepped on a bug versus stepping on a bug versus mister b stepped on a bug versus i mean that that bug stepping in a bug that up so it's like yes the more extreme the opinion typically the higher the click through rate if you can like pay it off in the content then it just supercharges it so like oh so you have a kind of estimate of the extreme like this this water right if you're like fiji water sucks yeah that'd do fine but if you said fiji water is the worst water bottle or the worst water i've ever drank in my life yeah way more extreme opinion would do way better but you have to deliver yeah but then you have to deliver because the more extreme you are the more extreme you have to be in the video yeah that's almost inspiration for you to step up yeah but you can you can be more extreme in a positive way a lot of peep it's easier though positive negative clickbait is much easier than positive clickbait it just is it's so much easier to get negative clicks and so a lot of people are just in my opinion you know a little bit lazier and they just take the route like oh well this one gets the same amount of clicks it's and it's easier less effort the positive one is doing a large number of numbers of something like i i spent this number of hours doing this or whatever if you just wanted to help people or right it's just harder to get ten million views on a video helping people than it is to get ten million views on a video tearing down a celebrity you know what i mean or whatever negative video you wanna insert there well that said most of your videos are pretty positive yes so what's but there not a lot of people do those kinds of videos because they're hard yeah they're hard yeah some of that is giving away money right yeah what's the secret to that what's how do you do do that right yeah like give give away money or in a video that may to make it compelling is it so there's a number that is better than another number right the higher number is always better than the lower number yeah for the most part and you know it's interesting like some videos will give away a million dollars some videos will give away half a million there's not really i guess so i'm retracting what i just said i was more joking with that but there's no difference whether i put five hundred k or a million there's probably not even really a difference between a hundred k or a million i haven't really looked into it like some of our mostly videos are not not us giving away a million dollars and sometimes the million dollar videos just don't do as well as the other ones so there there is a certain point where a dollar amount is just a large dollar amount to an average human and so i think that point is a hundred k like anything above a hundred k the average human is just like that's a lot of money you know it doesn't it doesn't a hundred k and a million like doesn't really move the needle does that make sense is which that's a very nuanced piece of information that applies to very few people but yeah well no i think it applies it's fascinating it's fast human our relationship with money is fascinating like why is it so exciting to get i mean i you know the times i found like twenty bucks in the ground are like incredible really i don't know why right why why are you so happy like what exactly is so joyful about that i mean it depends where you are in in life what the situation is yeah i don't know there's also a gamified aspect to it it's exciting yeah no i get it like why people wanna see people win money it's just interesting that past a hundred grand it's it doesn't really seem to make a difference like it's the same basically so you found that to be true with all the money you've given away that i just didn't click through it like obviously in terms of someone receiving it yeah a million dollars changes their life drastically more like that's the difference like oh you if you wanted to you could really quit your job as opposed to hundred k is like not really you probably do like a a scientific study like a formula giving away money to click through rate yeah there could be some kind of diminishing return it definitely the the returns level off dramatically after a hundred k that's basically the premise what about ten thousand no there's ten a hundred thousand is that it's it's funny because this is such a small niche thing but yeah a hundred thousand does from what i see in our videos get more clicks than ten thousand but the difference between a hundred thousand and a million is just so little i just i think big number big number to a lot of people past that point yeah so for a hundred thousand you can like give an average salary you can probably live for a year given given what they have average salaries in america so that's like a big that feels yeah i think it's also just more when they read the title it's just like it's a lot of zeros it's a lot of fuckloads of zeros okay click you know yeah oh man that's fascinating so on the thumbnail side again that's gonna be much harder to say probably but you know offline you know i got a chance to look at a bunch of thumbnails and it's fascinating which ones do well and which ones don't is there something you could say about what are the elements of the thumbnail that work well or is this also deeply instinctive yeah it's the same thing like how do you cook good food but i it it's easier if you pull up a thumbnail i could be like that's why that's good that's why that's bad that's a like an example would be like one of my friends i was he just uploaded a video recently and i called him i was like what is this because he's a very very smart guy and in the thumbnail he's he's getting chased by cops but the cops were wearing yellow vests so they didn't look at cops so i was like well why are the cops in your thumbnail wearing yellow vests it's like that makes it so much more boring and he was like carrying a a flag but the pole and the color of the flag were the same color so it's like it's a lot harder to see the flag i was like also you're wearing like a shirt with like five different colors like so it's like it's hard to tell what even what your outline is and then in the background there are cars and i was like well if you have cops chasing you why not make the cars cop cars and you know and it's like because in my head i'm like dang if you just did those like four or five things the video probably woulda got like seven x of the views how much iteration because i also got a chance to see the number of iterations you do on a on a just a button thumbnail it's a problem now that it's an addiction is it so you kinda kinda because a lot of the versions are really good yeah how do you know when to like i love how you when we pulled up that the burger one and we're flipping the room you're like that's really good i was like oh that's version of like one of like a thousand but even the sketch the idea was good like already even the original idea is strong yeah so we one of our coming up videos we made the world's largest plant based burger and the thumbnail we were thinking is like me standing beside the burger because it's six feet tall that's that's what he's talking about so like just picture a giant six foot tall burger super wide thousands of pounds and then i'm beside it and then it's like eating the world's largest burger like you that's just something you have to click like so you were saying like how would you describe a good thumbnail like that you know what i mean like but i think you said the one i noticed first that was good where you were very small in it relative to the and you didn't like that one i think i needed to come forward a little bit and also i the photo we took was just my upper body yeah so they photo manipulated and created my legs photoshopped and that's why i said i didn't like it because my right leg was a little like off it was like bent the wrong way because i see i know it's also like those legs in photoshop well i mean does the physics in the thumbnail have to even make sense i mean you can just like exaggerate the head size and all that kind of stuff right hundred percent yeah things don't have to be relative yeah you can have a car in the background it'll be three times the size yeah because yeah every one of my thumbnails my face is in the you know left side very big so brand recognition so just people know oh especially because now that a lot of people copy our videos it's just nice to like you know everyone else might make thumbnails like this but this is mine yeah and obviously we usually over deliver and do bigger stuff would you recommend to other creators that wanna that wanna make it big to and they see mister beast and then look up to you to copy some elements of you or to really try to be unique unique one hundred percent unique you're not the next mister beast quote unquote feels weird saying that third person but whatever is not gonna do what i'm doing better they're gonna just invent their own lane like you're just not gonna do what i do better than me you know i have so many i literally have the best people in the world working here and i i reinvest everything i make even to this day you know what i mean like it's absurd the amount of money i spend on content and i don't care i'll just stop sleeping and i'll just film every other day like you're just not gonna beat me at my own game and that's fine you shouldn't like i didn't get where i am by just beating someone else at their own game i just found my own lane and innovated and adapted and so yeah there's a lot of people that do copy me and it's fine whatever do it but just know you're not gonna get to where i am doing that and so i'd advise you don't you give away a lot of the secrets basically everything yeah about how you operate is there i don't hold anything back go for it you know how do you think about that because that's also that's pretty rare i think and this is definitely not most people in my stance i don't think would take this or my position would take this stance but i see every other youtuber or so person on social media even because we're also focused super heavily on youtube but last year we were also the most followed tiktok creator in the world as well actually we're most subscribed to youtube channel in the world and the most followed tiktok account in the world but in general i just see everyone else as collaborators not competitors i i don't think giving advice and helping other creators do well in any way harms me and i think it only brings more value to my life how was it jumping on tiktok and trying to understand that platform from scratch yeah so from being a successful youtuber to understand a totally different algorithm fundamentally different algorithm what's that like it's interesting well not even just the algorithm just the content like i'm going from basically fifteen minute short films to one sub one minute vertical content it's a whole different just ballpark and so the first little while i was doing tiktok it was just kinda figuring out how what what does mrbeast look like in this short form content but recently we've really started to catch our stride and come up with some original concepts and figure out how to innovate over there just like we did on youtube because i don't want it i didn't want it to just be shitty youtube videos yeah you know and so like an example is we played the rock for a hundred k in rock paper scissors and the loser had to donate a hundred k to charity we did we we went to random people on a campus and we we offered them so i said i'll give you a hundred dollars if you fly to paris to give me a baguette and then they said no and i was like i will give you three hundred dollars if you fly to paris to give me a baguette and i was expecting this person to say no and to go up to like ten grand and he's like yes and so he flew to paris got a baguette and brought it back and gave it to me and that across everything got like four hundred and fifty million views and it because it's just really cool just to see this random guy get on a plane spend a day in paris and we cut it up real nicely and bring it back and so we're starting to find just tons of original content over there but it seems like an epic video to make for one minute exact no one on shortform's doing it that's the thing it's like it's just so funny because like tiktok's been big for a while now years and then you know as as we start to really figure out things on the youtube channel and get it cranking where i have some free time we we set our sights on tiktok and like okay what what are people not doing how do we make it better put in more effort make it good and we did the same thing we did at youtube just different over on tiktok and it worked and yeah now we're the fastest growing or most followed tiktok account in twenty twenty two and it's just funny that no one else did that and you're not afraid to do epic stuff which i also during the brainstorming some some of the ideas you were like that's better as a short that's crazy yeah can you remember one because i remember i said that a bunch bunch i can't think of one all i remember is that they were like epic videos like really you're going to do that for a one minute video yeah that's crazy so like are you posting similar content to a youtube short as a tiktok yeah those we just double up it's just hard you know what's actually pretty fascinating and people who do social media listening to this will probably find this pretty interesting is picture like the content creation meta three years ago versus now where you can make sub one minute vertical content and it go viral on tiktok and go viral on youtube shorts go viral on instagram reels it goes viral on facebook it goes reddit you know you swipe through vertical content now and twitter when you click on a video and you flip through it so this is actually very weird this is the first time in the history of i guess western social media that one form of content could actually go super viral on every single platform it's never been like that before so they're going viral individual they're not like like interbreeding or whatever i can post something on tiktok that will get a hundred million views and then post it on shorts and it'll get two hundred million views and then post it on instagram and i get fifty million views and then you know i haven't yet but you know you can then turn around and tweet it and get tens of millions of views and you can post it on reddit and get tens of millions of views and and facebook can get tens of millions of views and that's that just wasn't a thing three years ago twitter didn't have when when because a lot of you probably don't even know this but when you tap on a video now and you swipe down it just turns into tiktok that wasn't a thing even a year ago reddit that wasn't a thing a year ago probably two years ago that wasn't a thing on instagram three years ago that wasn't a thing on youtube right with youtube shorts so this is all new and i don't it's weird i haven't heard a single person talk about it but this is the first time where content can actually go viral on every single platform and you don't have to write or film a video for facebook film a twelve minute video for youtube film a sub sixty second video for tiktok write a tweet for twitter and post this on reddit you can just do the same thing on every platform and the fact that your content has gone viral on multiple platforms regularly means that virality is not accidental or sometimes it can be of course but it's it's just not it can be engineered yeah so many people say it's luck and they're like you're just lucky or this or that but what what are we up to probably like a thousand videos over ten million views like we don't ever have a dud like you could call it luck but i think it could be trained i i i counsel youtubers all the time and and show them how to go from getting a couple million views a month to ten millions views a month very easily and for even certain ones like just one of my friends like he was just really struggling and so i just started showing him basically everything i know and just doing like once every week sometimes once every two weeks calls and it went from ten thousand dollars a month on youtube to over four hundred thousand oh just doing these little counseling calls and so i mean people can make excuses all they want and say it's just luck or say you know well anyways i don't even wanna quote all the other stuff but it's just it is it is a teachable skill it's a learnable skill you can study your way to consistently make viral videos no matter how small your channel is even if you have zero subscribers you could if if you actually studied hard enough and like basically if you knew what i knew and some of these so i don't sound so arrogant also like some of these other friends that have that i'd say are the smartest people in the world when it comes to content creation online if you had the knowledge that was in our heads you could do it very easily i i see people do it all the time and what's even more interesting is i go on podcast and i say everything i know and these people are also very open some of them i know it's all out there and a lot of people instead of just studying that and trying to absorb and apply it in their own way they're just like no it's just luck you know so you do lay it all out there but i gotta push back to one interesting thing i i think a crucial component of your success is the idea stage the idea generation the brainstorm i heard today but getting really good at generating ideas so it's not it's not just the the selection of the thumbnail and the title that creative process it's also just the the the engine of generating really good ideas of course and getting that i mean i i would say that is probably the thing that needs to be trained the most for most creators right that they're they just don't put enough ideas on paper yes but also a lot of creators also just don't you know which i didn't either for the longest time just didn't don't make good enough content you know content that's worthy of getting ten million views in the idea or the execution of the idea both i mean like think about how many people just make videos they film in under twenty minutes and they don't really put any effort into it and like you know it's like my first five hundred videos didn't deserve to get a million views like there's a reason they did they're terrible you know what i mean but at the time i thought they did right and i'm i'm in the mindset of a lot of small youtubers where i thought those videos deserved a million views and i thought the algorithm hated me but i watch them back now and i could tell you exactly why the videos are just fucking horrible you know what i mean well so what was the breakthrough for you to start realizing to start having a self awareness you know about these videos aren't good enough you're probably still going through that you're probably still growing to see like yeah every six months you should look back and hate your videos or or at least see things you could improve and be like oh i could've done this better that better if not then you're not learning quick enough in my opinion at least where's the source of that learning even for you now looking at that back from a no i mean i just got back from a mastermind where i just got like you know ten of the smartest people i knew and we just locked ourselves in a cabin and taught each other stuff constantly every day not every day now probably every other day i go on a walk and i just call random people i'll just say yeah teach me something and i mean it's just you just have to have a never ending thirst for learning that's very imperative especially if you want like if you want to get on top and then stay on top the only way to do it is just to constantly be learning or someone who is learning is just gonna you know have a leg up on you in the knowledge game and what kind of stuff are you because you you you've talked about offline that you just love learning of all kinds it doesn't matter but in terms of videos are you studying videos are you studying recently not as much i'm more see because to get to the videos i want i have to build this business and scale up and higher so one of my recent time has been like my teenage years were spent studying virality and studying content creation now i'm studying how to build a content company so i can actually produce the crazy ideas i wanna produce if that makes any sense so yeah on that the business side we talked about hiring do you have trouble firing people no i'm pretty sure almost every person yeah actually every person i've ever fired we just give them severance and i like to see it more as it's no ill will like if if there's if like if i fired you if mhmm is there's some other job you want me to help you get i'll dm them on twitter like you know if you wanna go work for i don't know insert whatever mtv give me someone to dm i'll dm them like you know i i try to make it more like a transition and and do whatever we can to make it as easy as possible something was is not working for you because you you want people like you said super passionate because at the end of the day if you hold someone that you onto someone that you don't see being here in ten years you're just doing them a a disservice you're just giving them more ingrained more enrooted in where where they are and the sooner you do it and help them move on to their like new life the better given all the wisdom you have now if you were to give advice to somebody or if you were to start over again you had no money what would be the first ten videos you tried to to make on a new channel i guess that's advice for a new person and nobody knows you yeah and nobody knows me yeah habitat they have a mask on and you also i guess don't have the wisdom but if i don't have what i have in my head then i would say just fail like just a lot of people get analysis paralysis and they'll just sit there and they'll plan their first video for three months and yeah i'd i'm any of you listening if if you especially if you have zero videos on your channel your first video is not gonna get views period it's not your first ten are not gonna get views i can very confidently say that so stop sitting there and thinking for months and months on end and just get to work and start uploading like all you need to do this this applies to people who have not uploaded videos but have dreams of being a youtuber is make a hundred videos and improve something every time do that and then on your hundred and first video we'll start talking like maybe you can get some views but you know your first hundred are gonna suck there are very freak cases like liza koshy or emma chamberlain who have really good personalities and it doesn't take them so as many videos and it's just like people who are seven foot five and making the nba like yes there are free cases you can find but for the average person like us you know who don't have these exceptional personalities and you know backgrounds in filmmaking just make a hundred videos improve something each time and then talk to me on your hundred and first video well the improve something is time is the tricky one how do you improve something each time the second one just i don't know put more effort into the script the third one try to learn a new editing trick the fourth one try to figure out a way that you can have better inflections in your voice the fifth one try to you know study a new thumbnail tip and implement it the sixth one try to figure out a new title the the there's infinite ways that's the beauty of content creation online there's literally infinite ways from the coloring to the frame rate to the editing to the filming to the production to the jokes to the pacing to every little thing can be improved and they can never not be improved there's no less there's literally no such thing as a perfect video so if you knew everything you know now with no money step one would i just brainstorm like okay i don't have money what are some viral things like i mean the first thing that comes to mind is something as simple as when i count to a hundred thousand which is what i did do when i i was poor and like that worked but like what's something like that i could do that would be even more attention grabbing you were as part of the brainstorm you would throw out a lot of ideas and people throw out a bunch of ideas and one of the questions is is this even doable right first off come up with ideas you think would do well and then ask yourself later if they're doable yeah because there's there's different ways you can accomplish something don't be cynical about the doability of stuff yeah because there really are so many different ways you can accomplish a goal like when we give away an island like we give our hundred million subscriber an island yeah you know you can't find private islands that you know don't look like shit for less than ten million dollars so this isn't doable right alright the idea doesn't exist not doable exit off but then you know you dig into it and you you know find different alternatives and you find okay what if we just buy a two million dollar island that sucks and then spend a million dollars you know importing some sand let's build a beach let's import three hundred trees let's put a little bit of canals let's cut some paths boom now it's a really nice island but it's actually affordable because we don't have ten million dollars to spend on a video but we can afford to spend three and a half and lose whatever million dollars on that video so like that's an example of like yeah if you just went off the gut test you're like this isn't doable you know every island's ten million dollars we're we're screwed like if we go cheaper it's just a terrible island no and so if you like there are so many different ways you can achieve what you want you really gotta push through notes which not a lot of people do you have to have like a more of a dominant personality and just a willingness to when people tell you it's not possible just actually go through all the variables and eliminate them all yourself have a stubbornness and a resilience to failure maybe for what we do and creators online it's very imperative that you have that a no isn't a no to you you really have to like think and and just like we we take a personality test and like just having a a dominant personality is a better indicator that when someone tells you oh there's no way you're gonna build a brick wall for under a hundred grand you know you'll be like okay and then still go check the next ten vendors and yeah you know figure it out yeah what advice would you give to an already established channel like with one two three four million subscribers how to like ten x it like increase it without losing major yeah that's where it's very like channel by channel you can't give general advice okay yeah because if i do millions of creators are gonna see this and then they're gonna do it and i'm gonna fuck them over you know i see i see so let's say i'd like two million subscribers on this podcast yep like how would you ten x that without sacrificing what it is ten x your stuff does it matter so we you've talked about with success yeah that it's it's different for everyone like is ten x ing your definition of success no well then it's gonna right off the bat it's hard because if you don't give a shit about ten x ing it's even harder to ten x he does this because he likes helping people that's one thing i've found throughout this day every time i talk data it's so funny with him because it's like you know you could do this to get more views and he'll just be like blank i'll be like that doesn't register anything and he's just like doesn't care which is it's really cool nervous about that i'm really nervous about the numbers affecting because it's so fun oh yeah it's so fun to focus on the numbers and i'm i'm i'm really worried about that but at the same time you should be cognizant of that because you've created not just some of the most watched videos but some of the most amazing videos ever so it's there's a strong correlation there it's not like you're selling your soul to make a highly viewed video it's actually if you look at the metrics it helps you understand what is compelling and not and so i feel like i am i i feel like there's some value to investigate what work when people tune on and when not yeah to be date more data driven even on podcasts but i'm really afraid of that on the flip side i think part of the appeal is that you don't care about that kind of stuff but there there could be stuff that doesn't have to do anything with that and has to do with stylistic choices of lighting and cameras or maybe with for example topics yep you know like even what you've asked me here is like different than what most people ask me yeah so it could be the i mean and and it'd be nice to understand that but yeah again i'm worried about polluting the at the end of the day it's it's this is a true case of it's your own intuition like you know your viewers better than anyone else what it's whatever see i'd like to push back on that i really don't you do i do name one person who knows your viewers better than you somebody that looks at numbers of podcasts no you know your viewers you know you're the only how many episodes have you done three fifty exactly but i'm not paying attention you're the only one who's watched every second of all three hundred and fifty of them probably that's just that's just not no i haven't but the the because well because you did it so you do know what's in the album it's sure your content is new people i'm telling you you do and this is just one of those moments where you're an intelligent guy and you just have to trust your like instincts like just think what is the typical ex viewer and what do they want i don't think like that my tip but that's all you would have to do and whatever your gut tells you that would be the best guess you don't know what the typical viewer is though i don't i don't because i to investigate that would be very very difficult and then you have to start looking at the numbers you have to start to like consider the demographics the only way i know that anybody even watches it is because i'll sometimes run into people like when i run along the river and they'd be like i love you lex it's like okay well that that's a that's a data point and they're like cool people but you know i don't know any like i don't have any other it's difficult man it's difficult to know it's difficult to know who listens to boxes it's difficult to do you have a sense of who's i mean like you're so huge that everybody watches yeah but no i still do i'd say if you were to just put a gun to my head and you're you're like alright we're gonna pick a random person that watched your last video and you have to like roughly guess what they are and if you're not close we'll kill you i would say probably like a teenager that plays video games like some some like that would be probably the typical one and and then there are people that are maybe a little bit younger a lot of people are are older as well but in a ramble random sample size yeah it's probably like a a male boy that plays video games like that's the best way i would describe it but i don't try to pertain to them i just make whatever i think is interesting and good content and this this is what we were talking about before even though hypothetically thirty five to forty percent of my audience is women which is you know less than a majority if we get a hundred million views a video that's still thirty to forty million females that watch every video which is probably the largest you know views per video for for women on the whole platform which you wouldn't think that you know like i can't think of a single other creator that gets more women to watch their videos than that and so it's just anything even like people above the age of thirty even if it's only like three or four percent that's still three to four percent of a hundred billion views is a lot of people that age so we we hit a large group of of kinda every demographic if that makes any sense so what what if we look at other maybe more challenging kinds of channels or not but if we look at educational for example like lectures or if we look yeah educational it could be short videos like how would you ten x that like something on robotics on biology on science on engineering on all all of that that's more educational focused we would honestly just have to pull the because it's the same way as if you went to gordon ramsay you said how would a new cook cook better you know it's like oh shit even then that's not even specific you have to go channel by channel you really do or i'm i'm giving horrible advice because if there was these just golden rules everyone would do it you know what i mean like if there's these magical little principles how quickly when you look at a channel can you kinda very give advice yeah it's it's like service love at the start and then the more if we watch ten videos i feel like i would have a good profile and i could tell you in my opinion you know when especially once i look at the analytics and i get more ingrained in like okay the typical viewer is this they're from here here's how they're feeling you know because there are people who make videos for rednecks it's like the rednecks taste of content is just so much different than obviously women watching makeup videos which are so much different than you know teenage boys watching a minecraft video they're just all different so the biggest thing you have to do is put your heads your head in the headspace of the viewer and see the content how they would because if you just try to only give your taste which is what a lot of people do and things from your perspective it's very biased and it's just not gonna work for everyone and that's actually how you do more harm than good which is something i'm very careful of yeah but at the same time it's just generating a lot of ideas i think the first time i've talked to you was on clubhouse actually yeah and i mentioned something about robots and like almost immediately went to generating a bunch of ideas around robots it's just a hundred robots versus a hundred humans yeah i'll market a robot throw a potato i think your idea like the first idea was because you just said so many ideas i never even thought of but it's it's it's it shows the value of basically brainstorming with people that think differently but at the end of the day my ideas are probably you know might lean towards some people a little bit younger than your audience like some of the stuff i've yeah there's still ideas like i think the first one you said because we're talking about quadruped like robot dogs you said to replace a biological dog with a robot dog and see if the owner notices something they you were just quickly brainstorming different ideas of like how this was years ago i remember that yeah which is just i mean it's like oh yeah i never really thought about that kind of so it's the basic the tension between what does it take for a robot and our ai system to replace the the biological systems that we the biological creatures that we we love in our lives yeah and but like that was like the the pace of idea generation was the thing that struck me today and in general it's like that's how you get at good videos is you keep keep the it makes it's much easier to make a video around a good idea obviously than a a bad one like you you just send yourself up for success okay so that's for ten x ing already popular channel what's the hardest number you said the numbers that matters click through rate average view duration and and surveys what's the hardest number to optimize for probably surveys you know do you have any do you have any insight into the surveys at all no not really but if you just click on a bunch of random videos online you'll eventually get a survey was this video transformative heartwarming inspiring what people rate does make a difference and it's like you can get people to click a video you can get them to watch it but you can't really fake whether or not they're satisfied like yeah they they don't lie the surveys you know you know maybe one person here and there might troll but once you aggregate enough it's a pretty clear telltale of the video so either you're making a great video or you're not what is it minimizing the non regrettability yeah i think elon tweeted that that's what he's tried to do on twitter twitter and that's interesting that's that's basically the survey metric how happy you are that you've been using the platform yeah elon tweeted we wanna limit the amount of regrettable minutes people spend on twitter and the first thing i thought is like that's something youtube already has a lot like their whole survey system and feedback loop how tough is it to take on youtube you think like for twitter yeah for twitter for anybody else i mean it's gonna be basically impossible i mean youtube's not going anywhere and i i don't know i don't i don't think anyone's gonna do what youtube does better than them at least not in the next ten years you asked on twitter would you rather have ten million dollars or ten million subscribers on youtube what would your own answer be at various stages in your career if if if i had nothing i would say ten million dollars so because with ten million dollars you can hire some people and pump out content with like a million or two get ten million subscribers and then keep the other eight million so that's if you believe in your ability to grow a channel if you well if you'd yeah if you don't believe in your ability to grow a channel then you shouldn't take the ten million subscribers because you're just gonna kill the channel yeah you gotta kill it the ten million is definitely a better question would be would you rather have a million dollars or ten million subscribers that's where it gets a little tricky because now it's like you know a million dollars is life changing amount of money but you know if you semi know what you're doing you probably make a million dollars off of ten million subscriber channel but there is a little bit of risk a million dollars might not be enough to to build a strong team because you don't know how to do it so you might waste all of that money or they just keep it and retire yeah okay that's true yeah because ten million is just so high it's like just never work again who cares for the average human that's so much money it's interesting to me also to the value of the subscriber versus the value of the dollar i suppose how valuable is the subscriber for like what percentage of the videos like how active the subscribers in watching the video for you that's hard i don't know i was actually thinking more about the subscribers a dollar like if someone has ten million subscribers have they made ten million dollars i don't i don't know why that that kinda popped in my head it's an interesting thought do you ever when you analyze videos do you ever analyze videos like we we've talked about offline of other videos across youtube in general just to understand trends to understand social media and all that stuff all your not all but a lot of the questions are analytics based yeah yeah it's so fun love it i mean it's just a giant social experiment right like what people like to watch what people share yeah it's like a fascinating so i think the so back like i said before what percentage of your audience do you think care about this kind of stuff like this deeply about youtube analytics i think a large amount care about curiosity and exploration of interesting ideas and so in that sense fit it yeah yeah this would this would fit it i love it this is funny and this isn't me like trying to make i i love you and i actually i love your magnus one and and even your hikaru one was really good a bunch of other ones but i think we're getting to the point now where only analytics junkies would want to keep hearing more analytics talk and the normie is probably like they've had their dose of youtube talk for the next three years maybe i'm wrong hey comment if i'm wrong i could be i don't know your audience see this is where you would tell me shut up i know my audience you dumbass and i don't at all i actually i just follow the thread of curiosity and i think there's just a lot of curious humans in the world and and to me it's like so the question about analytics is the question of basically stepping away stepping outside of yourself and thinking why the hell do i like tiktok so much why do i like twitter so much why do i like youtube so much and getting even if you're not a creator getting an insight into that is really interesting it's like what because because all these platforms are fundamentally changing the nature of content people are reading books less they're probably going to be watching movies less and less they're probably going to be watching netflix less and less do you ever think about the the sort of the darker side of youtube and with shadow banning and censorship and all that kind of topics especially if you see it on other platforms like twitter that yeah that elon recently highlighted the shadow banning that was happening and in general the censorship that was happening on those platforms do you think about the role of centralized control of which information isn't or isn't made available through search and discovery i'll be honest i never really think about it so you just you just try to make fun videos that yeah i'm more i'm kinda more in my own lane but it's not like that i don't just specifically think about i i just like a lot of stuff in general like i'm just kinda in my own lane thinking about my own stuff but you know now that you asked i'm curious what what are your thoughts on on youtube and that kind of stuff well i i'm generally against centralized censorship or shadow banning shadow banning is the worst one because not that the goal of creating a healthy platform where you're having great conversations and videos that are not spreading misinformation that sounds like an admirable goal but that's too difficult of a job for a centralized entity that's too big of an a yeah and when there there's the misinformation stuff and then there's also just like the videos where they do something that causes what what happened back the the or apocalypse you know and a lot of creators revenue plummets because people are are doing videos that advertisers don't deem acceptable and then now all these big advertisers are pulling and the little guys are getting hit and because ad rates dropped by thirty percent and the person who just quit his job to go full time contribution mhmm now can't sustain it so it's also it's like a lot of different variables as well that makes it so complicated well i think the big thing is transparency especially around shadow banning for for people i agree on shadow banning you should be transparent you should let people know it it you know obviously there has to be some type of controls people can't just post whatever and so if you're pulling those levers they should at least know yeah so they know how how to improve their content they can understand it they can exactly if it if it's a wrong shadow banning like as a society that we should not shadow ban this kind of content that means exactly you should be publicly discussing it and have it not and if it's not not known then it's just kinda like well then who's pulling the strings and like you know how do we know they're not just manipulating things to get whatever message they want out there and silence other ones yeah and there could be sort of in the background government influence which is where actual freedom of speech comes into play that government should not have any control or be able to put pressure on censorship of speech and it gets weird if none of that is being there's no transparency around it that's a but to be fair that's a huge responsibility the amount of content that youtube is uploaded on youtube is shared by youtube viewed by you but even more of a reason why it it would probably make sense to be transparent you know yeah because then people can help fact check it that's right but that that requires building a platform that makes that easy right like to to make fact checking easy to make the like what twitter now has like being able to share context and all that kind of stuff that crowdsource it crowdsource it the way wikipedia crowdsource it i mean there's it's right and then you open a random wikipedia article but like you know people criticize wikipedia because there is a political lean to the editors of wikipedia and then they get there's some articles that definitely have a bias to them and all that kinda stuff it's a it's a difficult problem it's a difficult problem to solve that ultimately as much as possible it would be nice for the viewer to have control of that versus the the entity that's hosting it so for the viewer to decide figure that stuff out yeah this i'm just gonna make fun cool videos yeah yeah yeah you know let's go to antarctica again how was that how was it going you just came back from antarctica that i i watched the video that was that was fun that was a really fun video thank you there's i mean there's a lot of things i can comment about that but what was that what was the hardest part of making that video the hardest part was just getting out there it's just so remote and you know you you land the plane on just this ice runway and it's so sketchy and then once the plane takes off you're just there you're the most remote place in the planet and it's it's just it's very breathtaking i don't if you have the chance to ever go to antarctica i would recommend it it was probably like the in the video we climbed a mountain that wasn't named so we can name it and like standing on top of that mountain and just seeing hailing nothing and because once you get outside the outskirts and you get deep in antarctica there's no penguins nothing lives there at all and so there's just nothing in every direction it's just snow and these crazy beautiful mountains and some of them stick into the clouds and it was and the if you go during summertime the sun never goes down so the sun's up twenty four seven and it's just like spinning in circles at the top of the planet or whatever it looks like the top yeah you guys come with this several times how beautiful it is and so it's just yeah it's just very beautiful what about shooting itself like the technical aspects of shooting it oh i mean well so for the somehow we lucked out one of the days is like the warmest day in like forever that's been in antarctica it's like it was positive degrees but at certain parts it's also like negative twenty negative thirty and that's where the cameras you constantly have to be switching out the batteries and heating them up and like putting them basically in like your pants so they'll just get way too cold and we were prepared for much worse but it ended up being much better than we thought so so for that video but in general maybe some other challenging videos how does how do you go from the idea stage to the actual execution to the final video what's can you take me through like a full process of like we're we're talking to about some crazy wild ideas today how do you go from that to a final video where you click publish well i mean obviously first things first you gotta figure out the idea and then it just depends i mean pick any video you can think of on my channel i can take you through it well what about the in a circle you have to stay in a circle for for a hundred a hundred days yeah so for that one step one one of the most popular yeah that that video did really well yeah so we problem is we have to this is where you get really into the nuances of the company because we have a lot of videos going out you can't just in a vacuum be like alright we're not doing anything for a hundred days we're only filming this mhmm so step one is we had build an independent crew that could actually do that for a hundred days that way everyone else could keep working on the normal videos and not just screw everything up yep so step one you build that team okay we got the team now what do we need well to do this we need probably like ten cameras at least rolling at all times so we're probably gonna need to get a trailer and hook up a bunch of storage and stuff to just carry the sheer volume of footage we're gonna have and so get a trailer set up the cameras go out in the field paint a circle now we need a house go buy a house bring it out there and then it's like oh wait i think it'd be funny if i brought the house in on the intro yeah you know find a crane that can lift up a house so i can drive it in and drop it in the intro and that's like an iterative process where you're like okay this will be funnier so this is not all upfront that it's written it's like your i feel it would be but as you kinda see things you you get inspired and then you think of more and more and then this would be better with a crane yeah it'd be better if i dropped out of the house drop it yeah that was crazy that you decided to do that so fearless in the kind of crazy stuff you're willing to do exactly what i'm a broken record but whatever makes the best video possible yeah that's that's all you you focus on okay so what about the delegation of like who gets to what are the cameramen like the people operating the cameras what who's responsible for different things is it like a distributed process like how do that's where whoever the lead cam would be on that video would just decide it that one because we shot over a hundred days we didn't a lot of it was just sean and the guy who was in the circle just vlogging we just came with my camera yeah and he figured it out and then we'd have like for him just set hours each day that a camera would come so if he had any content he needed extra hands instead of just having someone on standby twenty four seven it made more sense to do set hours nice and yeah it was it was hard but you know explaining it in hindsight it sounds so simple you know and i i guess like the more because that one is relatively simple i guess because it's a low number of people yeah the hard part about that is just the time like you know i checked in on them so many different days and it's like an hour here two hours there two hours there over a hundred days adds up to be a ton of time and and even then like you know if you have a ten person crew you know paying them daily rates for a hundred days it just all that adds up what about like the hundred versus hundred hundred adults versus hundred kids what was the what was bringing that to life that seems like exceptionally challenging yeah basically the thought process was we did a hundred kids verse or sorry a hundred boys versus a hundred girls yeah people loved it honestly i didn't think they'd like it as much as they did video did really really well so the second i saw that video was crushing i was like alright we're doing it again but last time we did it we did it in our studio so we built a a giant room put a hundred girls in it sounds bad when i explain it like this and then a giant room put a hundred boys yeah and we're like after a hundred hours whichever room has the most people we'll give them half a million dollars so did well so we're like alright we're gonna do it again so we threw out all these different ideas it was like hundred football players versus a hundred cheerleaders hundred this hundred that hundred prisoners versus a hundred cops just craziest ideas and we settled on hundred kids versus a hundred adults and then the next step was like how do we make it better the kids versus adults are the sorry the boys versus girls the first one we did was inside the problem was every time it was night when we did these long time lapses you couldn't see the sun go up and down so we're like okay this time i wanna do it outside so the cubes are outside and instead of doing circles we wanna make them cubes and then you know i was figuring out do we want the yeah just just those videos came up at least today as ones that are like really complicated in terms of the audio in terms of how how it's to film it yeah that's the problem we had a lot of audio issues because in the first one we didn't have a roof on it the second one there was a roof so there's a lot of reverb which then in editing made it brutal like half the shots weren't usable and it really screwed us over so we had to do a lot of frankenstein in the editing to make up for basically my ignorance so you mentioned that you were surprised how well that that that one did a lot of creators talk about getting depressed when the videos don't do as well as they kind of expected there's a kind of feeling you can get really worn out by that do yeah i mean do your yourself feel that and also do you have advice for others that feel this yeah it's weird because i am a numbers guy but also it it used to it used to very much especially when i was like betting everything i had on a video when it did bad i was devastated man i'd i'd cry and i'd be depressed for days and it really would have a severe impact on my mood but i don't know now it doesn't really matter it's for video that's bad i just look at it i'm like oh why is this video too bad probably oh there's a little retention dip there i don't think people like the thumbnail maybe we should switch it i just look at it objectively unemotional and then just move on and i feel like that's a much healthier way of going about it so if a creator is listening like that is the ideal way to respond to a video that's doing bad just remove emotion from the equation and just look at it and figure out how you can improve the next one is there tricks to being able to detach yourself from the from that because because like in your case i mean that's true for creators but in your case there's there's like a lot of money on the line yeah well there's videos cost a lot live yeah so much time but no i mean you just i mean i don't know the only real answer is it's just a conscious effort you just have to unemotionally look at the video determine the problems and then move on like there there is no secret you know what i mean it's just that's it's that and if you really can't bring yourself to do it then you're just screwed honestly maybe you're not meant for this game okay so that's part of the development as a creator is like you're being able to be a for longevity yes yeah you have to unemotionally be able to look at videos that flop and figure it out because if not just can you can and not every video can be a one out of ten and so when a video does bad you know that that just stress and depression is just gonna eventually get to you in the long run so you said you've failed in a bunch of videos sort of taking them to completion so what are some of the biggest fails yeah weirdly enough as we've matured and we've done this more we don't have that problem as much especially now that we're getting into the multimillion dollar budgets per video it's like failure is not really an option anymore so i'm a little more particular about what i do but back in the day yeah like we would do a video where we spent twenty four hours on a dessert island and we filmed it did it all and i just i didn't like it after the edit so i just grabbed the voice and we went back to the deserted island and spent another twenty four hours there and refilmed it or could that have been caught and prevented at the idea stage like where like no it's a good idea it was just poor execution to be honest when we were out there it was hot we're we're just like we all at one point just kinda wanted to die it was just miserable so how do we how do you avoid that these days well i just was a little cooler to be honest and then we had literally the amount of fun we had in the video was like ten times higher oh interesting so you like there's some practical details that you just learned yeah i know takes to achieve that where it's very hot or or it's on water because i get super seasick it was like a kinda like ten things that if they have these variables i'm down to do it but my fun meter is not as high as normal like we tried to anytime we we do anything on a boat like when we spent twenty four hours in pyramid or triangle or when i tried to spend like which it didn't get uploaded but i tried to spend like a hundred hours at sea or whatever just like on a raft it just like i it makes me wanna throw up and i get so seasick i can't even see straight but there are just some videos that require me to be on a boat so i just suck it up so when you spend months in creating a video i i know this is probably stressful to some creators like how much stress how do you feel when you have to click publish video now not much are you able to detach yourself yeah again in old me tons i mean i'd be like scratching and nervous and like my hands will be sweating like to a point where i'm almost about to puke i'm like i really hope people like this but you know i don't know i think that's just part of maturing it there's different and as a content creator there's different phases and you just like once you get over the the fear that you're just gonna wake up one day and be irrelevant you know and you just you know accept that like you believe in yourself and you believe in your content and that you can continue to be relevant then you don't i don't know you kinda are it's a little bit easier to attach yourself i guess and and that's i it's a much healthier place to be you can't do this for ten years if every little thing just causes these huge emotional reactions it's like that's why a lot of creators go a little you know mentally insane you know you have to get out of that that game right because it really messes with you we've talked about this a little bit but how do you define and how do you suggest others define success it's i i need to subjective some some people success is retiring their mom you know for you success is inspiring people and yeah educating them and you know whatever the piquing their curiosity for other people it's just quitting their job so you have to self reflect on what your definition of success is because i think a lot of creators kinda don't really think don't introspect mhmm like they kinda wanna keep getting more and more subscribers kinda thing i'm yeah but subscribers is just a vanity metric you know it doesn't subscribers don't correlate to views sure or views what yeah i know but that's more that was a direct view that was more directed to people listening because a lot of people do really care about subscribers or even followers like on tiktok but if you look like your view if on youtube very very few percent if even a percent of your views come from the sub feed right they're almost all home feeder suggested when's the last time you clicked on your sub feed to watch a video oh almost never yeah yeah maybe five years ago it used to be a thing it's not anymore no one does and it's getting harder and harder to find this out i subscribe to way too many channels i think yeah that's what everyone does and you subscribe to ten channels they're great but two years later your taste evolves and it's like it's a mess and so this subscribers don't really matter followers on tiktok don't really matter so anyways it it real they really are the definition of a vanity metric and but what about views they do obviously because if people are showing up time and time again that's what matters okay so that that's a good thing to define a success i i just feel like that too can be a problem because i would say you know if i wanted to be successful like as a young creator i might start copying mister beast or something like that right yeah like there's you you start trying to take shortcuts as as opposed to find your your own unique voice right so like chasing views is a problem too it feels like oh no as as long as you detach yourself from that i mean if you're sounds bad but if you're lazy yeah and you just wanna copy someone else and not experiment and find your own way but yeah yeah i mean you can't make that excuse for them if someone just isn't coming up with original stuff and putting in the effort you can't just say oh it's because they're chasing views and we need some match different metric for them to chase no they just need to find their own way i mean it just feels like unique type of content will often lead to sacrifice in the number of views in the short term mhmm and by the long term you win okay or if you do win you you win more i guess would be a better way of putting it do you think you will ipo miss mister beezburger or feastables in the next five ten years beezburger or feastables no i i kinda think they're something actually you know what i just realized yes this is our first time talking about those we're like an hour and a half in that's so funny we started talking about what my my retention brain kicked in i wonder if you have retention brain for like life itself oh i do every time i'm talking to someone i can i'm like okay i wonder like loved ones like spending time with loved ones thinking like we could be doing something much better right now yes no that is a serious problem with well well so we'll pause the beast for your question yes but that's why my current girlfriend which i was telling you before when we were talking about this is she has a genuine love for learning and that's something i have like i i always feel like i need to be learning something to justify the time i'm spending and so that's why it's such a nice trait because i feel like the time is being used optimally because whether we're watching a documentary or we're going in in you know taking iq tests or reading about whatever just why modern art is a thing i don't know whatever weird thing we decide to do i'm always learning and improving so it justifies the time so to maximize retention in your relationship yeah you you wanna spend time that time learning as much as possible yeah which conveniently i don't have to force right yes or or i wanna be recharging so i when i do work i can you know hit the ground harder and luckily we're into a lot of the same things which you know happen to be learning and sometimes it's not learning like maybe watching an anime or something like that but i'm a big believer in you're either if you well if you if your goal is to be like a super successful entrepreneur you need to either be working or you need to be doing something that decompresses and recharges you so you can work again if your goal is to be like a really kick ass entrepreneur and obviously we're pulling this down to like a very basic thing and so the the things you're doing your doubt time when you're not working if it doesn't recharge you you're screwed you're just a ticking time bomb waiting to implode and so you gotta like heavily recharge and like so like watching for me anime or whatever it is playing a board game like that is actually kinda crucial to my success which takes a lot of maturing to come to that conclusion because i used to be the kind of guy that wanted to work every hour of the day and i would try to train myself to not need that stuff and i you know and i almost resented like that i i have to do these kinds of things and it would piss me off because it's not optimal and you know i just really wanna make content and entertain people but yeah as someone who's gone down that road and you know you just work every day for two three months straight and you know every hour of the day and then it's just a bomb waiting to explode and lose your mind and the only real sustainable thing is to just like give yourself time to recharge in between working so there's a kind of balance you have to find you have to even and i hate it more than anyone else because i you know you hate not working yes because it's just not optimal for time like it's it's it's as a human i do need to occasionally watch a mindless show and play a board game yeah and it took me a very long time to like come to peace with that and not i would have like borderline panic attacks when i do it because i'm like i just what am i doing right now why am i doing this i should be you know like what if one day i have to lay off an employee because we're not doing so well like how could i justify watching this this show or whatever i'm doing right now you know it's like there's a lot of things like that that go on in your head but it's necessary before we return to mister beast burger what is like a since we're on the topic what is a perfect day in the life perfectly productive day in the life of mister beast look like oh boy well i mean or or like a standard the perfectly productive day is we film my main channel video like because those get a hundred million a pop i mean it doesn't really get any better than that what about like the average day when you're not on the set yeah and you're like pull it like because because you're running a lot of things right yeah so right now we have our staff brand feastables we have a restaurant chain beast burger and then we basically which we haven't even really launched any products yet but we have the the data company that i was showing you where we're gonna roll out some tools for creators and then we have the react channel the gaming channel the main channel and then we have my charity which also has a channel and so kinda how i've structured my life right now is whenever i have free time we just kinda go hey guys jimmy's got an hour from two pm to three pm and it's everyone's just like i need this i need this and this channel's like i need this thing filmed or you know whatever the guy who runs my tiktok is like i need this tiktok filmed or you know beast burger is like i need this menu item approved do we need to talk about this marketing thing and then we kinda just look at what everyone needs and we're like that one looks like the most important we'll do that and then so it's just kinda like you know if i just did that for every company in a day then that's optimal if i just kinda like an optimal day for me would be going down to eight companies and just whatever their like two to three biggest pain points or things they need from me and just doing those based on priority and then trying to keep it as short as possible yeah to just the things that you needed on it it doesn't get more optimal than that if i clear the bottlenecks or some bottlenecks for all my companies then it's yes that's a perfect day yeah i mean even just me because you're like you're showing me around and you're being a a great and gracious host but on top of that you're just doing all these meetings you you basically i felt bad at some point so i was like oh i just tricked him into going to meetings with me he's like my little meeting buddy yeah i mean it was it was it was fun it's fun to see it it was fun to see how effectively you've delegated you basically trust the team to do a really good job on the various things and there's just a a strong team that's able to carry the flag on all the different tasks yeah from the from the brainstorming in the main channel to the reacts and so on yeah it's really interesting i mean it's it's really interesting what it takes to build a team like that because you very quickly build the very large team that's that's able to scale which is very scary it says it's my first you know re i i'm twenty four you know and i i think i was telling you this earlier it's funny because six years ago i had to raise my hand to go use the bathroom and now i'm in charge of hundreds of people and entertain hundreds of millions of people and so it is crazy just how quick it comes up and i wish i was a little bit older so i could have ran a couple of companies and failed a few companies in the past and like learn from those and apply those here because i know for a fact when i'm thirty four i'm twenty four now when i'm thirty four i'll i'll know so much more about running a business and scaling and hiring and and how to lead people and better effectively communicate and all these different skill sets that will make me a better leader that that's the only thing that sucks is i just don't have those because i just haven't been through the lessons and i just have such a lucrative thing on my plate right now and it just sucks that i have to learn the lessons with the lucrative thing you know what i mean yeah because you you already have so much influence so much impact but you have effectively scaled what what what lessons do you draw from that how to effectively scale as as a twenty four year old like you yeah that's something i feel like i actually could give a lot of value to to young people who are doing it like older people who've built five companies or whatever they do i probably couldn't you know they're gonna be like oh this is so obvious but for younger first time business owners you gotta just experiment to be honest and but for us like it's it's just a new space no one had really ever scaled up a hundred person team to build make content on youtube mhmm so there wasn't no i spent all this time like i hired one person from disney to at one point to come in and and help and obviously that was a dumb idea looking back on it but you know i thought oh they make great stuff people wanna watch and they come over here and help me build a team and you know they build it more the traditional way and not like how it should be online and and so then it's like okay and now i'm not trying to trash people like they all tried their best but then i try hired this one person who run does this different type of media and runs a hundred person team and then you come in here and they try to build it that way they don't really listen to your value or or see the difference and i i tried basically for building this company with like four or five different people who worked in different veins of media and you know every single time it's just like they just don't get it and they like they don't understand my world and the the eventual solution was just like drop my sleeves and do it myself you know with like james or him man and just like no no one's ever done this and like no one's gonna just give us a golden carrot and tell us how to build this company we gotta figure it the fuck out ourselves and you have to kinda build up people from scratch then yeah exactly all the stuff i was talking about earlier and all the the lessons i learned along the way and so for me that was a big part of like stop trying to have someone build this company for me and just do it myself because it's scary like i spent my whole life studying youtube videos of virality not business building but fuck it i was like i guess we just gotta do it ourselves then and that's where things really started to click and we got the exponential growth we started getting the right people and training them the right way and you know just throwing conventional stuff out the door and focusing on what's actually practical for youtube which is just completely different than traditional media so you train people and then those people train people and then and so on yeah i mean it's just even like you know how you do the lighting on sets or like how how you do the audio or or you know not writing scripts so you know we're just not as efficient with our filming like sometimes i have to have thirty cameras running why because it's not scripted i don't i don't know what chris is gonna do when we start filming he might run over there but guess what we gotta have it planned because there's only one shot i can't you know tell him not to do that yeah that's the shooting but then there's also the editing yeah and then the editing as well and not having guardrails and kinda you know i at at the end of the day it's whatever i want the video the their job is to make a video that they think i'll like because it's my channel but you know you can achieve that kinda however and and so it's just everything's just different you know it's much more i guess like a start up as opposed to are you often surprised like with the result like you think a certain like we watched the video today that was really nice that was different than you would have potentially edited it yeah are you sometimes surprised by like a decision an editor makes it's like okay that's not the way i would have done it but it's actually this is a cool idea yeah of course yeah the the the thing my biggest fear is i don't ever wanna get trapped in like a bubble of you know because we are getting a hundred million views of video on the main channel like but i don't wanna get in this feedback loop of just my ideas are great or or like not feedback loop but stop learning and improving because it is easy sometimes to be like what we're doing is working we need to just keep doing it i wanna keep learning and trying new things and i guess one way i'd put it is like you don't when when you're on a a come up or you're growing you don't wanna test new things once you start to plateau or have a downtrend because if you're like you know you you're skyrocketing right you're up up up and then you level off you start to go down and you're like oh this isn't working anymore let's start experimenting well if you have a bad experiment now you're in like a tailspin you're nose diving and you have one more bad experiment you're like screwed kinda i'm oversimplifying you wanna test things while you're still growing to keep their growing from happening because once you like have you know again very oversimplifying that like you know kind of level off you do a couple tests and they go wrong am i you're like screwed you know what i mean you're already out the door now you're just confirming that you're out the door in online entertainment so that's kinda how i see it so i think it's very imperative that you're constantly always experimenting and trying things even if you're getting crazy unheard of growth and so that outside of the thing that brought you to the dance you just dived right into mister beast burger and feastables this is a whole another industry like what was that like well so beast burger we kind of it was supposed to be like just a pop up like we we just partnered with someone who had three hundred restaurants and we're just like you know let's let's just sell beef burgers for a day or two let's let's see what happens we didn't really think it would be as big as it was but those first like that first day you know we do six figures in sales and they all sell out and they're running to local walmart they can't keep up with the demand and it's like okay well maybe let's just leave it open a week whatever and we're just doing crazy revenue and it's like okay well let's add some more restaurants and let's just leave them open for a month and we're just still doing six figures a day and it kinda just went from this thing that was i don't know it wasn't really i didn't really plan on running a restaurant chain but here i am but did didn't that in some sense also open your mind to something like feastables feasible is something i've always wanted to do because i i think just in general american snacks are just full of so much horrible ingredients to be honest so they're not i don't know i feel like there also just hasn't been any innovation in american snacks in quite a while and so that's just something i've always been pretty passionate about the thing we built that from scratch so we hired a ceo and built a team around them and we we spent probably over two and a half years before we even launched just like building the right team figuring things out and making sure it was actually ran the way i wanted which feasibo has just been crushing it's it's very interesting this is something i've never talked about publicly but having products in retail it's like before feastables everything i had done was online so if you wanted to you know anything from the quote unquote piece brand you'd have to buy it online and ship it to you but feastables now that you know because our first product chocolate bars we started putting that in in retail locations so like for example walmart it's it's crazy like it's just it doesn't make sense how if you're which i guess it does for because we get a hundred million views of video so a lot of people know us if i go stand at walmart those people recognize me and ask for photos like if i still don't know enough i could take a hundred and fifty photos today in walmart or two hundred whatever it is so obviously it makes sense those people go find feastables but then you just multiply that by every walmart in america and it just gets so crazy and i i didn't think we'd be doing the kind of revenue we are and we're about to launch in some other i don't i don't know if i'm allowed to say it so whatever but yeah other big retail you know locations and convenience stores and like by the end of next year we could be in like forty fifty thousand locations and the numbers just don't make sense so you know what i mean what are some interesting challenges about scaling there that surprised you the biggest problem which i didn't think would be was just keeping the shelves in walmart stock to be honest like it it was so that is supply supply chain it was brutal or even then sometimes like you know you get them the stuff and they're like it takes them like a day or two to put it out in that specific location and i i had to stop promoting it because every time i'd mention it like forty percent of people would just be like it's not there it's not in walmart or i can't buy it and so there's like a three ish month period where i just didn't promote festivals because i was scared that someone would go buy it and this is not there and so like it took us a very long time to catch up to the demand and also it's not like we have unlimited money so i but now we're we're relatively caught up in keeping up but it's gonna be interesting because now this year in twenty twenty three we're gonna basically you know ten x the amount of locations we're in so we're and we're gonna try to launch new products so we're we're in for an interesting ride but yeah i just hate i hate when i tell people you know like hey go try this product and then they go in their local walmart and eventually other places and it's not there it's just so brutal you know they made that whole journey out there and they couldn't get it and so that that was really it besides that nuts it's been doing way better than i ever thought you've talked to a couple places about maybe doing mobile games or computer games in the future yeah is that something you're still considering yes because you know do you normally talk with people as much as we talked beforehand is that no no that that that was we spent all day today talking about my head everything you asked me is something we already talked about not really is that no no not everything i take it back but sorry the last two questions yes and so it's just funny because what no i try it's okay there's a there's a different style of asking those questions because i i on purpose didn't dig further with you i could tell yeah direct so i could tell you okay this by the way okay alright alright well this is this is the first time i've ever talked to somebody as much as i did with you beforehand yeah well on the same day i know we did all day together we're talking about three hours hour yeah yeah or so yeah literally it's funny this is a hilarious and awesome social experiment i i picked him up from his hotel and i just like harassed him all day to hang out with me and then great here we are now i love it i love i was secretly recording the whole time just so you know i'm just kidding anyway so what was the question the blah blah blah blah the beast burger and feastables that there's physical goods as opposed to like making mobile games or or pc game whichever one we end up doing which is software and i actually have a giant international audience like most of my audience is obviously outside of america and so the problem we're running into is it just takes time to build up the supply chain and get festivals in southeast asia get festivals in india get festivals in brazil and mexico and all these other places where we have giant pockets of our audience and same thing with beast burger it's just it's gonna take probably years unless we partner with someone who already has distribution which we're figuring out but the beauty of software is i can make a hypothetical game or whatever we end up doing and all my fans can you know use it tomorrow the day i mentioned it and so if i promote something in a video to a hundred million people and it's like a you know basically like a game they can all download it so the you know but if i promote a feastables bar right now it's only in america because we're we're struggling just to keep up with american demand we haven't even gotten the chance to go outside america so i i alienate a a majority of my audience and it feels so shitty to just you know mention something that most of them can't buy but on the flip side you can't just spawn this crazy infrastructure and just have tens of millions of bars and all your products in every single store across the world before you promote it so you can't put the egg before the chicken and so it's like that that's that's what i'm excited about i wanna get into less physical stuff and more stuff that everyone can actually use that's the thought process if there's a social element to the gaming too because it's not unlike feastables like that's a product you consume you missed it when you're setting up for this we were doing some basically just laying out every everything that we're planning for so we're at the phase where we wanna start hiring the team to build it and we're kinda just laying out the game and i was actually really curious to get your thoughts but i can't say it because whatever i say someone's just gonna take it and run with it but you you had a good idea all about the kind of games you're you're thinking about yeah i mean i can imagine we also talked a little bit about it yeah it's super awesome good ones i did so much good talks alright the juicy talks happened here she's like i gotta go set up well you know i i already heard a lot of awesome stuff i mean but that is a different kind of team you would need to hire yeah is that a little nerve wracking like going into a new field and trying to a little bit but then i remind myself like like steve jobs didn't know how to code right and you know he just he just knew what a good product was and i feel like as someone who wasted so much of his life playing video games i have a good sense of it and that might be ignorance well that that's really important right it's not about coding it's about what makes for a good game exactly and again that might genuinely be ignorance and maybe i end up you know getting being the butt because of what i'm saying now but i think just like with youtube i just wanna obsess over making a great product and things that i think my audience will love and i think as long as i keep that as my north star it'll do well what does the path to being worth a hundred billion look like does the path to being worth a hundred billion look like i don't know like because okay k let me just like pause here twenty four and there's so much awesome scaling so many great ideas do you you think about different trajectories yeah of what those possible trajectories might look like yeah i mean if the goal was to just be worth a hundred billion dollars yes i i'm my goal i'm a broken record it's to make the best deal possible because i know whatever else i want will come obviously so the the the video is the foundation yeah exactly so to path to a hundred million dollars is keep getting a hundred million views of video you know what i mean but or more oh yeah or more exactly if we can keep growing but you know if we can keep feasibles growing right and we eventually spend in international and one day we're in a hundred thousand retail locations and we're selling the same amount of skus per or units per skus like we're currently doing i mean that would crush and then obviously ideally one day we open up hundreds of beast burgers we get it where we turn out you know like super sell a couple hit games i don't wanna make dozens or hundreds of games i just wanna make games that are just great and you know we rarely drop them when we do they're bangers and just you know whatever other stuff we end up doing all that combined i mean it's just interesting because like what what's a show that's pulled a hundred million views per episode basically like like we're doing like you what i mean like the super bowl gets praised because they get a hundred million viewers but i can't think of a show maybe in reruns or something so but it's also a show that's has has a singular kinda ex figure yeah that you can now use as a like i don't have a network tell me what to do i don't have anyone like i can do whatever i want so it's a very interesting position because i put out content and a hundred million people show up and then i also have a gaming channel i put out content and fifteen million people show up and every action i put out content and ten million people show up i have a tiktok and i put out content and on average twenty million people show up and like and i so as long as i can keep that going and then we build these businesses it's like it's honestly pretty scary to see what will happen you know over the years because feastables launched you know last year twenty twenty two so it's a relatively new thing and beast burger we just started scaling up the physical side and we haven't obviously even launched any mobile games yet so i think i'm at the antithesis of it i don't see a world where my youtube channel is irrelevant in the next couple of years i just this is what i live for and so if i can keep that going and then really start to expand these businesses that leverage off of it then yeah i mean hopefully there's a day when or i could give away a billion dollars in a video honestly that that yeah that would be one hell of a video let me ask you the ridiculous question since you went from being broke to being rich although you keep spending all your money does money buy happiness how has money changed sort of your your contentment your happiness in life money by happiness no not i mean to a point yes once you can take care of your health you can take care of like any immediate dangers and you can take care of your family relatively no it doesn't like but those things do like when i first came into money one of the first things i did was retire my mom and like that brought me tons of happiness you know what i mean and like you know if my brother had a medical emergency and and we couldn't afford it and i made money to afford it that'd bring tons of happiness you know so once you take care of those basic necessities so we'll say make over hypothetically a million dollars no it it it really doesn't like adding an extra zero going from ten million to a hundred million or whatever it is makes no difference so you're given that or just fearless in spending the money yeah well let me reframe i guess it could for some people if if you really i don't know you spent your whole life obsessing over cars it probably would bring you a little bit of joy to buy a nice lamborghini i i'm coming more from the frame of mind of of an entrepreneur someone who's really obsessed with business building for me and a lot of my friends and people i hang around what brings us happiness is winning and building companies and do you know changing the world like that that is fun it's a complex problem you can wake up every day and it gives you something to obsess over and devote your life to whereas just having money doesn't you know well one interesting question i have for you psychologically so because you have become wealthy and because you give like part of your work is giving away a lot of money do you find it hard to find people you can trust is good question do do do do people see you basically as a source of money as as opposed to another human being it's weird because you would think yes but i i feel like i also know the right places to look but yeah if i just walked into target and tried to make friends with ten random people of course so you gotta so you can kinda sense oh yeah you can sense the right thing in the target yeah that's yeah it's so obvious so i don't even wanna go into descriptions but but honestly a lot of my friends are like chandler i i played little league with him and tyler the guy i mean i went to school with him chris he was my first subscriber carl was here after we got big but whatever he's friends with the boys and it is a lot of my closer friends even like my youtube friends i i knew before i was big so maybe there is some merit to that maybe it is i i don't know i've never really put too much thought into it maybe there's a reason i hang around a lot of these people i knew before i got paid because it's much easier and they help you keep like your radar sharp of who can and can't be trusted because you know you can trust them yeah it's difficult when you become richer and richer and more powerful well one thing you'll also find when you get rich i not even richer but more fame one thing i thought is as i climbed this like ladder of youtube and got bigger i thought there would be tons of people like me people i don't like that take like the kamikaze approach to building a business yeah you just throw all your money in it you throw all your time you throw all your energy you throw everything yeah you're just like fuck it this it's this i'm dead yeah i thought there would be hundreds of these yeah and and there isn't there isn't i mean there's like maybe one or two and i talk to those motherfuckers every single day i'm sick and tired of talking to them but i love them but it's just so interesting because like every level i got up like i get a million subscribers i'd be like alright where's all these guys and the million subscribers that are fucking psychopaths and then you know you know they're like people become con like conservative as they get like they get more especially as they get bigger yeah and you know twenty million subscribers thirty it's like every step of the way it's like i just got more and more lonely to be honest so if you you know it sounds cliche and you hear that kind of shit in movies and you're like oh that's not how it works but it is like there's there's just not many people that just wanna give up everything go all in then obsess over making the greatest goddamn videos every single day of their life like they're really hard to find and be able to sacrifice everything for that video yeah like basically you put all the money right back in yeah or the people doing it they're on just a small scale and if i talk to them it's just ninety nine point nine percent of the time i'm teaching them things and it's like so it's lonely because there's not too many people especially in the creative space that are as crazy as you yeah it is one hundred percent it's it's so it's not what i was expecting i was expecting there'd be a lot of people like me but well i guess the guy we talk to elon musk is a bit like you in that sense yeah just in a different domain yeah exactly just willingness to put it all back in right now why i've found right now a lot of the people i relate to don't even make youtube videos like they're just like i i'm veering more and more away from fellow content creators and more to just you know i'm just looking for those other people who just share a little bit of it so i don't feel so fucking crazy all the time like you know what i mean and like people i feel normal around they tend to just be doing the randomest things but you know loving it well i think that's really inspiring it's it's like the bukowski line find what you love and let it kill you is really put everything put everything into the thing you love and that that's like the way to really create special stuff but it's also the way to yeah like live all the life most for to be careful giving this advice because they're like they're like bodybuilders who'll be like just go to the gym be disciplined i'm disciplined go to gym but i would argue for those people it's like it's not even disciplined they just enjoy weightlifting right is it because there are people who are are jacked but they don't make much money or or run a business right if they're that disciplined they would they would be hitting every area of their life they just really like business and there's people like me who just to an extreme level love building companies right it's not even discipline for me it's just in my blood it's what i wake up i don't think about it i don't push myself i don't need to watch a fucking motivational video to go work i just do it it's programmed in me at this point and i i couldn't imagine a world where i don't wake up and do it every day but i think that a little bit of it is genetics and just how you're hardwired not that it can't be trained or taught and not that you know and obviously the friend group you're in influences these things and over time i think can change it but someone's just not gonna be able to flip a switch and then just start doing a kamikaze approach to building a business just like a lot of people try to flip a switch and start bodybuilding and then quit majority of the time you know it's just not innate to them but i think a lot of us have the capacity to do that in some domain yeah i think if you what about it strategically if you surrounded yourself with fellow like minded people and you know slowly over time switched it but if you just try to like hardcore do it you're just gonna lose your mind do you ever worry about your mental health did you take a step to protect it to yeah to like for the long run to make sure you have the mental strength to go on yes weirdly enough the best thing for my mental health was giving into my innate nature to work and the most depressed i get is when i try to restrict it and like i don't work weekends or i don't work this day what's best for me is just to work when i feel like working and then just not work when i don't like and just have no constraints because there are just some nights where i don't wanna sleep and for whatever reason i feel compelled to go all night whatever like just do it you know do whatever you want is what i tell my like working brain and i just give into it and i feel that's where i feel the happiest and and then you know it's typically like and when i'm really in the grind mode it'll be like seven or eight days just nonstop going going and then it's like i'll i'll realize like oh i need some recharge time and then go fucking binge a season of anime yeah it but and listen to your but that's the thing like people will tell you don't work weekends or don't do this or don't work past this or blah blah blah i'll give you all these constraints but for me and it's unconventional i just give into it i think there's something be really to be said for that i i i try to surround myself with people that like when i don't when i pull an all nighter they don't go like you should get more sleep there's a reason i pulled that all nighter like if i'm really passionate about something they say they basically encourage it because i i i have no problem getting sleep and getting rest what i need in my life is people that encourage you to kinda keep going keep going with the stuff you're passionate about normal people they don't want that life and they probably shouldn't it's not good for you but yeah is if you hang around people like just whatever different people you're gonna feel crazy and it's gonna wear on you whereas if you're around similar people it just it's so much easier like if you you know i've started weightlifting more and like one thing that's helped is just having jack people around me because they naturally just eat healthier they do like they naturally just have freaking grilled chicken and all this shit and high protein meals and it's just like easier for me to just piggyback and be like oh can you just order me whatever you're getting and they're like oh i gotta go to the gym and i'll be like oh shit i'll just join you you know and it's like it's just it's cheat codes you know what i mean just surround yourself with people that you wanna be and it makes it like seventy percent easier in my opinion it's like that is the cheat code to life and i wish i i obviously your audience is definitely a lot older but you know to the older people listening like if you have are in a place of mentorship for someone younger or have influence over younger people you should really try to drill that in their heads like the people they're around one hundred percent dictates the outcome i would yeah i would not be on a hundred and twenty million subscribers if if i didn't find when i was around a million i had a couple friends that were just also psychopaths you know i outgrew them but at the time it was great and i wouldn't be where i am today if it wasn't for them and just all along the way the friends that i hung out with had such a dramatic impact on on where i am like i i'd probably have eighty million less subscribers you know if it was if i wasn't so strategic about hanging out with people that i add value to and they also add value to me so the advice for young people would be to be very selective about the people you sign on so selective it's it's crazy like chris you know he's i i he's really funny and that's why he's great for the videos and part of why he's so funny is he consumes copious amounts of cartoons and just funny content and so i'll find like when i spend more time with chris i'll start just quoting these weird cartoons or shows and like my speech will literally change just after like a week of spending more time with him it has like it's like that quick of an effect you know now picture that over the course of years i mean yeah it has such a huge influence like pluck one of their friends out and hypothetically put me in there and you know there's no doubt if they're trying to become a content creator their odds of success is ten x right obviously you can't do that but you gotta find your your closest version of it and just be selective yeah but this also applies not just to younger to older people too agree but they it's it's even more i like when i was a teenager i just you know i couldn't relate to many people i just thought it was like a fucking freaking nature because no one was obsessed with building businesses or any of this kind of stuff and so like back then you know that advice would have been helpful maybe not that particularly but just knowing that there are you know it's not that you're a freaking nature you just haven't found people that have the same interest so the task is not to feel sorry for yourself or somehow change yourself it's more to find the people you fit in with yeah i mean yeah assuming which you know you you you're not getting confirmant like assume it's not something bad right like if your hobby is shooting things you know or shooting things you shouldn't be shooting you know don't find people that encourage that but outside of that for sure actually as an answer to what is the best advice someone ever gave you you said you're crazy until you're successful then you're a genius one hundred percent all along the way people gave me so much you know advice on why i shouldn't be doing it why i'm crazy every step of the way people wanted to tell me why i shouldn't be doing this and should get a life should stop being too obsessed everything everything under the book and then once i'm successful those same people are like dang you're you're a genius yeah wow you you really you you pulled that off those are probably the same people that will give you advice now you're the most successful video creator of all time stick to that anytime you wanna do something new right yeah they'll they'll like pressure you not to do you know feastables or or mobile gaming or whatever lays beyond yeah it's it's funny how people don't well honestly they're the type of you guys don't talk to anymore yeah sure i wouldn't even know what they have to say now so most people on the team are like yes and they're like whatever the idea you got they they're with it no i believe that it's weird we actually have a my team pushes back on me pretty hardcore oh they do which i want i don't want yesmed and yeah they're they're like they're james you know the ceo who helped me build all this he's very adamant like we're not yes men and and he trains people to really think for themselves and even when i give them orders like really think like is this optimal is there context or information jimmy could be missing that i could provide that could help them make a more updated decision like i'm not god you know what i mean like i'm human i make errors and so don't take what i say as the bible so even like in the brainstorming and so on they they can they can push back yeah you can see it like tyler anytime i said something he would give me feedback and push back which is what i want i don't want him to just be like yes you're a fucking genius good job jimmy you know i don't need that you know i need negatives you talked about being in a relationship what role jimmy does love play in the human condition i think well the role is well big thing is it's love can be scary because this is you know the human you're gonna spend the most amount of time with in your life you know and so for a project that over fifty years they can be a liability or an asset love the metrics you know i love no but seriously it's it's gotta be someone that makes you better for me i can't truly love someone that doesn't make me better because yeah in the long run yeah across across the because if not then it's like it's a negative you know to everything i've spent my life building yeah but luckily i'm very happy with the the partner i have and like we were talking about before i do think she makes me better there's a lot of actually positives i've noticed even things as simple as like you know i struggle to turn off my brain at night because i'm just thinking about all the businesses and how we could do better or whatever weird thing i have on my mind but you know just chatting with her and and hanging out with her helps me like basically just shut my brain off and like mellow out and even like there's just a ton of little things like that that i've noticed are are positives especially when you really look for them that are easy to gloss over if you're not and so for me yeah i i have someone who i think is very beautiful very intelligent makes me better is constantly pushing me okay with me working hard makes me smarter and just all these different things that i think for me love just makes me a better person you know what i mean which makes me love her even more does that make sense absolutely what advice would you give on finding somebody like that just really don't give up until you you find someone that you know there's so many people on the planet i mean there really is there there's billions of the odds are in your favor of yeah like just don't settle and find someone that you know makes you happy yeah just like you said surround yourself with people that that make you a better person in the same case surround yourself with that one special person that really makes you a better person and and for and maybe that's just an entrepreneurial brain looking at it i mean not everyone wants to hyperoptimize their life like me but for me to like truly love someone they have to make me a better person in every way yeah yeah well what do you hope you're twenty four we we started talking about death let's let's let's finish talking about death what do you hope your legacy is when you when we look a hundred years from now and the alien the ai has completely taken over and the aliens visit and discuss with the ai what this last of special humans that existed on earth was like what what do you hope they say about you it's a deep one probably just that because it's it's hard right like i said before elon is over double my age i could live every second i've lived up to this point in my life and still not even be elon's age so i have so much time i just hope whatever it is that it's a net positive on the world and it impacts billions of people in a positive way that makes lasting change so you admire people like steve jobs and elon musk for having sort of reached for that goal as well yeah of course to help to help millions i mean the iphone's the most successful product ever invented it's it's hard not to admire what he created you know what i mean the same with sort of as johnny ives talks about like the the passion the effort they put into the designing the iphone that like little bit of love is transferred to the whole world like they get to experience the joy of that from the designer it's what a beautiful thing to do you know what i mean i couldn't think of anything better you know to create something that even after you're dead for decades just has such a profound impact on basically half the human population yeah it's wild brings joy to people yeah well i hope you do just that man you've already done it for millions and millions and millions and millions of people and i hope you keep doing it i'm ex i can't like it's so exciting to see what happens this year and next year i know like the size is the limit yeah i i can't i mean the videos but every all the other businesses you're in and you as a human being as you grow yeah i can tell i know as everyone knows you have a kind heart and the fact that you're really damn good at actually using that kind heart to help a lot of people is awesome to see man i appreciate it more importantly before we go are we gonna play dune tonight some board
