fiona hill you came from humble beginning in a coal mining town in northeast england so what were some formative moments in your young life that made you the woman you are today well i was born in nineteen sixty five and it was the period where the whole coal sector in britain was in decline already and you know basically my father by the time i came along had lost his job multiple times every coal mine he worked in was closing down he was looking constantly for other work and he had no qualifications because at age fourteen he'd gone down the mines his father had gone down the mines at thirteen his great grandfather you know around the same kind of age i mean you had a lot of people you know at different points going down coal mines at twelve thirteen you know fourteen they didn't get educated beyond that period because the expectation was hey you're gonna go down the mine like everybody else in your family and then he didn't really have any other qualifications to you know basically find another job beyond something in manual labor so he worked in a steelworks that didn't work out a brickworks that closed down and then he went to work in the local hospital part of the national health service in the united kingdom as a porter an orderly so basically somebody's just pushing people around there was no opportunity to retrain so the big issue in my family was education you've gotta have one you know you've gotta have some qualifications the world is changing it's changing really quickly and for you to kinda keep up with it you're gonna have to get educated and find a way out of this and very early on my father had basically said to me there's nothing for you here you're gonna have to if you want to get ahead and he didn't have any kind of idea that as a girl i wouldn't i mean actually in many respects i think i benefited from being a girl mhmm rather than a boy there was no expectation that i would go into industry mhmm there was you know some kind of idea that maybe i you know if i got qualifications i could be a nurse my mother was a midwife and so she'd at age sixteen left school and gone to train as a nurse and then as a midwife i had other relatives who'd gone to teach in local schools and so there was an idea that you know women could get educated and there was a kind of a range of things that you could do but the expectation then was go out there do something with your life but also a sense that you'd probably have to leave so all of that was circling around me particularly in my teenage years as i mean i was trying to sort of find my way through life and looking forward first of all what does that even look like getting educated given the context of that place you don't know there's a whole world of mystery out there so so how do you figure out what to actually do out there but was there moments formative moments either challenging or just inspiring where you wondered about what you wanna be where you wanna go yeah there were i mean there were a number of things i mean i think like a lot of kids you know you you talk to people and particularly from blue collar backgrounds you say what did you wanna do boys might say i wanted to be a fireman you know or you got you know kind of at one point as a little girl i wanted to be a nurse and i had a little nurse's uniform like my mother i didn't really know what that meant but you know i used to go around pretending to be a nurse i even had a little magazine called nurse nancy and i used to read this and you know kind of that was one of the formative ideas it was a rural area semi rural area and i'd be out in the fields all the time and i'd watch farmers with their animals and i'd see vets coming along and you know watching people deal with the livestock and there was a kind of a famous story at the time about a vet called james herriot it became here in the united states as well and was a sort of tv miniseries he'd written a book and he was the vet for my one of my great aunt's dogs and people were always talking about him and i thought oh i could be a vet and then one day i saw one of the local vets with his hand up the backside of a cow in a field and he got his hand stuck and the cow was kicking him and i thought yeah maybe maybe not actually no i i don't think i want to be a vet so i cycled through all of these things about okay i could get an education but the whole sense was you have to apply your education it wasn't an education for education's sake it was an education to do something and when i was about fourteen or fifteen my local member of parliament came to the school and it was one of these you know pep talks for kids in these you know deprived areas he had been quite prominent in local education and now he was a member of parliament he himself had come from a really hard scrabble background and had risen up through education he'd even gone to oxford and done philosophy politics and economics and he basically told my class even though it was highly unlikely any of us were really gonna get ahead and go to elite institutions look you can get an education you don't have to be held back by your circumstances but if you do get an education it's a privilege and you need to do something with it so then i'm thinking well what could i do okay an education is a qualification it's to do something most people around me i didn't i knew didn't have careers i mean my dad didn't really have a career he had jobs my mom you know thought of her nursing as a career though and it genuinely was and she was out there trying to help women survive childbirth my mother had these horrific stories you know basically over the dining room table i wish she'd stop she'd leave out her nursing books and i tell you if everyone had had my mum as a as a mother there'd be no there'd be no reproduction on the planet it was just these grim horrific stories of breech births and fistulas and all kinds of horrors that my sister and i would just go oh my god you know what please stop so i thought well you know i don't necessarily wanna go in that in that direction but it was the timing that really cinched things for me i was very lucky that the region that i grew up county durham despite the massive decline deindustrialization and the complete collapse of the local government system around but you still maintain money for education and they also paid for exchanges and we had exchange programs with cities in germany and france also in russia in kostroma near yaroslavl for example an old textile town similar you know down in its kind of region but quite historic in the russian context in fact the original birthplace of the romanov dynasty in kostroma just as county durham you know was quite a distinguished historic area in the british context and so it was an idea that i could go on exchanges i could learn languages i studied german i studied french and then in nineteen eighty three there was the war scare basically provoked by the euro missile crisis so the stationing of new categories of strategic nuclear weapons and intermediate nuclear weapons in western europe and in eastern europe during the height of the cold war and the zero missile crisis over ss twenty and pershing missiles went on from nineteen seventy seven so when i was about eleven or twelve you know all the way through into the later part of the nineteen eighties and in nineteen eighty three we came extraordinarily close to a nuclear conflict it was very much another rerun of the cuban missile crisis of nineteen sixty two so twenty years on same kind of thing the soviets misread although i didn't know this at the time i know a lot of this you know after the fact but the tension was palpable but what happened was the soviets misread the intentions of a series of exercises operation abel archer that the united states was conducting and actually thought that the united states might be preparing for first nuclear strike and that then set up a whole set of literal chain reactions in the soviet union eventually it was recognized that you know all of this was really based on misperceptions and of course you know that later led to negotiations between gorbachev and reagan for the intermediate nuclear forces the inf treaty but in nineteen eighty three that tension was just acute and for as a teenager you know we were basically being prepped the whole time for the inevitability of nuclear armageddon there were tv series films in the united states and the uk threads the day after we had all these public service announcements telling us to seek sanctuary or cover in the inevitability of a nuclear blast and you know my house was so small they said look for a a room without a window there were no rooms without windows my dad put on these really thick curtains over the window you know and said if there was a nuclear flash we'd have to get down on the floor not look up but the curtains would help and we'd be like this is ridiculous dad and then we would all try to see if we could squeeze in the space under the stairs a cupboard under the stairs like harry potter i mean it's all just you know totally nuts or go or you had to throw yourself in a ditch if you were outside and i thought well this this isn't gonna work and one of my great uncles who had fought in world war two said well look you're good at languages fiona why don't you go and study russian try to figure it out figure out why the russians are trying to blow us up because you know during the go talk to them yeah during world war two yeah the united kingdom the united states and the soviet union had all been wartime allies and my uncle charlie thought well there's something going wrong here maybe you can figure it out and as you said go talk to them so i thought okay i'll study russian so that's really how this came about i thought well it's applying education i'll just do my very best to understand everything i possibly can about the russian language and the soviet union and i'll see what i can do and i thought well maybe i could become a translator so i had visions of myself sitting around you know listening to things in a big headset and in a best way translating perhaps at some you know future arms control summit so how did the journey continue with learning russian i mean this is early dream of being a translator and thinking how can i actually help understand or maybe help even deeper way with this conflict that threatens the existence of the human species how did it actually continue well i mean i read everything i i actually possibly could about you know nuclear weapons and nuclear war and you know i started to try to teach myself you know russian a little bit it was always in context of nuclear war it was very much in the context of nuclear war at this particular point but also in historical context because i knew that the united states and the united kingdom and the soviet union had been wartime allies in world war ii so i tried to understand all of that and also you know like many other people i'd read you know russian literature in translation i'd read war and peace and you know i'd love the book actually i mean particularly the you know the the story parts of it i i wasn't one really at that at that time when i was a teenager i thought tolstoy went on a bit you know in terms of his theories of the great man and of history and you know kind of social change although now i appreciate it more but when i was about fourteen i was like this man needed an editor you know could he have just got on with the story what an amazing story what an incredible you know kind of book this is i still think he needs an editor book yeah well i think his wife tried didn't she but he got he got quite upset with her and then i kind of thought to myself well how do i how do i study russian because there were very few schools in my region you know given the impoverishment of the region where you could study russian so i would have to take russian from scratch and this is where things get really quite interesting because there were opportunities to study russian at universities but i would need to have first of all an intensive russian language course in the summer and i didn't have the money for that and the period is around the miner's strike in the united kingdom in nineteen eighty four now the miners of county durham had very interestingly had exchanges and ties with the miners of donbas going back to the nineteen twenties right and as i studied russian history i discovered there was lots of contacts between you know bolshevik soviet union the early period after the russian revolution but even before that during the imperial period in russia between the northern england and the russian empire and the old industrial areas basically big industrial areas like the northeast of england and places like donbas were built up at the same time often by the same sets of industrialists and donetsk in the donbas region used to be called husavka because it was established by a welsh industrialist who brought in miners from wales to help you know kind of develop the coal mines there and also the the steelworks and others that you know we're we're hearing about all the time so i got very fascinated in all these linkages and you know famous writers from the early parts of the soviet union like yevgeny zamyasin worked in the ship shipyards in newcastle upon tyne and there was just this whole set of connections and in nineteen eighty four when the miners' strike took place the miners of donbas along with other miners from famous coal regions like the ruhr valley for example in germany or miners in poland sent money in solidarity to the miners of county durham and there'd been these exchanges as i said going back and forth since the nineteen twenties formal exchanges between miners you know the region of miners' unions and i heard again from the same great uncle who told me to study russian that there were actually scholarships for the children of minors and it could be former minors as well for their education and i should go along to the miners' hall place called red hills where the the miners of county durham had actually pooled all of their resources and built up their own parliament and their own you know kind of place that they could talk among themselves to figure out how to enhance the welfare and well-being of their communities and they'd put money aside for education for minors there was all kinds of lecture series from the minors and all kinds of other activities supporting soccer teams and artistic circles and writing circles for example people like george orwell you know were involved in some of these writers circles in other parts of britain and mining communities for example and so they told me i could you know go along and basically apply for a grant to go to study russian so i show up and it was the easiest you know application i've ever come across they just asked me to my dad came along with me they asked me to verify you know that my dad had been a minor and they looked up his employment record on little cards you know kind of in a little a little tray somewhere and then they asked me how much i needed you know to basically pay for the travel and some of the basic expenses for the the study and they wrote me a check and so thanks to the miners of donbas and this money that was deposited with the miners of county durham with the durham miners association i got the money to study russian for the first time before i embarked on my studies at university as you're speaking now it's reminding me that there's a different way to look both at history and at geography and at different places is you know this is an industrial region that's right and it echoes in the experience of living there is more captured not by moscow or kyiv but by at least historically but by just being a mining town and industrial that's right in the place itself yeah yeah i mean there are places in the united states in appalachia in west virginia and in pennsylvania like the lehigh valley that have the same sense of place and the northeast of england you know was the cradle of the industrial revolution it was the industrial version of the of silicon valley which has its own i would say contours and frames and when you come to those industrial areas your previous identities get submerged in that larger framework i've always looked at the world through that lens of being you know someone from the working class the blue collar communities from a very specific place with lots of historical and economic connotations and it's also a melting pot which is you know the problems that the donbas has experienced over you know the last thirty years so people came from all over the place to work there of course there was a a population that one might say is indigenous you know might have gone back centuries there but they would have been you know in the smaller rural farming communities just like it was the same in the northeast of england and people in the case of the northeast of england came from wales they came from further in the south of england the midlands they came from scotland they came from ireland i have all of that heritage in my own personal background and you've got a different identity and it's when somebody else tries to impose an identity on you from the outside that things go awry and i think that that's kind of what we've really seen in the case of donbas it's a place that's apart in many respects historically and in terms of its evolution and development over time and you know particularly in the case of you know russia the russians have tried to say well look you know because most people speak russia there as the lingua franca i mean in the northeast of england of course everyone spoke english but lots of people were irish speakers you know gaelic irish speakers or you know some of them might have certainly been welsh speakers there was lots of welsh miners who spoke welsh as their first language who came there you know but they but they created an identity it's the same in belfast in ulster you know the northern province of of the you know the whole of the irish ireland and the part of ireland that is still part of the united kingdom that was also a heavily industrialized area high manufacturing mass manufacturing shipbuilding for example people came from all over there too which is why when ireland got its independence in the united kingdom ulster belfast and that whole region you know kind of clung on because it was again that melting pot it was kind of intertwined with the larger industrial economy and had a very different identity and so that you know for me growing up in such a specific place with such a special in many respects heritage gave me a different perspective on things when i first went to the soviet union in nineteen eighty seven to study there i actually went to a translators' institute what was then called the moris terres which is now the institute of foreign languages mhmm i was immediately struck by how similar everything was to the north of england because it was just like one big working class culture that had sort of broken out onto the national stage everything in northern england was nationalized we had british steel british coal british rail british shipbuilding because after world war two the private sector had been devastated and the state had to step in and of course the soviet union is one great big giant nationalized economy when i get there and it's just the people's attitudes and outlooks are the same people didn't work for themselves they always worked for somebody else and it had a quite a a distortion on the way that people looked at the world do you still speak russian i do yeah yeah yeah it would be a big mystery for everybody and you have an advantage on me because it's your native language as well for people wondering the the english speakers in the audience you're really missing a lot from the few sentences said there yeah it's it's it's a fascinating language that stretches actually geographically across a very large part of this world so there you are in nineteen eighty seven an exchange student in the soviet union what was that world world like well that was absolutely fascinating in that period because it's the period that's just around the time of the peak of perestroika mikhail gorbachev's role as president well he wasn't quite present at that point he was secretary general of the soviet of the communist party of the soviet union trying to transform the whole place so i arrived there in september of nineteen eighty seven just as gorbachev and reagan sign the inf treaty it was just within you know weeks of them about to sign that which really ends that whole period that had shaped my entire teenage years of the end of the euro missile crisis by finally having agreement on you know basically the reduction and constraints on intermediate nuclear forces and also at this point gorbachev is opening the soviet union up so we got all kinds of opportunities to travel in ways that we wouldn't have done before not just you know in moscow which is where i was studying at the translators institute but to the caucasus to central asia went all the way to khabarovsk in the russian far east all the way around you know kind of moscow and there was at this point it was also the khryshyni rus which has become very important now this is the anniversary the thousandth anniversary of the christianization of of russia which of course has become a massive obsession of vladimir putin's but you know nine eighty eight because i was there eighty seven to eighty eight at this point the russian orthodox church is undergoing a revival from being repressed during the soviet period you suddenly have the church stepping out as a nongovernmental organization and engaging in discussions with people about the future of religion so that was something that i wasn't expecting to witness also i mean being in moscow this is the cultural capital of a vast empire at this point i'd never lived in a major city before it's the first big city i lived in i'd never been to the opera you know i the first time i go to an opera it's at the bolshoi you know i'd never seen a ballet i mean i was not exactly steeped in high classical culture when you're kind of growing up in a mining region you know there's very limited opportunities for this kind of thing i'd been in a youth orchestra and a orchestra and a youth choir my parents signed me up for absolutely everything they possibly could education wise but it wasn't exactly any exposure to this i was astounded by the wealth of the cultural experience that one could have in moscow but the main thing was i was really struck by how the soviet union was on its last legs because this was moscow you know i'd i'd got this image about what it would look like i was quite to be honest terrified at first about what i would see there the big nuclear superpower and since i got there it was just this like as if a huge weight that i'd been carrying around for years in my teenage years just disappeared because it's just ordinary people in an ordinary place not doing great this is the period of you know what they call deficit nevremia you know so the period of deficits well there's no food in the shops mhmm there was you know very little in terms of commodities because the supply and demand parts of the economic equation were out of whack because this was total central planning you know you'd go into you know a shop that was supposed to sell boots and there'd be just one pair of boots all in the same size and the same color i actually lucked out because once i was in this hungarian boot shop that was right next to where my hall of residence was and i was looking for a new pair of boots and every single pair of boots in the shop were my size and they were all women's boots they weren't men's boots at all you know because there has been an oversupply of boots in that size production but you could really kinda see here that there was something wrong and you know in the north of england everything was closed down the shops were shuttered because there was no demand because everybody lost their jobs it was massive employment you know when i went off to university in nineteen eighty four ninety percent youth unemployment in the uk meaning that when kids left school they didn't have something else to go on to unless they got to university vocational training or an apprenticeship most people were still looking months out of leaving school so shops were closing because people didn't have any money you know i had fifty percent male unemployment in some of the towns as the steelworks closed down and the wagon works for the railways for example in my area but in moscow people in theory did have money but there was just there was nothing to buy also the place was falling apart literally i saw massive sinkholes open up in the street balconies fall off buildings you know one accident after another and then there was you know this real kind of sense even though the vibrancy and excitement and hope of the gorbachev period a real sense of the the the soviet union had lost its way and of course it was only a a year or so after i left from that exchange program and i'd already started with my degree program in soviet studies at harvard that the soviet union basically unraveled and it really did unravel it wasn't like it collapsed it was basically that there were so many debates that gorbachev had sparked off about how to reform the country how to put it on a different path that you know no one was in agreement and it was basically all these fights and debates and disputes among the elites at the center as well as you know basically a loss of faith in the system in the periphery and among the general population that in fact pulled it apart and of course in nineteen ninety one you get boris yeltsin as the head of the russian federation then a constituent part of the soviet union together with the presidents of ukraine and belarus all of these being individual parts of the soviet union getting together and agreeing and essentially ending it and gorbachev you know so basically i'm there at the the peak of this whole kind of period of experimentation and thinking about the future and within a couple of years it's all kind of gone and it's on a different track entirely well i wonder if we reran the twentieth century a thousand times if how many times the soviet union would collapse yeah i wonder about that too and i also wonder about what would have happened if it didn't collapse and gorbachev had found a different direction i mean it's you know we see a very divisive time now in american history the united states of america has very different cultures very different beliefs ideologies within those states but those are that's that's kind of the strength of america is there's these little laboratories of ideas until though that they don't keep together i mean i've had colleagues who have described what's happening in the us right now as a kind of soft secession with states you know going off in their own direction in what in which states well the you know these kinds of conceptions that we have now divisions between red and blue states because of the fracturing of our politics and i'd always thought that that wouldn't be possible in somewhere like the united states or you know many other countries as well because there wasn't that ethnic dimension but in fact many of our the way that people talk about politics has has given it that kind of appearance in many respects because look i mean we know from the soviet union and the soviet period and from where you're from you know originally in ukraine that language is not the main signifier of identity and that identity can take all kinds of of other forms that's really interesting i mean but there has to be a deep grievance of some kind if you took a poll in any of the states in the united states i think a very small minority people would want to actually secede even in texas where i spend a lot of my time yep i i just i think that there is a common kind of pride of nation you know there's a lot of people complain about government and about how the country's going the way people complain about the weather when it's raining they say oh this stupid weather is rainy again yeah but really what they mean is we're in the smock together there's a together there that i i i i also feel that when i go around because i mean i've spent a lot of time since i wrote my book in last october and this last year going around i find the same feeling but you know when i traveled around the soviet union back in the late 1980s i didn't get any kind of sense that people wanted to see the end of the soviet union either it was an elite project there's a a really great book called collapse by vladislav zubac who is a professor at london school of economics at lse and zivok is pretty much my age and he's from you know the former soviet union he's russian and he describes it very quite aptly about how it was the elites that basically decided to pull the soviet union apart and there is a risk of that here as well when you get partisan politics and people forgetting that they're americans and they are all in this together like the lot of the population thing but they think that their own narrow partisan or ideological precepts you know account for more and in the soviet case of course was also a power play you know in a way that actually can't quite play out in the united states because it was the equivalent of governors in many respects who got together three of them you know in the case of the heads of russia ukraine and belarus who then you know got rid of you know basically the central the central figure of mikhail gorbachev it would be a little difficult to do that the dynamic is not the same but it does worry me of having seen all of that close-up in the late 1980s and the early nineties and i spent a lot of time in russia as well as in ukraine and caucasus central asia and you know other places after the collapse of the soviet union but you you kind of see the same elite divisions here in the united states pulling in you know in different in different directions and straining you know the overall body politic and the the way that national politics gets imposed on local politics in ways that i it certainly wasn't when i first came to the us in nineteen eighty nine i didn't honestly in nineteen eighty nine when i first came here i didn't know anybody's political affiliation i mean i rarely knew their religious affiliation obviously race was a major phenomenon here that was a shock to me when i first came but many of the class regional geographic political dimensions that i've seen in other places i didn't see them at play in the same way then as i do now and you take a lot of pride to this day of being nonpartisan that said so you served for the george w bush barack obama and donald trump administrations always specializing in eurasia and russia you were the top presidential adviser to president former president donald trump on russia and europe and famously testified in his first impeachment trial in two thousand nineteen saying i take great pride in the fact that i'm nonpartisan foreign policy expert so given that context what does nonpartisan mean to you well it means being very careful about not putting any kind of ideological lens on anything you know that i'm analyzing or looking out or saying about foreign policy for one thing but also not taking you know kind of one stance of one party over another either to be honest i've i've always found american politics somewhat confounding because both the democratic and the republican party are pretty big tents i mean they're coalitions you know in europe it's actually kind of in some respects easier to navigate the parameters of political parties because you you know you have quite clear platforms you know there's also a longer history in many respects obviously i mean there's a long history here in the united states of the development of the parties you know going back to the late eighteenth century but in the united kingdom you know for example in the twentieth century the development of the mass parties you know was quite easy to get a handle on you know at one point in the uk for example the parties were real genuine mass parties with people who were properly members and took part in regular meetings and paid dues you know it was easy to kind of see what they stood for and the same in europe you know when you look at france and in germany and western germany of course italy and and elsewhere here in the united states it's kinda pretty amorphous you know the fact that you could kinda register you know randomly it seems to be a democrat or republican like trump did mhmm at one point he's a democrat next thing he's a republican mhmm and then you kinda usurp a party apparatus but you don't have to be you're not vetted in any way you're not kind of you know they don't check you out to see if you have ideological coherence you know you could have someone like bernie sanders on the other side on the left you know basically calling himself a socialist and you know running for the democratic presidential nomination so you know kind of in many respects parties in the united states are much more loose movements and i think you can you know it's almost like a kind of an a la carte menu of of different things and that people can pick upon pick out and it's more over time as i've noticed become more like a kind of an affiliation even with the sporting team i mean i i get very shocked by the way that people say well i couldn't do this because you know that's my side and i couldn't do anything and i couldn't support someone for the other side i have a relative in my extended family here who is a is a you know died in the wool republican and on family holiday was a book on their table said a hundred reasons for voting for a democrat and i said hey are you thinking of shifting party affiliation then i opened the book and it's blank it was pretty funny i had to laugh right i thought well there you go then you know there's just there's no way that you know people can pull themselves out of these frames so for me it's very important to have that independence of thought i think you can be politically engaged on the issues but you know basically without taking a stance that's defined by some ideology or some sense of kind of partisan affiliation i think i tweeted about this maybe not eloquently and the statement if i remember correctly was something like if you honestly can't find a good thing that donald trump did or a good thing that joe biden did you're not you're not thinking about ideas you just pick the tribe i mean it was more eloquent than that but it was it was it's basically this is a really good test to see are you actually thinking about like how to solve problems versus like your red team or blue team like a sporting team can you find a good idea of donald trump's that you like if you're somebody who's against donald trump and like acknowledge it to yourself proudly oh that's a good idea i'm glad he said that or he's even asking the right kinds of questions which he often did actually i mean obviously put them in a way that most of us wouldn't have done but there was often kind of questions about why is this happening why are we doing this and you know we have to challenge ourselves all the time so yeah actually why aren't we doing that and then you have to really inspect it and say whether it's actually worth continuing that way or they should be doing something differently now he had a more destructive quality to those kinds of questions maybe it's the real estate developer in him that was you know taking a big wrecking ball to all of these kinds of you know sacred edifices and things like that but often if you really paid attention he was asking a valid set of questions about why do we continue to do things like this now we we didn't often have answers about what he was gonna do in response but those questions still had to be asked and we shouldn't be just rejecting them you know out of turn and you know the the another strength the thing that people often that criticize donald trump will say is is a weakness is is lack of civility can be a strength because i i feel like sometimes bureaucracy functions on excessive civility like it actually i've seen this it's not just it's bureaucracy in all forms like in tech companies as they grow everybody kinda you know you're getting pretty good salary everyone's everyone's comfortable and there's a meeting and you discuss how to move stuff forward and like you don't want to be the asshole in the room that says why this is why are we doing this this way this is on this could be unethical this is hurting the world this is totally a dumb idea like i mean i could give specific examples that i have on my mind currently that are technical but the point is oftentimes the person that's needed in that room is an asshole yeah that's why steve jobs worked that's why elon musk works you have to roll in that's what first principles thinking looks like the one bit when it doesn't work is when they start name calling you know or kind of inciting violence against you know the people that we disagree with so that was kind of your problem because i mean often when you know when i was in the administration i had all of europe in my portfolio as well as russia and there were many times when you know we were dealing with our european colleagues where he was asking some pretty valid questions about well why should we do this if you're doing that you know for example the the nord stream two pipeline the united states has been opposed to europe's reliance on gas and oil exports from russia you know the soviet union since the seventies and eighties and trump kept pushing this idea about so why are we you know spending so much money on nato and nato defense and we're all talking about this if you're all then you know basically paying billions you know to russia for gas isn't this you know contradictory isn't this you know contradictory and of course it was but it was the way that he did it and i actually you know one instance had a discussion with a european defense minister he first said to me look he's saying exactly the same things as people said before him including you know former defense secretary gates it's just the way he says it you know so they took offence and then as a result of that they wouldn't take action because they took offence of what he said so it was a kind of then a way of could you find some other means of massaging this communication to kind of make it effective which we would always try to focus on because it's it's a kind of it was the the delivery yeah but but the actual message was was often spot on in those kinds of issues i mean he was actually highlighting you know these ridiculous discrepancies between what people said and what they actually did and it's the the delivery the charisma in the room too i'm also understanding the power of that of a leader it's not just about what you do at a podium but in in in a room with advisers how you talk about stuff how you convince other leaders yeah you don't do it through gratuitous insults and incitement to violence that's one of the things you just you don't get anywhere with that front well i mean it's impossible tough measures and maximum pressure often though does work right because there were you know oftentimes where you know that kind of relentless you know nagging about something or constantly raising it actually did have results where it hadn't previously right so there's you know the maximum pressure if it you know kind of kept on it in the right way and you know often when we were you know coming in behind on pushing on issues you know related to nato or you know other things in this same sphere it would actually have an effect it just doesn't get talked about because it gets overshadowed by you know all of the other kind of stuff around this and the way that you know he interacted with people and treated people what was the heart the key insights to your testimony in that impeachment look i think there is a straight line between that whole series of episodes and the current war in ukraine because vladimir putin and the people around him in the kremlin concluded that the us did not care one little bit about ukraine and it was just a game for trump it was personal game he was basically trying to get volodymyr zelensky to do him a personal favor related to his desire to stay on in power in the twenty twenty election and generally they just thought that we were using ukraine as some kind of proxy or some kind of instrument within our own domestic politics because that's what it looked like and i think that you know as a result of that putin you know took the idea away that he could you know do whatever he wanted we were constantly being asked even prior to this by people around putin like you know nikolai patrushev the head of the national security council equivalent in russia we met with frequently what's ukraine here we don't get it you know why do you even care so they they thought that we weren't serious that we weren't serious about ukraine's territorial integrity and its independence or or or it's as a national security player mhmm and putin also thought that he could just manipulate the political space in the united states actually he could because what he was doing was seeding all this dissent and fueling you know already in a debate inside of us politics the kinds of you know things that we see just kind of coming out now this kind of idea that ukraine was a burden that ukraine was you know basically just trying to extract things from the united states that ukraine had somehow played inside of us politics trump was convinced that the ukrainians had done something against him that they had intervened in the elections and that was kind of you know a combination of people around him trying to find excuses to you know kind of what had happened in the election to kind of divert attention away from russia's interference in twenty sixteen and the russians themselves poisoning the well against ukraine so you had a kind of a confluence of circumstances there and what i was trying to get across in that testimony was the national security imperative of basically getting our act together here and separating out what was going on in our domestic politics from what was happening in our national security and foreign policy i mean i think we contributed in that whole mess around the impeachment but just the whole parallel policies around ukraine to the war that we now have that we're confronting signaling the value we place in peace and stability in that part of the world or the reverse by saying we don't care no we seem to not care it was just a game but i mean the the us role in that war is very complicated one that's one one that's one of the variables just on that testimony did it in part break your heart that you had to testify essentially against the president of the united states or is that not how you saw it i don't think i would describe it in that way i think what i was was deeply disappointed by what i saw happening in the american political space i didn't expect it look i was a starry eyed immigrant i came to the united states with all of these expectations of what the place would be i'd already been disabused of you know some of the let's just say rosy perspectives i'd held in the united states i'd been shocked by the depths of racial problems it doesn't even sum up the problems we have in the united states i mean i couldn't get my head around it when i first came i mean i'd read about slavery in american history but i hadn't fully fathomed really the kind of the way that it was ripping apart the united states i mean i'd read alex's you know to tocqueville and he'd commented on this and it obviously hadn't you know kind of changed to the expect the way that one would have expect all this time you know from the eighteenth century onwards so that was kind of one thing that you know that i realized the civil rights movement and all of these you know acts of expansion of suffrage and everything else were imperfect at best and i was born in 'sixty five the same time as the civil rights act there was a heck of a long ways to look to go so i wasn't let's just say you know as starry eyed about everything as i'd been before but i really saw an incredible competence and professionalism in you know the us government it was gonna in the government it was gonna in the election system and the integrity of it and i mean i really saw that i saw that the the isis was the gold standard for you know some of its you know institutions and i worked in the national intelligence council and i'd seen the way that the united states had tried to address the problems that it had had faced in this whole botched analysis of iraq and this terrible strategic blunder of honestly a crime in my view of invading iraq and but the way that people were trying to to deal with that in the aftermath i mean i went into the national intelligence council and the dni the director the office of the director of national intelligence when they were coming to terms with what had gone wrong in the whole analysis about iraq in two thousand and three you know in the whole wake of people trying to pull together after nineeleven and to learn all of the lessons from all of this and i saw you know just really genuine striving and and deliberation about what had gone wrong what lessons could we learn from this and then suddenly i found myself in this i couldn't really describe in any word this totally crazy looking glass thinking of alice in wonderland alice through the looking glass version of american politics i mean i'd seen everything starting to unravel over a period of time before i'd been asked to be in the administration but i did not expect it to be that bad i honestly didn't i mean i'd been warned you know by people that this was you know kind of really a very serious turn that the united states had had taken but i really thought that national security would still be uppermost in people's minds and it was with a lot of the people that i work with but what i found if you want to use that term of heartbreaking was the way in which all of these principles that i'd really bought into and tried to uphold in the united states government and in the things that we were trying to do with me and my colleagues were just being thrown out the window and you know i would have to step up in defense of them and in defense of my colleagues who were being lambasted and you know criticized and given death threats for actually standing up and doing their own jobs in particular on the topic of ukraine not just on ukraine but on national security overall so i mean i'd gone through this whole period even before we got to that point mhmm i'm seeing nonpartisan government officials being attacked from all sides left and right but especially the right and being basically accused of being partisan hacks you know deep state coup plotters you know you name it there are patriotism being questioned as well and know a lot of people i work with in government like myself naturalized americans a lot of the immigrants many were refugees and many people had fought in wars on behalf of the united states in iraq and afghanistan being blown up you know they'd put their lives on the line they'd put their family lives on the line you know because they believed in america and they were just they were reflections of americans from all kinds of works of life it's what really made you know that cliche of america great it wasn't you know whatever it was that was being you know banded around in these crude crass political terms it was just the strength of an incredible set of people who've come together from all kinds of places and decided that they're gonna make a go of it and that they're going to you know try to work towards the whole you know idea of the preamble of the constitution towards a more perfect union and i you know i saw people doing that every single day despite all of the things that they could criticize about the united states still believing in what they were doing and believing in the promise of the country which is what i felt like and then here we were people were just treating it like a game and they were treating people like dirt and they were just playing games of people's lives i mean we all had death threats people's you know whole careers which were not just careers for their own self aggrandizement but for careers of public service trying to give something back were being shattered and i find you know i just thought to myself i'm not gonna let that happen because you know i've come from a well if they're going to send me back to bishop auckland in candidderm fine i'm totally fine to go back you know because i could do something back there but i'm not going to let this happen i've made this choice to come to america i'm all in and and these guys are just behaving like a bunch of idiots and they're ruining us you know they're ruining it for everybody so the personal attacks on on competent hardworking passionate people who have love for what they do in their heart similar stuff i've seen for virologists and biologists so colleagues basically scientists in the time of covid when there's a bunch of cynicism and there was just personal attacks including death threats on people that that you know work on viruses work on yeah and they're going on vaccines you know but with protective gear on in case somebody shoots them in the street that's just absurd but let me zoom out from the individual people yep and actually look at the situations that we saw in the in the george w bush obama and donald trump presidencies and i'd like to sort of criticize each by the not the the treatment of individual people but by the results right yeah i think that's fair yeah so so if you look at george w bush and maybe you can give me insights this is what's fascinating to me when you have extremely competent smart hardworking well intentioned people how do we as a system make mistakes in foreign policy so the the big mistake you can characterize in different ways but in george w bush is invading iraq yeah or maybe how it was invaded or maybe how the decision process was made to invade it again afghanistan with maybe not the invasion but details around like having a plan about you know how to withdraw all that kind of stuff then barack obama to me similarly is is is a man who came to fame early on for being somebody who was against a rare voice against the invasion of iraq which was actually a a brave thing to do at that time and nevertheless he and i mean i don't know the numbers but i think he was the president for years over increased drone attacks uh-huh increase like every everything from a foreign policy perspective the the military industrial complex that machine grew in power under him not shrunk and did not withdraw from afghanistan and then with donald trump the criticisms that you're presenting sort of the the personal attacks the chaos the partisanship of people that are supposed to be nonpartisan so the you know if you do sort of to steel man the chaos to to to make the case for chaos maybe we need to shake up the machine throw a wrench into the engine into the gears and then every individual gear is gonna be very upset with that because it's the wrench it's not it's not it's an inefficient process but maybe it leads for government it forces the the system as a whole not the individuals but the system to reconsider how things are done so obviously all of those things the actual results are not that impressive you could have done that on the latter you know shaking things up because i'm all one for questioning and trying to shake things up as well and do things differently yes but you you know the question is if you bring the whole system down with nothing ideas of putting it into place like many people i've studied the bolshevik revolution and you know many others as well and you know kind of what's you know what's the pattern here you know that actually fits into what you're talking about here is a kind of rigidity of thought on the part of revolutionaries in many cases as well and also narcissism in fact i think it takes a pretty you know strong sense of yourself you know kind of an owning yourself to wanna be president of the united states for example we see that in you know many of our presidents have been narcissists to different you know kind of degrees you think about lenin you know for example and people can go back and read about lenin he formed his views when he was about eighteen and he never shook them off he never evolved he didn't have any kind of diversity of thought and when systems go awry it's when they don't bring in different perspectives and so you know trump if he brought in different perspectives and actually listened to them and not you know believe that he himself knew better than anyone else and then tried to divide everybody against each other it would have been a different matter it's a tragedy of a completely and utterly lost set of opportunities because of the flaws in his own nature because i mean again there was all kinds of things that he could have done to shake things up and so many people around him remained completely disappointed and of course he divided and pitted people against each other you know creating so much factionalism in american politics that you know people have forgotten they're americans they think that they're red or blue you know parts of teams and you know if you go back over history that's a kind of a recipe for for war and you know internal conflict you go back to you know the byzantine empire for example there's the famous episode of the nikki riots in constantinople where the whole city gets trashed because the greens the reds the blues and these various sporting teams in the hippodrome get whipped up by political forces and they you know they pull the place apart and that's you know kind of where we've been heading on some of these trajectories but the other point is when you look back you know at bush and obama as well there's a very narrow circle of decision making you know in bush period it's the focus on the executive branch with dick cheney as the vice president being very fixated on it in obama it's you know he and you know kind of the bright young things around him you know from he himself is you know kind of intellectually you know one might say arrogant in many respects you know he was a very smart guy and you know he's convinced that he has he ruminates over a lot of things but he's a person who makes you know a lot of decisions and basically george w bush used to call himself the decider as well right i mean they're all the people who make the decisions it's not always as consultative as you might think it is and for trump it's like i'm not listening to anybody at all you know it's just me and whatever it is that i've woken up today and i've decided to do so i think you know the problem with all of our systems why we don't get results is because we don't draw upon you know the diversity of opinion and all the ideas of you know people out there you do that in science mhmm i mean when i mean all my friends and relatives are in science they're they've got these incredible collaborations with people you know across the world i mean how did we get to these vaccines for the covid virus because of this incredible years of collaboration and of you know sharing results and sharing on ideas and our whole system has become ossified you know we think about the congressional system for example as well and there's you know this kind of rapid you know turnover that you have in congress every two years you know there's no incentive for people you know basically to work with others they're constantly campaigning they're constantly trying to appeal to whatever their base is and they don't really care about you know some do you know of their constituents but a lot of people don't in the senate it's all kind of focused on the game of of legislation for for so many people as well not focusing again on that kind of sense about what are we doing like scientists to kind of work together you know for the good of the country to push things along and also our government also is siloed there's there's not a lot of mechanisms for bringing people together there ought to be in things like the national security council the national intelligence council actually did that quite successfully at times for analysis that i saw but we don't have you know we we have it within the national institutes of health but we saw the the cdc breakdown on this you know kind of front we we don't have sufficient of those institutions that bring people together from all kinds of different backgrounds you know one of the other problems that we've had with government with the federal government over you know state and local government is actually quite small people think that the federal government's huge because of course we have postal service and the military that are part of it but your actual federal government employees is a very small number and you know the senior executive service part of that is the older white guys you know who kind of come up all the way over the last you know several decades we have a really hard time bringing in younger people into that kind of government service unless they're political hacks you know and they want to you know kind of or they're kind of looking for power and you know sort of influence we have a hard time getting people like yourself and other you know younger people kind of coming in to make a career out of public service and also retaining them because you know people with incredible skills often get poached away into the private sector and you know a lot of the people that i work with on the national security side are now at all kinds of you know high end political consultancies or they've gone to silicon valley and they've they've gone to this place and that place because after a time as a younger person they're not rising up particularly quickly because there's a pretty rigid way of looking at the the hierarchies and the promotion schemes and they're also getting lambasted by everybody people are like you know public servants they're not really public servants there's this whole lack and loss of a kind of a faith in public service and you know the last few years have really done a lot of damage we need to revitalize our government system to get better results we need to bring more people in even if it's you know for a period of time not just through expensive contracts for you know the the the big consulting companies and you know other entities that do government work out there but getting you know people in for a period of time expanding expanding some of these management fellowships and the white house fellows and you know bringing in scientists from the outside giving you know that that kind of opportunity for collaboration that we see in other spheres i think that's actually one of the biggest roles for president that for some reason during the election that's never talked about is how good are you at hiring yeah and and creating a culture of like attracting the right i mean basically chief hirer when you when you think of a ceo like the great ceos are i mean maybe people don't talk about it that often but they do more often for ceos than they do for presidents it's like how good are you at building a team well we make it really difficult because of the political process i mean and also because we have so many political appointments we ought to have less to be honest i mean we if you look at other governments around the world you know that are smaller it's much easier for them to hire people in yeah you know some of the most successful governments are much smaller and it's not that i say that the you know the government is necessarily too big but it's just thinking about each unit in a in a different way we shouldn't be having so many political appointments we should kind of find more professional appointments more non partisan appointments because you know every single administration that we've had over the last let's see span of presidencies they have jobs that are unfulfilled because they can't get their candidates through congress and the senate because of all the kind of political games that are being played i know loads of people have just been held up because it's just on the whim of you know some member of congress even though that the actual position that they want is really technical mhmm and doesn't really care about what you know what political preference they particularly have so i think we have to try to look at the whole system of governance in the way that we would over you know other professional sectors and to try to think about this as just as you said there that this is a government that's actually running our country this is an operating system and you wouldn't operate it like that if you were looking at it in any kind of rational way it shouldn't be so ideologically or partisan tainted at every level anyway so i would actually just make a bid for a more nonpartisan approach to a lot of the parts of government you can still kind of bring in you know the political imprimatur but also you have to explain to people writ large in america as well that this is your government and that actually you could also be part of this you know things like the small business administration the us department of agriculture you know all these kind of things that actually people interact with but they don't even know it the postal service you know all of these things i mean people actually when you ask them about different functions of government they have a lot of support for it the national park service for example it's just when you talk about government in an abstract way like oh too much bloated not efficient and effective but if you kinda bring it down more to the kind of local and federal levels that's kind of you know when people really see it if people could see kind of themselves reflected in many of the people who have gone into public service i think that they would yeah they do have a lot more support for it more like superstars like individuals that are like big on social media big in the public eye and having fun with it and showing cool stuff that is not because right now a lot of people see government as basically partisan warfare and then it it just it makes it unpleasant to do the job it makes it uninspiring for people looking in from outside about what's going on inside government all of it the whole whole thing but you you are you know just with all due respect you're pretty rare individual in terms of nonpartisanship like it actually your whole life story the the the humbling aspect of of your upbringing and everything like that do you think it's possible to have a lot of nonpartisan experts in government like can you be a top presidential adviser on russia for ten years for fifteen years and remain nonpartisan i think you can i don't think that's advisable though by the way because i mean i don't think anybody should be there you know to see all the pressure advice is to fire yourself after tax well you should you should you should definitely have term limits just like you should in everything right i mean it's just like tenure in university too you kind of like term limits yeah you kind of you know we do we have natural term limits but you know you're kind of you know basically you're bottling it up for other people i mean you know what i'm trying to do now i'm like i'm fifty seven now and i always try to work with you know people from different generations than me just like you know i've i've really benefited from these you know kind of mentorships of people older you can you know mentor up and well and mentor down i mean i would you know try to get you know people from different backgrounds and different generations to work together in teams obviously i i'd like a more team networked kind of approach to things not the kind of things that you you get again in science right i mean all these ideas are gonna come from all kinds of different perspectives age and experience does count for something but you know fresh ideas and coming in and looking at a problem from a different perspective and seeing something that somebody else hasn't seen before i mean i just you know kind of love working in an environment with all kinds of different people and people who don't agree with you you need people to take you on and say absolute that's crap where did you come up with that from and i go hang on well explain to me why you think so and then you have this kind of iterative process back and forth i would always encourage my colleagues to tell me when they thought it was wrong sometimes i didn't agree because i didn't see the the you know the reasoning but other times i'd be like they're right you know that that was a complete mistake i need to admit that and you know kinda we need to figure out a a different way of doing things but the one point i do wanna get across is there were a lot of people who were non partisan that i worked with i mean honestly in most of the jobs that i had up until more recently i had no idea about people's political affiliation it's just when you get into this kind of highly charged partisan environment they kind of force people you know to make decisions and when you have you know one political party or political faction that's trying to usurp power it does make it quite difficult i mean that's the situation that we're in right now and you know we're seeing some of the things happening like this i've seen and studied in other settings or seen for myself happening you know when you have a president who wants to cling on to power you know you've gotta you've gotta call that out you know is that a partisan act or is that a kind of you know defense of that larger political system that that that you're part of you know so i think we've got to recognize that even if you're not partisan you can be politically engaged and you know sometimes you just have to stand up there and speak out which is what i did and what others did as well none of those people who spoke out initially saw that as a partisan act even if some of them since then have decided to make political choices they hadn't made before because the situation actually forced people into taking sides it's very hard to still stay above the fray when you've got you know someone who's trying to perpetrate a coup yeah just to linger on that i think it's hard and it's the courageous thing to do to criticize a president and not fall into partisanship after because the whole world will assume if you criticize donald trump that you're clearly a democrat and so they will just everybody will criticize you for being a democrat and then so you're now stuck in that so you're going to just embrace that role but to still walk the nonpartisan route after the criticism that's the hard road so not let the criticisms break you into you know into a certain kind of ideological set of positions i mean our political system needs revitalization we need to be taking a long hard look at ourselves here and i think what people are calling out for look there's a vast swathe of the population like me who are unaffiliated you know maybe some lean in one direction over another and unaffiliated doesn't mean you don't have views about things and political opinions you may sound quite extreme on some of those you know either from a left or right perspective what people are looking for is a kind of an articulation you know things in a kind of a clear way that they can get a handle on and they're also looking for representation somebody's gonna be there you know for you you know not part of a kind of a rigid team that you're excluded from you're the ins and the outs look what people are looking at now they're looking at that in the workplace because they're not finding that in politics you're actually getting workers you know pushing the people talk about the rise of the workers people are just saying hang on a sec the most important space that i'm in right now is my workplace because that's where my benefits are from they're not coming from the state i mean that's a peculiarity of the united states system you know in britain you've got the national health service and you've got all the kind of nationwide benefits you know you're not tethered to your employer like you are in the united states but here now we're asking people you know people are pushing for more representation they're asking to be represented within their workplace be it starbucks where various dealers are you know and other starbucks employees are trying to unionize we have unions among our research assistants at the brookings institution where i am you know kind of teaching assistants in big universities doing the same kind of thing as well because they won't have their voice heard they want to kind of play a larger role and they want to have change and they're often pushing their companies or the institutions they work for to make that change because they don't see it happening in the political sphere mhmm so it's not just enough to go out there and protest in the street but if you want something to happen that's why you're seeing big corporations playing a bigger role as well yeah and of course there's you know this is a longer discussion there's also criticisms of them mechanisms of unions to to achieve the giving of a voice to a people this goes back to my own experience growing up in northern england the durham miners that i was part of for generations you know first person in my family not in the mines on my dad's side they created their own association it wasn't a union per se at the very beginning later they became part of the national miners union they lost their autonomy and independence as a result of that but what they did was they pulled their resources they set up their own parliament so they could all get together literally they built a parliament and it you know opened in like the the same time as world war one and where they all got together because they didn't have the vote they didn't have suffrage at the time because they didn't have any money you know so they didn't couldn't pay the tax and they you know they couldn't run for parliament and this is you know the kind of the origins of the organized labour parties later but they create this association so they could talk about how they could deal with things with their own communities and have a voice in the things that mattered you know education you know improving their work conditions it wasn't like what you think about some kind of big political trade union with left wing ideas in fact they actually tried to root out later after the bolshevik revolution in the soviet union even when they were still having ties with places like the mines of donbass in the 1920s trotskyites and you know kind of leninists and you know communists they were more focused on how to improve their own well-being you know what they called the welfare they had some welfare societies where they were kind of trying to think and that's kind of what boosters in starbucks want or workers in amazon they're talking about their own well-being it's not just about pay and work conditions it's about what it means to be part of this larger entity because you're not feeling that same kind of connection to politics you know at the moment because you know you're being told by a representative sorry i don't represent you because you didn't vote for me you know if you're not a democrat you're not republican you're not red you know you're not blue you're not mine and so people are saying well i'm in this workforce this is kind of my collective this is therefore this is where i'm going to have to try to push to make change so i mean this is kind of happening here and we have to you know realize that you know we've kind of gone in a way full circle back to that you know kind of period of the early emergence of mass labour and that's where the political parties that we know today and the early unions came out of as well this sort of feeling of a mass society but where people weren't really able to get together and implement or push for change you know with unions at a small scale and a local scale it's like every good idea on a small scale can become a bad idea in a large scale large scale yeah so like marriage is a beautiful thing but at a large scale it becomes the marriage industrial tries to make money off of it combined with the lawyers that try to make money off the divorce it just becomes there you go caricature of a thing exactly or like christmas and the holidays it's like it's just i i don't disagree but what i'm saying is there's people people are basically looking for something here and you know kind of this is why i mean i myself am starting to think about much more local you know kind of solutions to a lot of these you know kind of problems it's again the teamed network approach mhmm on the impeachment looking back because you're part of it you get the experience that do you think they strengthened or weakened this nation i think it weakened in many respects just the way that it was conducted i mean there's a there's you know new new book coming out by a couple of journalists in the washington post i haven't actually seen it yet but i really did you know kind of worry that myself that it became a spectacle and although it actually i think in many respects was important in terms of an exercise of civic responsibility and you know gave people a big massive lesson in civics everyone's kind of running out and looking up the whole process of impeachment and what that meant and congressional prerogatives i was as well i was you know like running off myself and you know trying to learn an enormous amount about it because i was in the middle of all of this that it didn't ultimately show responsibility and accountability and that in itself was kind of weakened because on both sides there was a lot of partisan politics i mean i think that there was a dereliction of duty in many respects i mean especially i have to say on the part of republican members of congress who were you know kind of they should have been embracing you know congress's prerogatives you could have you know kind of basically done this in something of a different way but the whole thing is because it was this larger atmosphere of not even polarized but fractured politics and i was deeply disappointed i have to say in many of the members of congress on the republican side i mean there's a lot of grandstanding that i really didn't like a bit on the democratic side either and and and not admitting to mistakes and you know not kind of addressing head on you know the fact that they'd you know kind of been pushing for you know trump to be impeached and you know talking about being an illegitimate president you know kind of right from the the very beginning and that you know as a result of that a lot of people just saw this as a kind of a continuation of you know political games you know coming out of the twenty sixteen election but on the republican side it was just a game there was people i knew who were you know basically you know at one point one of them winked at me mhmm you know in the middle of this you know kind of impeachment it's just like don't take this personally you know this is a game this is a game and i just thought this isn't a game and that's why i think that it you know kind of weakened because i mean again on the outside it it weakened us the whole process weakened us in the eyes of the world because again the united states was the gold standard and i do think i mean again in the in the terms of the larger population although a lot of people did actually see the system you know standing up trying to do something to hold people to account but there still was that element of circus and a big political game and people being careless with the country but i do think that the democrats were the instigators of the the circus so as it's perhaps subtle but there's a there's a different way you talk about issues or concerns about accountability when you care about your country when you love your country when you love the ideals and when you versus when you just want to win and stick it to the other side no idea i agree i mean there were people who i actually thought managed that that made it about the country rather than about themselves but i guess there's a lot of stuff to do that yeah there were others who did a lot of grandstanding yeah and that and that's that's another problem of our political incentive structures that the kind of sense of accountability and responsibility tends to be personal you know whether people decide to do it or not it's not institutional if that makes sense we've had a kind of a breakdown of that kind of sense now i took an oath of office and i'm assuming that most of them did too you know i had to be sworn in you know when i took those positions i took that seriously but i already took an oath of citizenship there's you know presumably you did too you know you kind of started to become an american citizen it's not something you take on lightly and you know that's why i felt this deep sense of responsibility all the time which is why i went into the administration in the first place i mean i got a lot of flack for it because you know i thought well look i've been asked and there's a real issue here after the russian interference and you know the whole influence operation in the twenty sixteen elections and i knew what was going on and i should do something you know if not me then you know okay someone else will go and do it but can i live with myself just sitting on the sidelines and criticizing what people are doing you know and kind of you know worrying about this or am i actually going to muck in there and you know just go and do something it's like seeing your house on fire and you see that you know okay this is pretty awful and dangerous but i could go in there and and do something to clarify the house on fire meaning the cyber war that's going on or cyber attacks or cyber security twenty sixteen you know when the russians had interfered in the election you know i i mean basically this was a huge national security crisis and our politics we'd gone mad as a result of it and we in fact were making the situation worse and i felt that i could you know kind of at the time maybe i could do something here i could try to clarify i could work with others who i knew in the government from previous stints in the government to push back against this and try to make sure it didn't happen again and look i also didn't have this you know mad you know kind of crazy ideological view of russia either i mean i knew the place i knew the people i've been studying a long time i'm quite calm about it i don't take it personally it's not kind of an extension of self it's you know something i've spent a long time trying to understand for myself going back to that very beginning of why were the russians trying to blow us up there must be an explanation there was it was a very complicated and complex explanation it wasn't as simple as how it sounded mhmm and also there's a long tail to twenty sixteen you know putin's perceptions the kind of things that he thought were going on the you know the whole way that what they did was actually fairly straightforward they've done this before in the soviet period during the cold war classic influence operation it just it had gone beyond the bounds of anything they could have anticipated because of social media and just a confluence of circumstances in the united states as well we were very fragile and vulnerable and i remember at one point having a discussion with the russian ambassador where you know we were complaining about the russian intervention he said are you telling me that the united states is a banana republic that it's so vulnerable to these kinds of efforts he actually looked genuinely mystified although you know obviously it was probably you know part of a you know kind of political shtick there but he had a point the united states had never been that vulnerable as it suddenly was in twenty sixteen and in the time that i was in government and going back to what you asked about the whole impeachment and the whole exercise in in congress that vulnerability was as stark as it you know ever could be our domestic politics were as much a part of the problem as anything else they were the kindling to all of the kind of the fires yeah putin didn't start any of this other kind of problems domestically he just took advantage of them and you know basically added a bit of an accelerant here and there yeah the interference i mean that's a much longer discussion because it's also for me technically fascinating i've been playing with the idea of just launching like a million bots but they're doing just positive stuff and just being kind yeah i feel as kinda wonder if is it possible to do something on this scale that's positive because you know a lot of people seem to be able to use all of this for pretty negative effect you've gotta kinda hope that you could do this use the same networks for the positive effect i think that's actually where a lot of the war i think from the original hackers to today what gives people like me and i think a lot of people that in the hacking community pleasure is to do something difficult break through the systems and do the ethical thing right so do the because if there's something broken about the system you want to break through all the rules and do something that you know in your heart is the right thing to do i i mean that's what aaron schwartz did with releasing journals and publications that were behind paywalls to the public you had arrested for it and then committed but to me it's fascinating because i i i maybe you can actually educate me but i felt that the russian interference in terms of social engineering in terms of bots all that kind of stuff i feel like that was more used for political bickering than to actually understand the national security problem because i would like to know the actual numbers involved in the influence i would like to i mean obviously hopefully people now understand that better than are trying to defend the national security of this country but it's just it felt like like for example if i launch one bot and then and then just contact somebody at the new york times saying i launched this one bot they'll just say mit scientist hacks you know like they'll just and then that well that it'll spread but that's exactly what happened it was you know kind of i think that you know putin and some of the people around him understood because again propaganda states they spend an awful lot of time thinking about how you you know basically put out your own content and how you get maximum effect through performance putin himself is a you know political pop performance artist i mean he trump understood exactly the same thing they were actually operating in parallel not in collusion but in parallel mhmm you know basically trump understood how to get lots of free airtime you know how to get himself at the center of attention putin did that through a kind of i think a less organic kind of way and he had a lot of people working around him i mean that's the old bolshevik prop and you know kind of then the whole soviet propaganda machine and you know putin kind of growing up in that kind of environment and having you know the kind of the kremlin press office and all the kind of people around him got kind of a massive machine knew how that worked i mean they haven't done you know what the chinese did in russia it was like you know blocking everything and having a big firewall it was kind of putting out lots of content getting into the you know the sort of center attention trump's doing the same kind of thing and the russians understood that you know if you put a bit of things out there and then you know you call up the new york times then people are gonna run with it and what they wanted was the perception that they had actually swayed the election they loved it this was the huge mistake of the democrats and everything i mean they kept trying to push against this mhmm no they did not elect donald trump americans elected donald trump and you know the electoral college was a key part vladimir putin didn't make that up you know and and basically i also remember you know at one point the russian ambassador you know talking to me about when we were doing the standard here we are we're lodging our complaint about the interference he basically said well we didn't invent comey and basically the decision to reopen hillary clinton's emails or anthony weiner and you know kind of his you know emails on his computer and i was like yeah he's right i mean you know there were plenty of things in our own system that created chaos and tipped the election not you know kind of what the russians did but you know it's obviously easier to blame the russians than blame yourself when you know things are kind of or or those random forces and those random factors because people couldn't understand what had happened in twenty sixteen there was no hanging chads like two thousand where there was you know kind of a technical problem that actually you know ended up with the intervention of the supreme court there was you know pure and simple electoral college at work and a candidate that nobody had expected including the republicans in the primaries you know to to end up getting kind of elected or put forward a different twenty sixteen to suddenly becoming the president and they needed a meta explanation it was much better to say vladimir putin had done it and vladimir putin and you know the fantastic champagne cock pop cocks popping this is great our chaos agent they knew they hadn't done it but they'd love to take credit for it and so you know the very fact that other people couldn't explain these complex dynamics to themselves basically dovetails beautifully with vladimir putin's attempts to be the kind of the kremlin kremlin in the system and he's he's you know basically was taking advantage of that forever more and i wanted you know to basically try to work with others to cut through that and the thing is then you know people lost faith in the integrity of the election system because people were out there you know suggesting that the russians had actually to stop the elections people had written books about that they said you know that they hacked the system when you know they were trying to hack our minds but again we were the fertile soul for this i mean we know this from russian history the role of the bolsheviks you know the whole 1920s and 1930s with stalin their fellow travellers and the you know socialist international i mean the russians and the soviets have been up this for years about pulling people along and into a broader frame but it didn't mean that they were influencing you know directly the politics of countries you know writ large there are plenty of interventions it's just that we were somehow it was a confluence of events a perfect storm we were somehow exquisitely vulnerable because of things that we had done to ourselves it was what americans were doing to themselves that was the issue you think that's the bigger threat than large scale bot armies those can be a threat obviously they do have an impact but it's it's how people process information it's kind of like the lack of critical thinking i'm just not on the internet to that extent i had to go looking for information i'm not in social media i'm in social media but not by myself you know i don't put myself out there i'm not i haven't got a twitter feed i haven't got a blog twitter one yeah but there's of fjornhill's cat and all i have all kinds of strange things it's fjornhill's cat which i kinda like you know occasionally have people send things to me you have so many fans it's hilarious but what i what i what i try to do is just be really critical i mean my you know my mom sends me stuff and i'm like what is this you know kind of yeah it's just you know your own mother can be as much of an agent of misinformation as you know a kind of vladimir putin i mean we're all you know kind of we all have to really think about what it is we're reading there's one thing from my childhood that was really important i mean i always think every kid in school should have this my next door neighbor who was he was actually very active in the in the labour party and he was you know kind of really interested in the way that opinion you know shaped people's political views and he was welsh she was a native welsh speaker so you know he was always trying to explore english and how you know there was kind of the reach of you know the english culture and you know kind of and how it's kind of shaping the way that people thought and he used to read every single newspaper you know from all the different spectrums which was quite easy to do you know back in the seventies and eighties because there weren't that many in the uk context and every sunday he would get all the different sunday papers from all the different kind of ideological vantage points and then when i got to be a teenager he'd invite me to look at them with him mhmm because he was my godfather and he was just an incredible guy and he was just super interesting and kind of culturally an outsider always kind of looking in and he basically ran through what the guardian looked at the observer the daily mail the sun you know kind of all of these you know the telegraph all of these newspapers and how you could tell their different vantage points and of course it's complicated to do that now in this incredibly extensive media space i look at what it is that they're saying and then i try to you know read around it and then you know look at what other people are saying and why they're saying it and who are they what's their context and that was kind of basically what i was taught to look at and and i think everybody should have that and certainly that's something that people in politics that are in charge of directing policy should should be doing they should be not getting lost in in the sort of the hysteria that can be created like it it does seem that the american system somehow not the political system just humans love drama we're very good like the hunter biden laptop story we there's always like one two three stories somehow that we just pick that we just gonna this is the stuff we're gonna fight about for for this election and everyone's got an opinion on it yeah everybody yeah yeah exactly and and it's the most like hillary clinton's emails russians hacked the election yeah we had john podesta's pasta recipes for a while you know that we were kind of all obsessing over i don't know people running out and trying them out you know or something like that and there's fun i mean there's all just the best conspiracy theories about giuliani there's it i just love it we just pick a random story sometimes it's ridiculous and it detracts from what the larger question should be which is about the family members of you know senior officials and whether they should be anywhere near any of the issues that they're there's ethics there's government ethics and things there kind of across the board but there's a bigger story in there but that becomes a distraction it's a lock over there you know the oldest trick in the book you know kind of idea yes and and politicians are really good at that because it it they're using it larger question because every single member of congress and you know government official their family should be nowhere near anything they're doing well that i i could push back and disagree on i i mean well it depends on what they do if they're making money out of it you know and kind of basically being in business is what i mean you know kind of this is a this is an issue so it's not you know hunter biden on his own it's you know kind of basically the kids of you know the trump family the you know you name it yeah in in general like that i just think it's it's funny like there's a lot of families that you know they work very closely together do business together and it's very successful i get very weird about that it it just feels like you're not in fact i don't even like hiring or working with friends initially you you make friends with the people you work work with basically no i have the i have the same worries as well because it kinda clouds you know i would encourage you know my daughter to do something completely different not go into the same field no look it's different if you're in science or mathematics or something like this and maybe you've got family member you're kind of building on some of their theories and ideas if albert einstein had an offspring who was in mathematics and took his father's thinking further that that would be very different but if it's you know kind of you're in business and other things and it's just you know it's the nepotism problem that no one has there there well it says that too in a space of ideas what they do if they're not people aren't coming in and building on the ideas in a constructive way right but even for son daughter of einstein you wanna think outside the box of the previous so you don't find meaning but i mean it's just but they shouldn't be sort of told no sorry you can't go and study math because you know or whatever physics you know because of but a lot of that you can't actually make it through into law well you could i suppose but honestly if you do that kind of thing you should be transparent there should be just an honesty about it it gets back to what i was talking about before we need diversity of views and diversity of thinking and you can't have other things it's like being partisan or you know rooting just for a team you know if something's going to cloud your judgment or constrain the way you think about things and become you know kind of a barrier to moving on out i mean look that's what we see in the system around putin it's kind of kleptocratic and it's you know it's filled with nepotism all of the kind of like the people who you kind of see out there in prominent positions of the sons or daughters of including of putin himself i mean that's when a system has degenerated and that's gonna kind of and i suppose in a way this is a symbol of the degeneration of the system but again it's just a a diversion from you know kind of the bigger issues and bigger implications of things that we're discussing so critics on the left often use the straw man of tds trump derangement syndrome why does donald trump arouse so much emotion in people it's just the nature of the person i mean i don't feel particularly emotional about him i mean he's kind of a he's a very flawed guy to be honest on this missing bizarre i felt sorry for him because this guy is so vulnerable so wrapped up in himself that i mean he he's just exquisitely open to manipulation and i saw people taking advantage of him all the time he has zero self awareness i mean i kept thinking to myself my god if this guy didn't have this entourage around him how would he function i mean i felt sorry for us as well i mean that he ended up being our president because that should not have happened i mean in terms of character and in terms of fit for fit for the job although i saw this you know kind of over a period of time but i didn't feel you know kind of any you know sense of derangement you know kind of around him it didn't drive me nuts in that way i just became i was just very worried about you know the kind of the impact that he was having on on on many particular issues here's the important thing so what what i noticed with people that criticize donald trump is they get caught up in the momentum of it and they're unable to see first of all let's start with some ground truth which is approximately half the country voted for the guy right yep and more voted in twenty twenty than voted in twenty sixteen for him yep yep and i i just i just feel like people don't load that in when they're honestly a lot of those people didn't vote for him and his personality and often could because i know a lot of people who voted for him first time and second time and they could disassociate you know kind of the all of the kind of features of donald trump that drives other people nuts from you know what they thought that in actual fact he could achieve in terms of and it wasn't just this kind of sense about well i couldn't possibly vote for democrats sometimes it's just like well look he shakes things up and we need things to shake to to be shaken up and some people might have voted for a person see this won't try to stop some of them not some of them did as well but i'm just saying that not all of them did either oh we don't have bad data that's the thing but i i yeah i can't say how much is i'm just saying anecdotally i know people have voted him because he's him from the charisma and and others who voted because he's shaking things up and you know he's keeping people on their toes and you know kind of we need that you know idea but the way to avoid trump derangement syndrome to to me me as a as a doctor i'm sort of prescribing to the patients on this syndrome this this issue is i feel like you have to empathize with the people well you have to imagine your mind all the different like strengths that the people who have voted for donald trump see and really understand it really feel it like walk around with it and then criticize like i just feel like people get lost in this bubble of criticism in their own head forget like the tribe you're in or whatever in their own head they're not able to see like half this country that we're a part of voted for the person same with biden half the country voted for the guy the people that are criticizing biden and they're doing this the way biden is currently criticized is not based on policy it's based on personal stuff similar like to trump yeah i know it is i mean that's what people do look i think part of that is i mean look first of all i wanna say i completely agree with you about understanding where people are coming from and i think it's very important for people to listen to other people and their views i try to do that all the time try to learn from that you know i mean everybody's got a perspective and a context we all live in a certain context we're all living in history our own personal histories matter a lot and also the the larger context and environment in which we're living in and where we live and who we live with and you know the kinds of lives that we lead as well those are all extraordinary important i mean i know that from you know myself everything you know that i've done in my life has been shaped by where i came from who i was my family and the way that we looked at things you can't take yourself out of that i mean you can do it in some you know like a science or something else but you know it's still your own views and maybe some of the ideas that you have and pursuing an experiment might have been shaped by your larger context you know depending on what it is that you work on but the other thing is the nature of the political system the presidential election is like a personality contest a beauty contest it's like a kind of a referendum on you know one person or another it's kind of like what we see in russia on the sea with you know putin or not putin or putin and putin before you know it's all about putin and you know what do you think about putin it's all about what the president should be doing and you know kind of what their policies are that's kind of the bizarreness of the us political system look we've just seen this happening in the united kingdom you've got this core of a couple of thousand couple of hundred thousand rather people in the conservative party who've just voted for you know three leaders in a row the rest of the country is and then they're just looking at you know whether they like that personality and you know what they say to them rather than what they're necessarily gonna do for the country i mean which is you know kind of pretty absurd and i mean again the presidency is a weird hybrid in the united states you know we were talking before about it's the person who should be running the country to the chief executive or the prime minister in another setting but we don't think of it like that you know we often think about whether we like the guy or not so you know we'd like to hang out with him you know one of my younger relatives and i said so why did you vote for trump he said well he was great it's funny i went to his rallies i got you know all kinda charged up and i said could you see yourself voting for biden oh he's too old and i said well no he's only just a little bit older than trump or he's the same age as your grandma do you think your grandma's older oh no not at all but it's just this kind of perception he's boring people are actually sometimes basically being motivated by just a feeling that kind of sense because that's the sort of nature of the presidency it's this kind of how you feel about yourself as an american or how you feel about the country writ large the kind of symbol of the state look at you know in britain you had queen elizabeth the second and everybody you know seemed to for the most part not everyone i guess but most people respected her as a person as a personality as a kind of symbol of the state even if they actually didn't really like the institution of the monarchy there was something you know kind of about that particular personality that you were able to you know kind of relate to in that context but in the united states we've got all of that rolled into one the head of state the symbol of the state the kind of queen the king the kind of idea the chief executive the kind of prime ministerial role and then the commander in chief of the military it's all things you know kind of at once but ultimately for a lot of people it's just how you feel about that person oh i couldn't vote for them because of this or i couldn't vote for them because of that and in twenty sixteen hillary clinton actually did win the election in terms of the popular vote so it wasn't that you know kind of people wouldn't vote for a woman i mean more people voted for her on the popular level not obviously you know through the electoral college and the electoral college vote so it wasn't just you know gender or something like that but it was an awful lot of things for people who found trump attractive because he was sticking up the big middle finger to the establishment he's an anti establishment change character there was a lot of people voted for barack obama for the same reason and voted for trump we know that phenomenon what was it eleven you know twelve percent of people you know so they could vote for some completely totally different radically different people because of that sort of sense of change and charisma i mean i had people who i knew voted for trump but would have voted for obama again if he'd run again because they just liked the way that he spoke they liked the way that you know because they said i mean this is all my own anecdotal things one of my relatives said i could listen to obama all day every day i just loved the way he sounded i loved the way he looked you know i loved just like the whole thing about him and then say about trump well he was exciting he was interesting you know he was kinda like you know whipping it up there so there's just this kind of feeling you know we always say about you know could you have a beer with this person and people decide they couldn't have one with hillary clinton and you know maybe they could go off and have one with barack obama and with donald trump they didn't want to have one with joe biden you know for example and remember george w bush didn't drink so he wouldn't have had a beer with him he'd have gone out and got a soda or something with him but you know there's this there's that kind of element of just that sort of personal connection in the way that the whole presidential election is set up it's less about the parties it's less about the platforms and it's more about the person yeah and picking one side and like sticking with your person really like a support team yeah it is yeah what do you think about vladimir putin the man and the leader let let's actually look at the full you've written a lot about him the the recent vladimir putin and the full context of his life let's zoom out and look at the last twenty plus years of his rule in what ways has he been good for russia in what ways bad well if you looked at the first couple of terms of his presidency i think you know on the overall ledger he would have actually said that he'd made a lot of achievements from russia now there was of course the pretty black period of the war in chechnya but you know he didn't start that that was boris yeltsin that was obviously a pretty catastrophic event but if you look at then other parts of the ledger of what putin was doing you know from the 2000s you know onwards he stabilized the russian economy brought back you know confidence in the russian economy and financial system he built up a pretty impressive team of technocrats for everything from the central bank and the economics and finance ministries who you know really got the country back into shape again and solvent paid off all of the debts and you know really started to build the country back up again domestically and you know the first couple of terms again putting chechnya to one side which was a little hard because i mean there was quite a lot of atrocities and i have to say that you know he was pretty involved in all of that because the fsb which he'd headed previously was in charge of wrapping up chechnya and it created kind of a very strange sort of system of fealty almost a feudal system in the kind of relationship between putin at the top and kadyrov and chechnya and there was quite a lot of distortions you know kind of as a result of that in the way that the russian federation was run and a lot more of an emphasis on the security services for example but there was a lot of pragmatism you know opening up the country for business you know basically extending relationships i would say that you know by the end of those first couple of terms of putin russians were living their best lives but you know there was a lot of opportunity for people people's labour was being paid for they weren't being taxed the taxes were coming out of the extractive industries there was you know kind of i guess a sense of much more political pluralism it wasn't the kind of the chaos of the olsen period and then you see a shift and it's pretty much when he comes back into power again in two thousand eleven two thousand and twelve and that's when we see kind of a different phase emerging and you know part of it is the larger international environment where putin himself has become kind of convinced that the united states is out to to get him and part of it goes back to the decision on the part of the united states to invade iraq in two thousand and three there's also you know the recognition of kosovo in two thousand and eight and you know the the whole kind of machinations around all kinds of you know other issues of nato expansion and elsewhere but iraq in two thousand and three and this kind of whole idea after that that the united states is in the business of regime change and perhaps you know has him in his crosshairs as well but there's also then kind of i think a sense of building crisis after the financial crisis and the great recession two thousand and eight two thousand and nine because i think putin up until then believed in you know the whole idea of the global financial system and that russia was prospering and that russia you know part of the g8 and actually could be genuinely one of the you know the major economic and financial powers and then suddenly he realizes that the west is incompetent that you know we totally had mismanaged the economy of our own the financial crash in the united states the kind of blowing up of the of the the the housing bubble and that we were feckless and that we that had global reverberations and he's prime minister of course you know in this kind of period but then you know and i think that that kind of compels him to kind of come back into the presidency and try to kind of take things under control again in two thousand eleven two thousand twelve and after that he goes into kind of a much more sort of focused role where he sees the united states as a as a big bigger problem and he also you know starts to you know kind of focus on also the domestic environment because his return to the presidency is met by protests and he genuinely seems to believe because again this is very similar to belief here in the united states that donald trump couldn't possibly be elected by americans there somehow was some kind of external inter interference because the russians interfered and had an impact putin himself thinks at that time it's one of the reasons why he interferes in our elections later that the united states and others had interfered because he knew that people weren't that thrilled about him coming back they'd kind of like the medvedev period and the protests in in moscow and st petersburg and other major cities he starts to believe are instigated by the west by the outside because of the funding for transparency in elections and all of the ngos and others you know they're operating state department embassy funding you know the the and and you know the whole attitudes of oh god he's back you know kind of thing and so after that we see putin going on a very different footing it's also somewhere in that period two thousand eleven two thousand twelve we start to kind of obsess about ukraine and he's always you know i think been kind of steeped in that whole view of russian history i mean i heard at that time i was in i've written about this and many of the things that you know i've written about putin but in that same time frame i'm going to all these conferences in russia where putin is and peskov his press secretary and they talk about him reading russian history i think it's this in this kind of period that he formulates this idea of the necessity of reconstituting the russian world the russian empire he's obviously been very interested in this he's always said of course that the collapse of the soviet union was the great catastrophe of the twentieth century but also the collapse of the russian empire before it and he starts to be critical about lenin and the bolsheviks and he starts to do all this talking about ukraine as the same country ukrainians and russians being one and the same and this is where the ledger flips because i mean the initial question you asked me is about has russia has putin been good for russia or not this is where we get into the focal point of or the point where he's not focusing on the prosperity and stability and future of russia but he starts to obsess about the past and start to take things in a very different direction he starts to clamp down at home because of the rise of opposition and the fact that he knows that his you know brand is not the same as it was before and his popularity is not the same as it was before because he's already gone over that you know that period in anybody's you know professional and you know political life that you know if you stay around long enough people get a bit sick of you you know it's just we talked about that before should you stay you know kind of in any job for a long period of time you need refreshing and you know kind of putin is starting to look like he's going to be there forever and people are not happy about that and would like their chance as well to kind of move on and move up with him still in place that's not going to be particularly possible and that you know it's around the time when he starts to make that decision of annexing crimea and that's when the whole thing flips in my view the annexation of crimea in twenty fourteen is the beginning of the end of you know vladimir putin being a positive force within russia because if you pay very close attention to his speech on the annexation of crimea in march of twenty fourteen you see all of the foreshadowing of you know where we are now it's already of kind of his view of kind of his obsessions his historical obsessions his view of himself has been kind of fused with the state of kind of a modern czar and his idea that the west is up to get him and it becomes after that almost a kind of like a messianic mission you know to turn things in a different direction and who are the key people to you in in this evolution of the human being of the leader is it petrochef is it shoigu the minister of defense is it like you mentioned peskov the press secretary what role does some of the others like lavrov play i think it's more rooted in the larger context i mean individuals matter in that context but it's just kind of like this shared worldview and if you go back to the early nineteen nineties immediately after the dissolution of the soviet union when yeltsin you know and the his counterparts in ukraine and belarus pulled it apart there was an awful lot of people who you know wanted to maintain the soviet union not just putin i mean you remember after gorbachev tried to have the new union treaty in nineteen ninety one and there was the emergency committee set up the coup against gorbachev it was because they were worried he was going too far and unravelling you know the union then as well they they were opposed to his reforms there's always been a kind of a very strong nationalist contingent that become russian nationalists over time rather than soviet you know hardliners who you know basically want to maintain the empire the union in some form and in the very early part of the 1990s there was a lot of pressure put on ukraine and all the other former soviet republics now independent states by people around you know mayor lyushkov for example in moscow by other forces in the russian duma not just vladimir zhirinovsky and others but really serious what we would call him like right wing you know nationalist forces but it's you know pervasive in the system and it's especially pervasive in the kgb and in the security sector and that's where putin comes out of remember putin also was of the opinion that one of the biggest mistakes the bolsheviks made was getting rid of the orthodox church as an instrument of the state and so there's this kind of restorationist wing within the security services and the state apparatus the one to kind of bring back russian orthodoxy as a state instrument an instrument of state power and they were kind of you know looking all the time about strengthening the state the executive the the presidency and so it's everybody who takes part in that and it's also others who want power honestly and they see putin as their vehicle for power i think people like sergey kiryenko i knew kiryenko back in the nineties i mean my god that guy's all in or like dmitry medvedev you know who was you know a warmer fuzzier version of putin certainly had a totally different perspective wasn't it in the kgb did you say warmer fuzzier version yeah he was literally a warm personality i don't know if you watched him during the september thirtieth annexation the guy had all kinds of facial twitches and looked so rigid and stiff that he looks like he might implode i mean that wasn't you know how he was you know earlier in his career and he you know had a different view of perestroika we always have to remember that putin was not in russia during perestroika he was in dresden watching the east german state fall apart and you know dealing with the starsian in a kind of place where you weren't getting a lot of information about what was happening in west germany or even what was happening back home in perestroika and he has that kind of group of people around him the patrushevs and botnikovs and others and sergei ivanov and others you know from the different configurations of his administration who have come out of that same kind of mindset and are kind of you know wanting to to put everything back together again so there's a lot of enablers and a lot of you know power seekers and there are a lot of people who you know think the same as him as well he's he is a man of his times a man of his context you as a top advisor yourself and and a scholar of putin do you think it actually now in his inner circle are there people he trusts there are people he trusts for some things but i don't think there's people he trusts for everything i don't think he's the kind of person who tells anyone everything at all i don't think he's got some ever or no no he he he's he's i think he compartmentalizes things he's often said that the only person he trusts is himself and i think that's probably true he's the kind of person who keeps his own counsel i mean people talk about kovalchuk for example or you know kind of some of the other people who are you know friends with him that go back to his time in saint petersburg you know at various points he seemed to you know spend a lot of time you know way back when talking to people who were you know people think of kind of more moderating forces like alexey kudrin but you know doesn't seem to be interacting with them there are obviously aspects of his personal life does he speak to his daughters does he you know speak to you know kind of lovers you know kind of in a way people speculate about you know kind of who might he confide in but i would greatly doubt that he would have deep political discussions with them he's a very guarded very careful person what about sources of information then so trust a deep understanding about military strategies with for certain conflicts like the war in ukraine or even special subsets of the war in ukraine or any kind of military operations getting clear information deeply suspicious you know of people and of of information mhmm and i think you know part of of the problems that you know we see with putin now i mean i've come from isolation during covid i'm really convinced that you know like many of us a lot of putin's views have hardened and the way that he looks at the world have been shadowed in very dark ways by the experience of this pandemic you know obviously it was in a bubble different kind of bubble for most of us i mean most of us are not bubbles with multiple you know kind of palaces and you know the kremlin but you know we've seen you know so much it's obviously a lot of this is staged that isolation you know the kind of making it very clear that he's the czar the guy who is in charge making all the decisions you know at one end of the table and everybody else is at the other end but you know it's very difficult then to bring you know information to him in that way he used to have a lot of information bundled for him in the old days by the presidential administration i know that because it was a lot more open in the past and i've had a lot of meetings with you know people in the presidential administration who brought outside you know all source information you know for him and you know kind of funnelled in information from different think tanks and you know different viewpoints and maybe a kind of more eclectic diversified set of information he would meet with people you know you've heard all the stories about where he had once called up masha gessen and had to come in obviously a very different character as a journalist and a critic we've heard about benediktiv from ekko moskvie the you know the radio programme the the editor who putin would you know talk to and consult with he'd reach out people like lyudmila alexiva for example the head of memorial he had some respect for her and would you know sometimes just you know talk to her you know for example all of that seems to have come to a halt can you tell me what i think a lot of us worry i mean us who you know watch putin about what kind of information is he getting you know is it is it just the information that he's seeking and gathering himself that fits into his worldview and his framework we're all guilty of that of looking for things it gets to our social media preferences are people just bringing to him things that they think he wants to hear like the algorithm you know kind of like the kremlin working in that regard or is he himself tapping into a source of information that he absolutely wants and remember he is not a military guy he's an operative and he was sort of trained in operations and you know contingency planning sergei shoigu the defense minister as a civil engineer was the former minister of emergencies he wasn't a military planner he had somebody like gerasimov the head of the chiefs of staff maybe a military guy you know in this case from the army but he's also somebody who's in a different part of the chain of command he's not somebody who would spontaneously start telling putin things and putin comes out of the fsb out of the kgb of the soviet era and he knows the way that you know intelligence gets filtered and works he's probably somebody who wants to consume raw intelligence he doesn't probably want to hear anybody else's analysis and he's thrived in the past of you know picking things up from people you know i've taken part in all of these meetings with him gone for hours because he's just collecting he's collecting information he's sussing people out he wants to know the questions they ask he he learns something about the questions that people ask the way that they ask them you know so he's kind of soliciting information himself and if he's cut off from that information you know because of circumstances then you know how is he formulating things in his head and again getting into you can't get into his head but you can understand the context in which he's operating and that's where you worry because he clearly made this decision to invade ukraine beyond the back of most of his security establishment you think so oh i think it's pretty apparent oh what what what would the security establishment what would be the well that would be the larger you know thinking the funneling in information from the presidential administration from the national security council it looks like you know he made that decision with a handful of people and then you know having worked in these kinds of environments and it's not that dissimilar you filter information up so think about you know you and i are talking for hours here if if you were my you know basically you know senior official and i'm your briefer i might only get twenty minutes with you and you might be just like you know looking at your watch the whole time and thinking hang on a second i've got to go and i've got this meeting and i've got that meeting and yeah your point you're not going to wait there so i give this long explanation i've got to get to the point and then i've got to then choose for myself what's the information i'm going to impart to you out of the twenty things that i think are important you know okay i've got suddenly get two minutes maybe you know you get called out yeah and and somebody you know kind of interrupts something happens i'm gonna get one minute two minutes yeah i mean i once remember i had to give a presentation when i was in government that's real you know to henry kissinger you know for that defense policy board and we planned bloody weeks on this thing you know powerpoints were created teams of people were brought together and you know people were practicing this we had all these you know different people there and i said look henry kissinger is an academic and a former professor and you know i happen to you know i've got to watch him in action he's gonna like you know five seconds in if we're if we're lucky we get that far ask us a question and just throw off our entire presentation what is it that we want to convey and that's exactly what happened and then you know people aren't really prepared or they wanted to convey and they're you know prepared a you know a nice sort of fulsome you know powerpoint like approach we never even got there and so god knows what you know he took away from it at the end of it and that's you know think about putin he's going to be kind of impatient he's you know we see the televised things where he you know kinda sits at a table a bit like you know people won't necessarily see us here and he puts his hands on the table and he looks across at the person and he says so tell me you know what's the main things i need to know and of course the person's mind probably goes blank you know with the the kind of the thought of like oh god what's the main thing and they go and they start well vladimir vladimirovich they start the kind of you know they're revving up you know to get to the point and then it cuts them off so you think about that and then you think about well what information has he got and then how does he process it and is he suspicious of it does he not believe it and what and what inside of his own history then you know leads him to make one judgment over another he clearly thought the ukrainians would fall apart in five seconds we don't know if he clearly thought that but that there was a high probability maybe i mean you can guess i think he pretty much thought it because i think he thought that you know kind of yuzelinski wasn't very popular there was an awful lot of you know pro russian sentiment in whatever way he thinks that is because people have russian speakers and you know they're kind of you know in polling they expressed affinity with russia i mean certainly in crimea that worked out because a majority of the population had higher sentiments or feelings of affinity with russia obviously that kind of they got traction there but it's more complicated we talked about donbas before about being a kind of melting pot when they tried the same thing in donbas donetsk murkhans because they tried in crimea in twenty fourteen didn't kind of pan out in fact you know a whole wall broke out they tried you know to kind of you know many of the major cities that are now under attack including odessa to kind of ferment you know pro russian movements and they completely and utterly fell apart so putin was thinking you know i'm pretty sure based on polling and the fsb having infiltrated you know an awful lot of the ukrainian hierarchies we're now seeing as quite apparent with so many of the dismissals in ukraine he was pretty sure that you know kind of he would get traction and that it would be like nineteen fifty six in hungary or nineteen sixty eight in czechoslovakia remember he comes out of the andropov levy as it's called a kind of cohort of people who come under the kgb under yuri andropov and yur andropov has presided over a lot of these anti dissidents movements inside of russia itself and how you suppress opposition but also over how you deal with the uprisings in czechoslovakia and hungary and there's all these lessons from this that you could put everything back in the box and yeah there might be a bit of violence and a bit of fighting but ultimately you you think you've got the political figures and you decapitate the opposition so they thought you've let zelensky would run away yanukovych ran away but you know that was kind of a bit you know sort of a different set of circumstances and they thought that all of the local governments would you know kind of capitulate because they had enough russians in inverted commas in there again mistaking language and you know kind of positive affinity towards russia for identity or how people would react in the time and not understanding people's you know linkages and you know kind of importance of place the way that people feel about who they are in a certain set of circumstances in a place but the invasion of ukraine in twenty twenty two is unlike anything that he was ever involved with so i i would be i don't think he thought it would be you know because it's this kind of if he looks back into the past you're right though he wasn't involved in but sixty eight or fifty six or what happened in the nineteen eighties in poland but there's a very wide front and it's the capital and it's key i mean this isn't going for this isn't chechnya this isn't you know kind of syria or for example yeah this is a major nation exactly like a it's large to the size it was more like afghanistan but they didn't realize that because again ukrainians are us there's this kind of inability to think that people might think differently and might want something different and that thirty years of independence actually has an impact on people and their psyches and if i look back to the nineteen nineties i mean i remember being in seminars in at harvard at the time and we were doing a lot of research on you know what was happening in you know the former soviet union at the time because the early 1990s just after the you know the whole place fell apart and there was already under yeltsin this kind of idea of russians abroad russians in the near abroad russian speakers and the need to bring them back in and i remember you know we had seminars at the time where we talked about at some point there'd be some people in russia that would actually believe that those russian speakers needed to be brought back into russia but that the people who spoke russian might have moved on because they suddenly had other opportunities and other windows on the world i mean look what's happened in scotland you know for example most people in scotland speak english the scottish language is not the standard bearer of scottish identity it's almost a civic identity a different identity than not just national identity just like you see in ukraine and there's lots of english people that have moved to scotland and now think of themselves as scottish or brazilians or italians and you know all kinds of people who've moved in there i mean it's a smaller population obviously and it's not the scale of ukraine but you know people feel differently and there's been a devolution of power and when brexit happened you know scotland didn't want to go along with that at all and wanted to kind of still be you know having a window on europe and that's kind of historic and lots of people in ukraine have looked west not east you know it depends on where you are not not just in lviv you know or somewhere like that but also in kyiv and and kharkiv you know was kind of predominantly a russian speaking city but kharkiv was also the center of ukrainian culture and ukrainian literature you know at different points people have different views i grew up in the north of england we don't feel like the south of england there's been a massive divide between north and south of england for millennia not just centuries so you know people feel differently depending on where they live and you know kind of where they grew up and putin just didn't see that he didn't see that well hold on a second let me sort of push back at the fact that i don't think any of this is obvious so first of all zelensky before the war was unpopular oh it was what was it thirty eight percent something like that but but best in the popularity yeah let me sort of make the case that the the calculation here is is very difficult if you were to poll every citizen of ukraine and ask them what do you think happens if russia invades just like actually each put each individual ukrainian in a one on one meeting with putin and say what do you think happens i honestly think most of them will say that they will they will agree with a prediction that the government will flee it would collapse and the the the country won't unite around a cause because of the factions because of the popularity of the factions he might have said the same thing about the soviet union when hitler invaded in nineteen forty one you see the problem is putin always reads history from one perspective over another i think most countries basically rise to their own defense so this is actually one of the first times that russia has been on the offensive rather than on the defensive you know so there's kind of a a bit of a flip there mhmm i mean obviously afghanistan but you know that was more complicated because it was but it was also supposed to annex afghanistan it was to right try to you know prop up you know kind of or reinstall a you know a a leader there syria you were in there to you know help your guy bashar al assad you know turn away the opposition chechnya was a debacle the chechens fought back big time and it was only by dint of you know horrible violent persistence and ruthlessness and nasty dirty tricks that you know kind of putin prevailed there but and then you know you wonder did he prevail because what happened you know chechnya sometimes describes the most independent part of the russian federation and ramzan kadyrov you know plays power games in moscow yeah his predecessors even his father and others wouldn't have done that ahmed kadyrov and you know before that dudayev and muscadiv i mean they were willing to make a compromise but you know they wouldn't have had you know the same position that kadyrov has had so you know i think that again it's it's your perspective and where you stand and what which bit of history you start to read and that's why i say that you know can i think putin it's again it's the information the way that he processes it i think most russians also can't believe that they've done something wrong in ukraine i mean maybe at this point things are changing a bit but that's why there was so much support for this in the right way i have russian friends again who said look what was happening in donetsk look what was you know the ukrainians were doing to our guys you know look what was happening to russian speakers you know we were defenders we were not you know we're not invaders i think you know again the special military operation idea now i think it's flipping obviously in the way that with the war going on there but putin wasn't you know kind of looking at what would happen i mean most of the kind of glory parts of russian history when you kind of go in you know you chase napoleon back to paris or you chase the germans back to berlin you put the flag above the reichstag mhmm that's a very different set of affairs when you've been fighting a defensive one you've been invaded from a war where you invade someone else and even the most fractured populations like you had in the soviet union the point rally around and you know world war i that that fell apart i mean the czar didn't manage to rally everybody around mhmm i mean the whole thing fell apart and world war two stalin had to you know revive nationalism including in the republics in central asia and elsewhere to revive nationalism and ukraine suddenly found nationalism you know in a kind of sense of that's really interesting i because it's not it's not obvious especially what ukrainians went through in the nineteen thirties it's not obvious that that i mean my grandfather was ukrainian and he was proud to fight a ukrainian jew he was proud to fight and willing to die for his country it wasn't like his country then was the soviet union the soviet union right sorry to clarify but he might fight now for his country ukraine yes but it i i'm just like lingering in the point you made it was not obvious that that united feeling would be there no and again it wouldn't have been obvious for the soviet union that that's what sorry yeah that's what i'm saying sorry i was referring to my grandfather of the soviet union we're both saying the exact same thing yeah we no yeah we are we're the same thing it's a really powerful thing because i take it because you take history as it happened you don't realize it could've happened differently it's kind of it's fascinating it's that it's that whole counterfactual right yeah yeah because i mean if you if you've kind of that's that's why we all need in the united states to really examine our own history because you know there's a lot of lessons from that that you know we we should treat very cautiously it doesn't mean that you know history repeats or even rhymes you know that's the old axiom all the time but there are a lot of things that you can take away differently from putting a different perspective and a different slant on the same set of events i mean i always used to wonder like how many books can be written on the french revolution or even on the russian revolution you know i studied with richard pipes i remember he was really offended after he'd written his great micro surplus on the russian revolution two volumes so that other people would you know kinda write about the russian revolution he said i've written it all and i thought well actually maybe you haven't it's like there might be some completely different angle there that you haven't really thought of and that's putin you know i remember peskov saying putin reads history all the time and russian history and i thought well maybe he should read some world history maybe he should read some european authors on russian history not just you know reading lamanosa for you know russian historians on russian history because you might see something from a very different perspective look and the united states made a massive mistake in vietnam right i mean they saw vietnam as kind of weak manipulated by you know kind of external forces china soviet union but the vietnamese fought for their own country they suddenly became vietnamese and ho chi minh became you know basically a kind of a wartime fighter and leader you know in a way that you know perhaps people wouldn't have understood either you said united states made a massive mistake in vietnam and that for some reason sprung sprung a thought in my head has united states since world war two had anything that's not a mistake in terms of military operations abroad i i suppose all the ones that are successes we don't even know about probably so it's like very fast military operations i mean korea is divided i mean i don't know what's successful but you know kind of i mean there was a a solution found that you know some people are promoting you know in this case as well of a sort of division and a you know the dmz and you know one side over the other and you know kind of perpetuating a division which i think is particularly successful but if you think about world war one and world war two the united states came in you know under some very specific sets of circumstances in world war one they did kinda come in to help you know kind of liberate parts of europe france and you know kind of the uk and you know everything else great britain in in the war towards the end of it world war two you know there was that whole debate about whether the united states should even be part of the war i mean we know it wasn't thought to you know overturn the holocaust and all of the kind of things you kind of wish it had been fought for but it was because of pearl harbor and you know the japanese pulling in but you know ultimately it was easy to explain why you were there you know particularly after pearl harbor and what had happened it was harder to explain vietnam and korea and you know many that there wasn't that's kind of gonna be a problem for putin and that's why there is a problem for putin all of his explanations have been questioned you know started off on nato or this or that or the other and you know kind of liberating ukraine from nazis or you know kind of basically stopping the persecution of russian speakers and all of this has now got lost in just this horrific destruction and that's what happened in vietnam as well it became you know a great degradation of the russian military with atrocities and people wondering why on earth the united states was in vietnam i mean even that kinda happened in britain in the colonial you know kind of period as well why was the united kingdom doing you know committing atrocities and you know kind of best be fighting these colonial wars northern ireland why was the united kingdom still you know kind of militarily occupying ireland cyprus there's all kinds of you know instances where we look at this thing what russia is doing now putin is trying to occupy another country irrespective of you know kind of the historical linkages and you know the kind of the larger meta narratives that he's trying to put forward there what role did the united states play in the lead up and the actual invasion of of ukraine by russia a a lot of people say that i mean obviously vladimir putin says that part of the reason the invasion had to happen is because of security concerns over the expansion of nato and there is a lot of people that say that this was provoked by nato do you think there's some legitimacy to that case look i think the whole situation here is very complicated and you have to take a much longer view than you know what happened in you know two thousand eight with the open door for ukraine and georgia which actually by the way i thought was a strategic blunder just to be very clear because it wasn't any kind of thinking through about what the implications of that would be and you know what it actually would mean for ukraine's security and also bearing in mind what you know putin had already said about nato expansion they they came on the wake of the recognition by the united states pre unilaterally of kosovo and it also comes in the wake of what i mentioned before the invasion of iraq which really is very important for understanding putin's psyche so i think you know we have to go back you know much further than it's not just talking about kind of nato and what that means nato is part of the whole package of ukraine going in a different direction from russia just as so is the european union remember the annexation of crimea comes after ukraine has sought an association agreement with the european union not with nato at that particular point even though you know the eu on the security common security defense policy basically has all kinds of connections with nato you know know various different levels in european security front it was all about europe and going on a different economic and political and ultimately legal path because if you have an association agreement eventually you get into the aki comminitaire and it just transforms the country completely and ukraine is no longer the ukraine of the soviet period or the russian empire period it becomes you know on a different trajectory like czech republic slovakia poland you know another country it becomes a different place it moves into a different space and that's part of it but if you go back again to the period at the very beginning of the 1990s after the dissolution of the soviet union where there's no discussion about nato at that point and nato enlargement there was a lot of pressure again as i've said before by nationalist settlements on ukraine trying to bring it back in the fold and wanting to make what was then you know this mechanism for divorce more of a mechanism for remanage the commonwealth of independent states and in the early 1990s when ukraine became an independent state it inherited that nuclear arsenal from the soviet union basically whatever was stationed positioned in ukrainian territory at the time became ukraine's strategic and you know kind of basically intermediate and tactical nuclear weapons and you know in the united states at the time you know we had all this panic about what was gonna happen with all of that so i mean i think you know as a scientist and you know kind of technically it would have been difficult for ukraine to actually use this i mean the targeting was you know done centrally they were actually stationed there but nonetheless ukraine like belarus and kazakhstan suddenly became nuclear powers and you know ash carter the former us defense secretary who's just died tragically and was dave was talking about you know talking together today was part of a whole team of americans and and others who you know tried to work with ukraine belarus and kazakhstan to get them to give up the nuclear weapons and back in the early period of that ninety three ninety four you go back and i mean i was writing about this at the time i wrote a report called back in the ussr which is you know kind of on the website of the kennedy school with you know some other colleagues and we were monitoring how there was all these accusations coming out of of moscow the defense ministry and the duma the the parliament and others that ukraine was trying to find a way of making a dirty bomb using its nuclear weapons you know becoming a menace and you know kind of ukraine might have to be brought to order so a lot of the dynamics we're seeing now were happening then irrespective of nato basically the problem was always ukraine getting away yeltsin himself when he unraveled the soviet union didn't really want it to unravel but he didn't have the wherewithal to bring you know the countries back again russia was weak after the collapse of the soviet union its economy imploded it had to give sovereignty to all of these constituent parts of the russian federation in terms of its devolution of authority it had the war in chechnya which yeltsin stupidly sparked off in nineteen ninety four you had tatastan one of the regions the all rich regions you know basically wresting out a kind of a bilateral treaty with moscow the whole place was kind of seemed like it was falling apart so that you know you couldn't do anything on ukraine because you didn't have the wherewithal to do it and then when you know kind of basically russia starts to get its act back together again all of these security nationalist types who had never wanted ukraine or belarus or moldova or anywhere else to kind of move away they didn't worry that much about central asia to be frank but they know they did want you know the the core states in their view to come back moldova was part of that even if it's not slavic but you know they wanted belarus and northern kazakhstan and probably kazakhstan as well which wasn't really thought about being as part of central asia back in the fold as close as possible so anything that gave those countries an alternative was seen as negative it could have been an association with china you know of them joining you know kind of an association with latin america or africa or something else like that but of course nato has all of those larger connotations of it being into the cold war opposing entity and putin has always seen nato as being the direct correlation of the warsaw pact which is in other words just something dominated completely by the united states now that of course is why getting back to trump again trump was always going to the europeans if this is really supposed to be collective security and a mutual defense pact why are you guys not paying you know why does the us and states pay for everything but you know nato was actually conceived as collective defence you know mutual security and it was set up by you know the united states along with the uk and france and you know germany and turkey and you know other countries and we see that now with the entry of finland and sweden they didn't have to join nato they didn't want to join nato for a long time they wanted to partner with it just like israel and you know the countries partner with nato but once they thought that their security was really at risk they wanted to be part of it and so you know kind of you're now really seeing you know that nato was something other than just being you know a creature or an instrument of the united states but that's how putin always saw it so you know what this debate about nato is all about or russia being provoked is wanting to kind of return to an old superpower bipolar relationship where everything is negotiated with the united states it's to try to deny that ukraine or belarus well belarus has been absorbed by this point you know by russia or moldova or kazakhstan or any of the other countries have any kind of agency not even poland or hungary or you know kind of france and britain for years and years and years senior people like putin and people around the kremlin have demanded a return to the kind of what they call the the old concert of europe or the concert of vienna where the big guys which now means the united states and russia just sit down and thrash everything out and so i mean putin by saying look it was provoked it's united states it's nato it's a proxy war or it's it's this or it's that or this is gonna be a nuclear confrontation it's like the cuban missile crisis it's the euro missile crisis it's basically just saying you know i want to go back to when the soviet union the united states worked things out i want to go back to the whole know period of the 1980s when gorbachev and reagan just kinda got together and figured things out or even better back to yalta potsdam and tehran and the big you know meetings at the end of world war two where we resolved the whole future security we've had a war we've had the cold war now we've got another war we've got a real war hot war we've got a war in ukraine it should be the united states and russia that sort this out so this is where we see the united states waffling about as well trying to kinda like figure out how to handle this because it has to be handled in a way that ukraine has agency because if ukraine doesn't have agency nobody else has agency either nobody else has any kind of decision making power and you know we have an environment in which putin thinks that there's only really three players there's the united states and russia and china and maybe occasionally it might be india and perhaps brazil or some other south africa or some other country like maybe the brics at some point but you know ultimately it's like the oldest big powers resolve everything and so this war is also about russia's right putin's right you know to determine things you know strong man to strong man big country to big country and you know determine you know where things happen next that's why he's talking about things being provoked since being the united states' fault but aren't there parts of the united states establishment that likes that kind of three party view of the world oh there's always gonna be people who like that path that that approach of course there is but then they don't necessarily dominate that's the kind of thing that people kind of think about i mean you know putin can you know read you know all the various articles and hear the kind of pronouncements of people but you know this gets back to you know the way that the united states operates you know putin saw that you know trump wanted to have a top down you know vertical of power and other presidents have wanted to have that but the united states is a pretty messy place and we have all kinds of different viewpoints now of course we know that in russia everything even criticism in the kremlin is usually fairly orchestrated usually to kind of flesh out you know what people think about things when we had these hardliners saying you know we needed more destruction of ukraine not less and that you know the army wasn't doing enough it was in many respects encouraged by the kremlin to see how people would react to that to kind of actually create a constituency for being more ruthless than you had before because you know they wanted to clamp down in the united states i mean i can say whatever i want it doesn't mean that i'm speaking on behalf of the white house and you know even if i have been an adviser to this president that president and the other it doesn't mean i'm you know basically speaking on behalf of the us government but there's kind of always an assumption from the russians that you know when people you know say this and people do advocate one thing over another that they're you know it's operating there's a lot of mirror imaging think of it you know we're operating in the same kind of way so yes there are of course constituencies who think like that would love it it'd just be back to that and there are many people out there with their own peace plans all kinds of people you know out there to push this there does seem to be the engine of the military industrial complex seems to give some fuel to the hawks and they seem to create momentum in government yeah but other people do too i mean there's always you know kind of a a check i mean again you believe in the tension of ideas at every idea i think there is a lot of tension i mean i've seen it i've seen it inside of the government now you know and people can push back and that's why i speak out and i try to lay it out so that everybody can you know kind of figure out for themselves i i say the same to you as i say to everybody this is how i see the situation and you know this is you know how we can analyze it here now look do i think that we've handled you know the whole russia account you know for years well no we haven't i mean we've we've we've taken our eyes off the ball many times we've failed to understand the way that people like putin think you know you talked earlier about you know we need to have empathy for you know all the people who like trump or like biden and some other thing we've gotta have strategic empathy about putin as well we've got to understand how the guy thinks and why he thinks like he does you know he he has got his own context and his own frame and his own rationale and he is rational he is a rational actor in his own context we've got to understand that we've got to understand that he would take offense of something and he would take action over something it doesn't mean to say that you know we are necessarily to blame by taking actions recognize that something might happen as a result of something so you've been in the room with putin let me ask you for some advice and it's also just a good philosophical question for you or for me if i have a conversation with vladimir putin right now can you advise on what questions topics ideas to talk through to him as a leader to him as a human what would you like to understand about his mind about his thinking yeah remember what i said before that putin always tries to you know reverse things he wants to hear the questions that that people have because remember he himself at different points has been a recruiter which is you know the way that you're operating now as well right you're asking an awful lot of questions your questions also betray you know often the times where you're thinking about things you know the kind of context kind of any kind of dialogue like this reveals a lot about the you know the other person and i've actually often noticed in these settings that putin likes to have a lot of give and take so i think he would actually enjoy having a conversation with you but again he would always be trying to influence you inform and influence that's kind of you know part of the way that he always operates so what you would have to you know be trying to think about so what is it that you would want to elicit information from him you're trying to understand the guy's worldview and what we're trying to also understand is if there's any room there where he might compromise on something you know so if your goal was to go in there you know to talk about ukraine at this particular moment i mean one of the problems that i've often seen in the sort of the meetings we've had with putin it just ends up in sort of mutual recriminations you know kind of no well what about what you've done or no you've done that about you know and there's always this what aboutism i mean it often says well you're saying that i've done this but you've done that the united states invaded iraq what's the difference between you know what i'm doing and all of the things that you've been doing here i mean what you would have to try to do is kind of elicit information about why or what he is thinking about this particular moment in time and why he thinks it yeah the whataboutism is a is a failure case i think that shows from all the interviews i've seen that with him that just shows that he doesn't trust the person on the other side no he doesn't right but i i i'm not cynical like people's they they seem to think he's some kind of kgb agent that doesn't trust anybody i disagree i think everybody's human and from my perspective i'm worried about what i've seen is i think whether it's covid whether it's other aspects that i'm not aware of leading up to the invasion he seems to be less willing to have charismatic back and forth dialogue yeah an open discussion you know actually i mean you know i said you asked me before about you know that issue of trust and he often says he only trusts himself and i said you know he's often you know distrustful of people but he does trust some people for certain things where he knows it's within their competence yeah so he has people he trusts to do things because he knows they'll do them and he knows that they'll do them well which is why he has his old buddies from saint petersburg because he's known for a very long time and he knows that they want you know try to pull a fast one over him but he also knows their strengths and their weaknesses and what they can be trusted to do i mean he's learning that you know some of the people in the military that he you know thought were competent or people on other things are not right and he tends to actually have a lot of loyalty to people as well or he also kind of thinks it's best to keep him inside the tent than outside and he moves them around he kind of okay he gives them multiple chances to redeem themselves if they don't it's not like he hasn't done in i mean yeah there is a lot of that in the system but the people that he's worked with for a long time he moves them around to something else perhaps where they can do less harm although you know we often see that he has quite a small cadre of people that he's reliant on and often you know they're not up to the task which is kind of what's happening here but he also in the past has been more straightforward just like you were saying here more pragmatic and i think you know if you were engaged with him in russian well you're actually literally speaking the same language because there's so much lost in translation i used to jump out my skin listening to some of the phone calls because you know the way that they kinda relayed you know with an interpreter oh because you're listening to the translation no because i know i'm listening to the russian and the translation and the translation you know in real time and i haven't been at a translator's institute it's really difficult yeah look an an interpreter is trained in the moment to do something you know the the the the the the the the synchronised or the real time translation so translation is an art as well as a skill mhmm if you're doing simultaneous translation that's the word in english you know in russian you're you're kind of focused in the moment on the fragments of of the discussion and trying to render it as accurately as you possibly can and when you come out of that you you can't relay the entire conversation mhmm and often you know what translators do is they you know they take this little short hand note like journalists do and afterwards you know they they they've just been caught up in the moment and they haven't got the big picture consecutive translation is different you know kind of you're trying to convey the whole mood of like big chunks of dialogue that have already been there but you know sometimes you might not get that right either and it breaks up the flow of the discussion that's terrible and and often it's you know the kind of the person who translates it's different you know some of our best translators are women but you know hearing a woman's voice you know translating a guy who has a particular guy's way of speaking and a macho way of speaking and a crude way of speaking you know be that putin or i've seen that happen with erdogan the president of turkey you know and it gets translated by a much more refined female speaker you've just lost the whole thing and you know many of the translators on the russian side are not competent in english in the way that you would hope they are they're not it's not just that they're not native speakers they're just not trained to the same high standards they used to be in the past yes and you just lose the nuance you lose the feel you almost need the interpretive actor you know doing you know the kind of the interpretation for that you need to match it as much as you can in the way that you you know do voiceovers in film the best way to talk to putin is one on one in his own language and i have a really great friend here who is one of the best interpreters putin is often asked by the you know the media to interpret for him he just just he was at the institute that i was at i know him from that kind of period and he is just excellent just like pavel plashenko was absolutely phenomenal at interpreting gorbachev now he didn't always interpret him accurately because gorbachev made lots of grammatical gaffes and sometimes was you know gorbachev himself would joke that polashenko you know spoke better for gorbachev than gorbachev could himself but putin is actually quite precise and and careful in the way that he speaks because there's a lot of menace sometimes to things deliberately other times there's lots of humor and he's telling a joke for a particular reason and all of it is i mean he actually uses the richness of the russian language and the crudity of language that can't be conveyed in english facial expressions that go all over the place body language the way that he sits back in the chair and slouches the the kind of the way that he makes fun of people and he you know kind of uses irony just some of it is just lost and it needs to be conveyed the depth of humor and wit i met quite a few like political leaders like that in the speak only russian when i was traveling in ukraine i i don't know how you translate that i think it's almost the other person that reminds me like that a little bit is obama there's obama had a wit and an intelligence but like he would smile as he said something that add a lot to it like like that he's trolling you or he's being sarcastic or like i don't it's me converting into words it's obvious to all english speakers if they listen to obama but if you had to translate to a different language i think you're gonna lose a lot of it yeah i mean when i watched the i mean i watched many of putin's speeches you know just in russian not looking at any of the you know the subtitles or anything and it's just watching the way that his body language is at the at the time when he's saying things the way that he smoke he'll sneer he'll laugh he'll ad lib you know kind of from something that obviously kind of you know wasn't there on the prepared speech and it's really critical and you know kind of a lot of some people speak you know like trump it just needs kind of just words mhmm putin the words are very important trump is the atmosphere it's the kind of the way you feel about things it's the buzz you get you know it's revving people up it's the kind of slogans and putin is you know he's conveying a lot in what he's saying there i think i mean of course i don't know much because i only speak russian and english but i have in english or russian have not met almost anyone ever as interesting in conversation as putin the i think he shines not in speeches but in interactions with others yeah when you watch those interviews and things with him and i've you know been at many of these sessions it's been hours of him parrying questions and it's like watching a boxer sparring you know in a kind of training bout yeah come on give me another one you know and it's kind of like and he prides himself and he's made mistakes often but the breadth of you know the issues that he's often covered has been fascinating i used to just take you know kind of really detailed notes about this because you learn a ton but it's also about his worldview again i mean he does live in a certain box like we all do and you know again his world experience is not as extensive as you know you would hope it would be but that's why you have to really pay attention that's where we've messed up that's where we haven't really paid a lot of attention to what he's been saying he's been telegraphing this grievance this dissatisfaction this i'm gonna do something for years and the thing is during wartime the combined with propaganda and the narratives of resentment and grievance that you dig in on those like maybe you start out not believing it but you're sure it's all gonna believe it eventually well you convince yourself over time yeah look the longer you're in a position like putin twenty two years now coming up in twenty three years could be out there for thirty six years you become more and more rigid i mean this is again you know something that you see in history you know you look at you know people through history have moved from kind of being kind of left wing in in a in a perspectives to hard right they kind of have a kind of a sort of an ossification or a rigidity emerges in their views i mean again i used to have these arguments with professor pius about lenin because he would talk about lenin i said but he didn't change his mind from being eighteen have you not thought about that i mean it's like we're not formed fully formed individuals at eighteen you know we don't know anything we know something but not everything i mean that and obviously the younger context you know the kind of the way that you kind of grow up the place you grow up the things that happened to you the traumas you have i mean all of these have an impact but then if you don't grow beyond all of that and putin's been stuck in place since two thousand when he became president he's not out and about you know kind of being a man of the people you know he's not doing the kind of things that he used to do yeah he gets out there and he goes to kazakhstan and you know got to tajikistan and he goes to china and he does this and that and then due to covid he didn't go anywhere i mean very few places and so he got he's got stuck and that worries me a lot because you could see before that he you know had a bit more of flexibility of thought and that's why nobody should be in place forever you should always kind of like get out there and go out there and learn a new skill you know kind of it needs some it needs to sort of you know it needs you to get out more and do something different you had an interesting point you've made that both vladimir zelensky and putin are thinking about they're just politicians they're thinking about the twenty twenty four election which is coming up for both of them yeah i've said that in some of the other interviews yeah that's true that's so interesting i i mean i because their election's gonna be pretty much at the same time as the us election also oh those will be before i mean because it's sometime in that you know early part of the year of the presidential election yeah and also i don't know if you know about us elections but they actually last way longer than a year we're in it now aren't we you know already yeah we're already starting yes so there's gonna be a significant overlap yeah you know you're right that actually comes into play in their calculus or if i think it was one of the reasons why putin invaded in february twenty twenty two because it was gonna be two years i mean he thought it'd be over by march of twenty twenty two and he got two years to prepare for you know the election and he got a big boost you know not only he he got a boost from crimea i mean i didn't mention that before i mean one of the reasons for invading crimea and annexing or invading ukraine the first time annexing crimea was look what happened to his ratings they went from kind of declining and they were still pretty good you know by anybody's standards to just rocketing off into the stratosphere i mean i didn't really meet anybody in russia who thought that accessing crimea was you know kind of a bad thing i mean even you know kind of people who were post putin on so many other things crimea was you know krymnash they kept saying you know this is kind of you know we got it back you know it should never have gone away it was ours you know but you know this is more complex and he wasn't i i don't think at the time planning on annexing all of ukraine when he went in this special military operation he was gonna try to turn it into what belarus has become you know part of a you know bring back the commonwealth of independent states or the union then a new union with belarus and ukraine and russia over time but certainly you know remove ukraine as a major factor independent factor on the world stage and you know consolidate crimea and maybe you know kind of incorporate donetsk and luhansk you know kind of that was that was also a possibility but it wasn't it wasn't in his intention in any case to have something on this kind of scale he wanted to get on with then preparing for what was gonna be he would think the cakewalk the shoe in of the next presidential election i mean last time around he had to invite a bit of competition with his the person who's reputed to be his goddaughter ksenia sobchak you know for a bit of you know kind of entertainment for people you know this next time around you know maybe he wasn't really planning on running you know against any other you know serious opposition he was just gonna have the acclaim of you know the kind of the great leader like president xi in china you know putin you know was basically i think he also hoped that he would be able to devolve some authority away kind of so he's more like the supreme leader kind of figure the czar like figure the monarch and then other people get on with the chief executive prime ministerial running the country and he could step back and just enjoy this maybe there was gonna be again a new union of belarus russia and ukraine in some fashion he could preside over that so speaking of opposition you've criticized the famed putin critic alexei navalny what's the nature of your criticism well well it's really been a kind of a criticism in the way that you know people have implied but more just reminding people that navalny isn't some stooge of the west as other people have depicted him in the russian firm saying that this is kind of you know he's pro western he's a russian nationalist and a russian patriot you know in the past he's articulated you know things are not so dissimilar from some of the people around putin and it's more just reminding people that you know just because you kind of see somebody you know as a kind of an opposition figure or somebody who might be more palatable from you know your perspective russian context he's different from but he wouldn't necessarily you know kind of run you know the russian system in ways that we will like so that's it's kind of it's not a kind of a criticism it's more of a critique of the way that we look at things you know i think it's a mistake to always say oh this is pro western or this is a liberal i mean what the heck does that mean pro western i mean he's a russian he's a russian nationalist and a russian patriot and he's often you know been you know quite critical about immigration he's had some negative views about you know one part of the member said don't feed the caucuses you know kind of played upon some of the racial and ethnic tensions inside of russia itself as well now he is a pluralist and he's kind of and he wants to have you know a different set of political actors there but he also isn't promoting revolution he's not lenin he's not wanting to bring down the state he wants to kind of you know change the people who are in charge that's what he's being basically focused on and you know he might have things and do things that you know we elsewhere might not like and i guess the bigger picture there is it's not trivial to know that if you place another human in power to replace the current human in power that things are gonna be better they could be a lot worse because there's a momentum to a system a system is bigger than just its leader even when that leader has a huge amount of power that's absolutely right and you know he grew up in that you know same system now he's younger than putin so he's got a different generational perspective and he's not wedded to the soviet union or you know kind of some concept of the russian empire he doesn't seem to spend a lot of time i don't know what he's doing you know in jail but he's probably not sitting around you know reading lomonosov and you know the kind of the great kind of tracts of russian history could be actually but i mean i think you know navalny has a different worldview and a different perspective just like medvedev was different you know in his time and presidency and made some you know changes and some innovations there but don't think that they're gonna be radically different because of gorbachev i mean he was so different from andropov and chynenko and this is the person but he was also constrained by the system and he wanted to have change but he wanted evolutionary change he didn't know how to do it but he didn't want to bring the whole system down look at khrushchev when he came in you know after that whole period of you know everybody trying to figure out what to do after stalin had died and there was all this kind of back and forth and eventually khrushchev emerges and you you know he tries to make changes to the system but he's also a creature of a very specific context he's grown up in the same system and he you know kind of brings all kinds of elements of chaos there in order to the whole thing and you know gets into a standoff of the united states that we know as the cuban missile crisis and eventually you know gets removed you know we're looking at what's happening in the united kingdom right now they've just churned through three prime ministers and actually five prime ministers in you know kind of as many years but all of those prime ministers have come out of the context of the conservative party and they're all kind of just shades of the same thing they've all come out of the same academic and privileged backgrounds even rishi sunak the new prime minister who's the first indian or anglo indian prime minister in british history it was a kind of phenomenal you know kind of as a child of indian immigrants but also a person of great privilege from the same academic and party background as the others you know so there there there are always differences with those human beings but those contexts matter a lot what is the probability that russia attacks ukraine with well putin's definitely been thinking about it right i mean he's the kind of person if he's got an instrument he wants to figure out how to use it you know we look at polonium we look at novichok you know we look at all kinds of things you know that he's also presided over in syria he has you know put in charge of the war in ukraine now general severikin is known as general armageddon you know the kind of person who you know pretty much facilitated the use of chemical weapons in syria you know for example so you know don't think that putin you know hasn't thought about how ruthless he can possibly be the question is really the calculation it's it's his estimation of the probability that it will get the desired effect we keep talking about this idea of escalate deescalate that's not what the russians you know how they call it but it's the whole idea that you do something really outrageous to get everybody else to back off yeah now when you talked about the precedent that the united states set of detonating the nuclear weapons in hiroshima and nagasaki what you know he obviously meant the precedent of using nuclear weapons of course which of course we would then say well we showed then how the impermissibility of ever doing that again but what he's talking about is the precedent of escalating to such an extent that you stop the war because he reads that saying well you know the us dropped the bombs on hiroshima nagasaki the war was brought to a quick conclusion and of course there's a huge debate in america about whether it was necessary to do that whether the war was ending anywhere did that really you know kind of change the minds of the japanese high command i mean there's all kind of books being written about that and of course you know the revulsion that people felt in the wake of that was just you know just the shock of of what actually happened and we've spent you know seventy years you know basically coming to terms with the fact that we did something like that you know the firebombing you know we've we've also looked at all the bombing you know in vietnam and everywhere and you know the the the all these massive bombing campaigns and realising they actually often had the opposite effect hiroshima nagasaki might have contributed and there's a lot of scholarship suggesting it did to the end of the war but all of the big bombing campaigns and the destruction actually prolonged wars because they made people fight back as we're kind of seeing in the case of ukraine so putin has to calculate the probability that if he uses some tactical nuclear weapon that it'll get the desired effect which is get us to capitulate and ukraine to capitulate us to capitulate meaning the united states and the europeans not supporting ukraine anymore pushing towards the negotiating table and negotiating ukraine away and ukraine saying okay we give up like happened in hiroshima and nagasaki or in japan so it's it's his calculation you know as much as anything else which is really upon he said we have to show him that he won't get that out of it it's kind of less our probability and you know kind of the odds of it it's just how he calculates that probability of getting what he wants i mean i guess that's how the game of poker works it's your your probability and your estimate of their probability and your estimate of their estimate of your probability and yeah so it goes on yeah exactly i think he has two tools right so one is the the actual use of nuclear weapons and then the threat of the oh the threat is very effective and the more real you make the threat that's right so it's like the more you approach the actual use like get very close to using already using chernobyl zaporizhzhia and then yuzhno ukraine's the other nuclear reactor so he's using civilian nuclear reactors as a dirty bomb so you know it's ironic that he has sergei shoigu his defence minister calling people up and saying the ukrainians are going to use a dirty bomb they're already doing it what is more destructive and stirring up all the radioactive dust in chernobyl as you send your troops to for example or shelling the chernobyl plant in the sarcophagus and putting it at risk and zaporizhzhian you've got the international atomic energy agency running out there in utter panic and also trying to intervene in the conflict so you're putting you know civilian nuclear reactors at risk i mean that also has the great added effect of cutting off ukraine's power supply because zaporizhzhia in particular was probably a third of ukraine's power generation or some really high percentage i'd have to go back and take a look at that but that's a twofer you know it's a kind of a double effect there of undermining power generation also frightening germans and others who've already been very worried about nuclear power and you know increasing your leverage on the energy front but also scaring people from the perspective of the use of nuclear weapon those reactors also become a nuclear weapon tactically deployed and as you said the the discussion of using a nuclear weapon and engendering all those fears and he's already got an effect everyone's running around talking about the cuban missile crisis and secret diplomacy and how we negotiate away ukraine in return for putin not blowing up a nuclear weapon so he's got a lot of people obviously talking about that so sorry for the difficult and dark question it could be for you directly or more like do you think we have a plan for this what happens if he does drop a nuclear weapon do you have a sense that the united states has a good plan i know we're talking about it i think we probably have several plans because it depends on what where when how but don't and also don't these things i'm also very quickly well there's also signaling and sign and signs of of movement there i mean i wanna be very you know kinda careful about this but then the thing is it's also very important that we do this with other nuclear powers so look the other thing that's different from how it might have been in the past and particularly different from the cuban missile crisis the iran missile crisis we're not the only nuclear players china i mean has a major nuclear arsenal now less on the strategic side but building it up but very much on the intermediate range and tactical kim jong un is firing off weapons left right and center at the moment in north korea we've got other rogue states putin's behaving like a rogue state just to be very clear here and this is what we've got with kim jong un in north korea we've also got india and pakistan we've got other states we're not supposed to talk about that we now have nuclear capacities and others that would like to have nuclear capacity and the whole question here is about also proliferation getting back to that time when ukraine had nuclear weapons at least there on its territory in belarus and kazakhstan you've got to wonder was it wise for them to give it up we were worried about you know kind of loose nukes nuclear weapons you know kind of getting out of hand proliferation at the time we wanted fewer nuclear powers russia wanted that too now we're gonna have more we've got more and what putin is saying is well that was stupid of ukraine to give up the nuclear weapons in fact my colleagues and i back in our report back in the us kind of suggest they shouldn't give them up and then that's why we had the budapest memorandum that's why the united states and the united kingdom in particular have you know basically some responsibility and obligation going back to nineteen ninety four when they promised ukraine that gave up the nuclear weapons that territorial integrity and sovereignty would remain intact some obligation to actually do something to step up if we step back from that this is the thing that people are not talking about you know what about nuclear proliferation if you're south korea you're japan you know you're any other country that's kinda worrying about your neighbors and you know what might happen to you and just like india and pakistan are both like woah you know we've gotta kind of keep our strategic nuclear balance here everything is up for questions saudis will want a nuclear weapon the turks already want one they've talked about one for years you know why should the iranians be the only one with an islamic nuclear weapon you know and if if we know that you know iran has breakout capacity now the saudis and all the other you know states that are in opposition to iran will also want to have some nuclear capacity and the united states before wanted to maintain everything under the nuclear umbrella now one of the reasons why sweden and finland are joining nato is because of suddenly all of these nuclear threats sweden was actually the last country on the planet to want to have nuclear weapons they were actually pushing for a ban on nuclear weapons at the united nations now that putin's doing the nuclear saber rattling you know they're talking about joining and and are on the verge of joining a nuclear alliance mhmm you know see what what's happening here so we have to make it more and more difficult for putin to even contemplate that that's why people are saying this is reckless this is irresponsible putin is actually making the world less safe for himself down the line either but he's thinking short term here he's thinking what can i do what do i actually have you can also destroy lots of infrastructure as he's doing you can use subversion you know we're worried about all of the undersea cables all these weird things happening you know off orkney or in the mediterranean or you know all these other things that are happening nord stream two pipelines other infrastructure there's all kinds of other things that you can do as well here it's not just you know again there's a civilian nuclear threat of blowing up you know one of the reactors now it's gotta be sure about where the wind turns and the wind blows and there's all kinds of things to you know factor in here but putin is definitely sitting around calculating with other people what can i do to turn this around i mean he still thinks that he can win this or in other words he can or he can end it in on his terms crimea donetsk luhansk kherson zaporizhzhia and you know capitulation or recognized as being part of russia or he can freeze it and then you know kind of figure out where it goes from there what other pressure he can put on i mean i'm sure he's confident he can get rid of zelensky and he can prevail over us i mean look the uk is going through prime ministers faster than i'm changing my socks so it's like he can you know prevail on the you know basically he can he can have an impact on the political scene in europe and elsewhere i mean again everyone's talking about winter coming and i know putin's thinking yeah great i've you know destroyed the infrastructure of ukraine worried about the winter well yeah but i mean look the other thing is that we have to start preparing i mean we have to start thinking about this we've got a wartime economy situation situation that's where we are we've got the home front to think about as well putin has declared war on us he did that on september thirtieth and so what he's done at other points as well he's just not paid attention but he pretty was pretty explicit in september thirtieth i mean go back and watch that speech and you know he is gambling that you know people will go back you know to basically taking russian gas and oil but it's not going to be that simple as well and do people and then you know the question has to be do we really kinda think he's gonna play fair after that when he's kind of also shown that he can leverage that it's such a complicated world it is complicated it's very complicated and it's never i mean this it feels like things are heating up like and china is very quiet right now because they're watching what happens i mean for president xi you know he's trying to consolidate his power even further after the party congress but he doesn't wanna look like he made a mistake by backing putin i mean he thought putin was also going to be in and out and ukraine would probably be open for massive chinese investment china was the largest investor in ukraine before the war largest single investor i mean the eu was bigger of course how do you hope the war ends in ukraine well i mean i i do hope it ends you know with a ceasefire and a negotiated solution but it has to be with russia compromising on something and that's not where we are right now do you think both sides might be willing to compromise most wars always end in that way i mean nobody's ever happy but they don't seem to either side like legitimately doesn't wanna compromise right now yeah because i mean look the thing is that for ukraine right now anything is a compromise at its expense right yeah fast devastation unbelievable casualty rates biggest refugee crisis since world war two russia's just said sorry this is our territory it's not just crimea i think there could have been a negotiation over that but you know donetsk and lukhandsk i mean we've got all kinds of formulas we've had all the way through history of you know putting things under a kind of guardianship receivership of territory the united nations all kinds of different ways of formulating that we could have easily been creative but russia's basically saying nope sorry we've taken this and any other any negotiation is just you recognizing this for us not doing more destruction i mean that is not the basis for negotiation and you know having you know kind of people come and just sort of laying those terms down is not a starting position i think russia is also you know in a in a dilemma of its own making now because putin has made it very difficult you know to compromise just by everything that he's said now for ukraine they've already won a great moral political and military victory it's just hard to see it right at the particular moment they've done what the finns did in the winter war which the finns were devastated by the winter war as well but they pushed them back now the finns lost a lot of territory they lost karelia and you know huge spheres of territory but they got to be finland and and now they're you know joining nato but they've been part of the eu the question is how to you know get ukraine to be ukraine and a success but you know is and that's the challenge now again they've already won psychologically politically militarily because putin hasn't succeeded in what he wanted to do but he has succeeded in completely and utterly devastating them and this is the kind of the old muscovite old russian imperial old servant mentality going all the way back to when the muscovites were the bagmen for you know the horde the for the mongols it was destruction you know you don't play with us we'll destroy you people talk about it as mafia but it's old you know all you have to go down is go and see tarkovsky's andrei rublev i mean i remember you know seeing that film when i was first as a student in moscow and just being woah this is so brutal i mean this is just unremittingly brutal because the whole point is that you show people who's the boss the destruction is the point of things as well because you know you are emphasizing your domination and that's what putin is doing right now he's saying okay you wanna go in a different direction so be it but i'm gonna make you suffer remember when hradakhovsky got out of the penal colony when putin let him out eventually mhmm he said he's suffered enough but he suffered for ten eleven years i don't think putin feels that ukraine has suffered enough at this point or we have suffered enough so there's a part of this invasion that's punishment for something yeah it's medieval i mean look we're all capable of the same things right there was all that destruction and that's what assad was like in syria like his father you destroy because you teach him a lesson and look britain did that in the colonial era i mean all the history of british colonialism is exactly the same i mean all the mau mau you know and kenya you know up until recent times brutality teaching people you know you have to teaching them a lesson you have to suffer the us did it i mean we did it with the native americans you know we did it all over the place you know as well this is kinda what big you know states do at different points in history it's just that you know russia has not moved on from that and we've learned some lessons later i hope we've fully internalized them of you know things that we've done you you know kind of the past united states we ideally are trying to do better and most of europe is trying to do better as well think about france and algeria you know again you know we can see this in many different settings but i think you know for putin right now he hasn't taught all of us sufficient a lesson i just i talked to hundreds of people in ukraine and the tough thing the inspiring thing is that there's a unity the tough thing is a lot of them speak intensely of hate towards not just russia but russians russians about how europeans felt about germany and germans at the end of world war two and generational hate like well i don't think that hate is gonna pass well it might it might well take a generation i mean i when when i was a kid in the seventies i went on exchanges to to germany and that was like you know thirty years more than thirty years after the end of the war my grandfather who'd fought in world war one wouldn't speak to my parents when they sent me on a then we hadn't fought in world war two we fought in world war one and he hated the germans and he and he did not want me going you know to germany as an exchange student he refused to meet you know kind of the german kid who you know came to stay at my house you know for example i mean it takes a long time to it takes a long time to get over that but but you do i mean and we have we have in europe and that was the whole point of you know all of that kind of exercise of european unity after world war two now the big challenge is what do we do with russia because a lot of people are talking about we can't have european security without russia other people saying we can't have a europe you know kind of with russia you know so how do we deal with this we've got to basically it's gonna be like japan and germany after world war two after this just the level of the atrocities that have been carried out as you said the level of hatred but we found a way of doing it now it a lot of it will require change on the part of russia as well and russians and really thinking about this i mean gorbachev before tried to deal in the late nineteen eighties with the black spots in with glasnost with openness and talking about russian history just kind of never sort of withered on the vine as time went on what gives you hope about the future well my hope comes into the fact that we've done things before that we've got ourselves out of tough times and we've overcome stuff and in people because i meet amazing people you just talked about hundreds of people that you've met within ukraine and you know people all think differently contexts and circumstances change and people can evolve some people get stuck putin's got stuck but people can evolve and you know i do think that if we all pull together and we've seen this in so many contexts we can find solutions to things just like we get back again to our discussion about scientists and just the kind of amazing breakthroughs of you know what we did on covid or done on you know kind of other diseases and things look there is some similarities there's a pathology around war and conflict years ago in the 1990s i worked on you know a lot of the projects that were funded by the carnegie corporation of the united states under the then presidency of david hamburg who was a scientist and actually did see a lot of parallels between the sort of like the pathology of disease and you know kind of the the pestilence you know conflict kind of idea and of course these you know parallels had to be very careful because you know they're not neat but there was kind of like an idea in there how do you sort of treat this how do you deal with this and we did come up with all kinds of of ideas and you know things that are still out there we've created institutions that have helped to keep the peace we just have neglected them allowed them to degrade just like the united nations and you know we've we've created problems inside of them like the veto power of the permanent powers on the un security council but we can change that you're just gonna have a will and i do think out there there are sufficient people with a will and we've just gotta get people mobilized i mean i'm always amazed by how people can mobilize themselves around a crisis remember winston churchill i don't quote all the time because i can never remember half his quotes but i do remember the one about never let a good crisis go to waste and i always think that that you know yeah that we should we shouldn't let this crisis go to waste and something else can come out of this just like in ukraine we've worried before about corruption in ukraine the influence of the oligarchs we've got our own oligarchs here in the us we need to you know deal with as well but this is a chance to do it differently yeah it really is a chance to do things differently and a part of that is young people i have to ask you and as young people i mean i'm feeling a bit on the older side now but i still feel i've got you know a bit of you know kind of youth within me yet they're at fifty seven i'm not that old but i'm not that young but we have to work together with younger and older people you remind me together in coalitions of you know across generations you remind me of of of kids who just graduated college and say and i i'm i feel old i'd say yeah no i don't actually feel old but it is a number age and you know when you know you kinda think about when i was i thought you don't like math yeah yeah i always like things like that yeah but i i find it interesting but you know when i was i remember when i was a little kid i kept thinking about the year two thousand and i thought oh my god i'll be dead i'll be thirty five yeah that's twenty two years ago you've overcome a lot of struggle in your life based on different reasons as you write about class being one of them your funny sounding accent being another or it's just representation of class but in general through all of that to be at the white house to be one of the most powerful voices in the world what advice would you give from grounded in your life story to somebody who's young somebody who's in high school and college thinking of how they can have a big positive impact on the world look we all have a voice right we all have agency we all actually have the ability to do something and you can you know start small in your local community or you know even in your own classroom just helping you know somebody else out or speaking up and advocating on behalf of things when i was about eleven years old i got involved with other kids on save the whales we had all this we were hardly greta thunberg but we you know we kind of got together in a kind of network writing to people and you know trying to raise money to you know help save the whales now actually the whales of the world are doing somewhat better i can't say that that was because of me and my network but you know it was kind of a way of organising and you know kind of joining in at a larger movement everybody can be part of something bigger the thing is it's all about working together with others and giving other people a chance as well i think you know one thing is that our voices have more impact when they're amplified they don't have to be the voices of discord or the voices of hate you know you've been you know trying to do this with your podcast you know kind of give people a voice give them a kind of platform and you know get them to join in with other people and you know one of the things that i've been trying to do is you know kind of go and talk to just as many people as i possibly can and say look you know we can all do something here we can all you know lend our voices to a cause that we care deeply about we can be kind to each other we can give other people a chance we can kinda speak out while we see that something is wrong and we can try to explain things to people what i'm trying to do at the moment is just explain what i've learned about things and hope that that helps people make informed judgments of their own and maybe take things further and learn something more it's like building up on the knowledge that i have to try to impart to others and everybody can do that different ways you can reach back yeah if you're fourteen help somebody who's seven if you're twenty one help somebody who's fourteen you know kind of in you know the kind of my age now i'm always trying to you know reach back and you know work with younger people listen to younger people help them out make connections for them listen to what they have to say about something try to incorporate that in you know things that i'm saying as well but the main point is that we've all got a voice we've all got agency and it always works better when we work together with other people but sometimes it can feel pretty hopeless it can feel i mean there's low points you you seem to have a kind of restless energy a drive to you were there low points in in the beginning when in your early days when you're trying to get the education where it may have not been clear to you that you could be at all successful yeah there always there always were i mean there were lots of points where i was just despondent but then you know i'd meet somebody who would just suddenly turn things around was this luck or was i out there looking for it you know sometimes you know you just if you're open and receptive to you know kind of hearing something from someone else i mean i you know there are often times where i felt so despondent you know in such a black mood i didn't think i'd be able to go on and then i'd have a chance conversation with somebody i i mean i once remember you know i was sitting on a bench it was probably eleven or twelve just crying my eyes out just really upset and an old lady just came and sat next to me put her arm around me said oh it's alright pet what's the matter you know it can't be that bad can it and it was just this human embrace it's like somebody you know just basically reaching out to me that snapped me out of it and i thought you know here's somebody just you know she didn't know who i was she just felt really bad that i was you know sitting you know crying and i mean i can't even remember what it was about anymore you know now it just seems inconsequential at the time i probably thought my life was at an end just you know sometimes people making eye contact with you in the street and saying something to you can kind of pull you out of something and you know it's kind of a i think you would just have to open yourself up to the prospect that not everyone's bad just like you were saying before that there's you know good in everybody even during you know that really difficult period of impeachment you know i was trying to listen very carefully to people and i thought look we always we still have something in common here we need to remember that you know kind of when people are kind of forgetting who they are or you know the context in their operating there's always something that can you know can pull you back again there's always that kind of thread so i'm sure you were probably attacked by a lot of people and you were still able to keep that optimism that you well i kept it into kind of perspective like when i was a kid i mean you know things are gonna be fine i got bullied you know kind of again and i try to understand why they're doing this one of the most amazing things that happened really on was my dad was a pretty incredible person and he would always open my eyes to something and i was getting bullied really nastily by a girl at school and my dad started asking me questions about her and one day my dad said we were gonna go for a walk and my town's very small remember it's very depressed really you know deprived area and we go to this housing estate public housing place that's not too far away from where i live and it's really you know kind of one of the most rundown places and an already rundown place my dad like knocks on the door and i said what are we doing dad and i see he says well we're going off to you know we're gonna visit somebody an old you know family friend i think they're even you know a distant relative knock on the door this old man answers the door and he's oh alfie my dad's name is alfalfie you know kind of fancy seeing you here haven't seen you come on in have a cup of tea what are you doing so i'm just walking past my daughter we're going for a walk and then suddenly i see that girl and she's in the kitchen and i'm thinking oh my god bloody hell you know british expression what's this and it turns out that dad had figured out who she was and he knew her grandfather and she was living with her grandfather and she'd been abandoned by her parents and she was living in you know pretty dire circumstances and she'd been getting raised by her grandfather and she was just miserable and the reason she was bullying me was to make herself feel better yeah and after that she never bullied me again i mean we didn't even talk because there was a connection made and suddenly she realized that her grandfather who was the only person she had knew my dad and there were some they were friends or they were even family some you know kind of relationship there i mean i i was a relative to half of north of england i had no idea how we were related you know everybody was some relative people have lived there for generations to get in this very small area and that turned things around so just remember you might have and that's kind of suddenly taught to me there's always a reason why somebody's doing something a lot of the times they're really unhappy with themselves sometimes there's something else going on in their lives sometimes they just don't know of any better and i shouldn't take it personally because i don't have a personal connection with half these people who are out there saying that they want this and that to happen to me well thank you for the kindness and the empathy you still carry in your heart i can see it through all that you must have gone through in the in the recent couple of years it's really inspiring to see that and thank you for everything you've done for the work you've written and for the work you continue to write and to do this seems like a really really difficult time for human civilization on a topic that you're a world expert in so don't mess it up no i know but that's how i'm saying everybody out there let's just let's just keep it together right yeah exactly just keep it together your words have a lot of power right now so it's it's a it's a really really tricky time yeah so thank you so much given how valuable your time is to sit down with me today it was an honor no thank you so much no it's a privilege and a pleasure to talk to you as well no thank you thanks for listening to this conversation with fiona hill to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you some words from john steinbeck power does not corrupt fear corrupts perhaps the fear of the loss of power thank you for listening and i hope to see you next time
