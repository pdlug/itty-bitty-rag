the following is a conversation with todd howard one of the greatest video game designers of all time he has led the development of the fallout series and the elder scrolls series including arena daggerfall morrowind oblivion skyrim and the future elder scrolls six and a totally new world in an upcoming game called starfield many of these have won game of the year awards and have been some of the most celebrated and impactful games ever made to me skyrim is quite possibly the greatest game ever and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the

living inside a video game that the future you designed can you give hints as to how one would escape if this was a video game how can a video game character escape to outside the video game are these things you don't consider when you design the game actually we do because in the kind of games that we make we want it to be as open as possible right so you know when you start a game you're always testing it what can i do what what would the game allow me to do and you check everything you try to pick up the you know the mugs you try every door you collide with everything like hey what are the rules of this world we try to do games where you know we say yes as much as possible that leads to some level of chaos but if you were stuck in a video game you would you would try everything and usually you're gonna find a door or a space where the designers didn't anticipate you piling all those crates up and getting over a wall that they didn't expect right so it's not a designed doorway out it's accidental unintended doorway out and it's a it's a happy bug you could like trim and show just get in the ocean and go till it's it just keep going it keep going right but the more realistic the game becomes the harder it is to find that door the the bigger the world the bigger the open world and then as we do it we learn they're gonna find a way so just don't try to pen them in usually we leave like this developer test cell yeah area in the game that we don't anticipate anyone will find and and they ultimately find it they only usually has crates of all the weapons in the game and things like that the little hints you drop now will just drive people mad which is something i enjoy deeply so skyrim pcs have at times hilarious dialogue what does it take to build a good npc dialogue the main thing is to make them reactive a lot of times when you write characters for movies or things like that you want to make that character interesting for themselves right what's their story and there are some characters like that that the player definitely cares about but the best characters are the ones that react to you mhmm so you'll find a lot of people love our guards and the guards are written almost purely to be reactive hey nice tie i like your jacket do this cool watch you know hey what'd you do and so that hey you're the man as you walk by that makes them interesting or the way they react to something that you do lydia in skyrim who everybody loves i'm sworn to carry your burdens that's a generic line that all of the you know house carls have and it just kinda lands when she says it why does it land what do you what do you do and did you anticipate it with land it's a slight snarkiness in that particular read of it and you're asking her to do something and she's reacting to you what about the the trade off between maybe the randomness and the scripted nature of the dialogue like is there any room for randomness of the dialogue tree oh absolutely we tend to write them in stacks with you know it it it's a it's a very small think of it as a small state machine that just says okay this is what's happening here's a random list of things i could say to that and then some of that plays out in ways you don't anticipate but we look at the things what are the players doing that we could have the characters respond to that they don't expect you know jumping on tables or stealing stuff or you know sneaking in in the middle of the night or those kind of things the more that we can do the more reactive and interesting the characters appear and these state machines how big are these things are these individual to the individual characters it's just fascinating how you design state machines is it just a just a giant you would i would think of the ai as one big one yeah oh so for for sort of everybody so there's an ai there's a manager for all the people yeah and one of the things that people manager right right nice one of the things that makes what we do particularly unique is and this is a trade off for what people are seeing because a lot of it's not on the screen but we're using cycles to run this which is we're thinking about everybody in the whole world mhmm all the time the ones that are further away at a much less tick rate they go into low but we know if they wanna walk across the world and we're running every quest at the same time yeah whereas in other open world games you start an activity the rest of the world's gonna shut down so that they can really make that as impactful we're i i really prefer that the rest of it's going on it's more of a simulation that we're building so when those things collide that's where it gets the most interesting and so we're running all of those people and understanding where they wanna go and their cycles and what they wanna do and the ones that are closer to you we just update a lot more it's one way to think about it i mean that's really fascinating that's something that people had they were wondering about to what degree it's possible to run the world without you so there is a feeling to role playing games that you're the central you're at the center of the world and the whole world rotates around you as it does in normal life like when we walk around there's a when you forget yourself you start to take yourself very seriously like you are the center of the world you forget that there's eight billion people on earth and you forget that they have lives that's actually a sobering realization that they all have really interesting life stories and they have their worries they suffer in different complicated ways and yet when you play a role playing game there's a i mean both computationally and from a storytelling perspective you wonder if the world goes on without you like if you come back if you take a break and you come back is there still a bustling town that now has a history since you have last visited so to what degree can you create a world that goes on without you or goes on at the same time as you do your thing whatever the heck you're doing we don't prioritize the stuff you can't see so it's more like an amusement park if you study like the design or level designers did this how do they build disney world in these places so it still exists for you the player so it is fairly you know when you're gonna come in this is what you're gonna see the shops are in the front you're gonna do this it's just for us to make it far more believable and get some more emergent behavior that not just make that sort of the verisimilitude of what you're in for that moment but you you buy it all mhmm i always say like you know we gotta do the little things so that you buy the reality of the virtual world you're in so we wanna do something crazy you know when a dragon lands or a death law comes out of the wasteland or those kind of things that you it has the impact to you as the viewer that it would to the people in the world okay but still you're simulating stuff that's close to you it is a bit of a simulation going on oh absolutely yes and and so that creates some interesting dynamics then and the stuff that we're looking at in the future you know our plan is to push that even more to think about how these things exist in the world first then we do some of this but even more so in the future to say how do these things exist take like a faction in the world what is their role in the world as opposed to just their role is for the player to join it go through a bunch of quests and become the head of the faction you know think a little bit deeper about the simulation and what would the mages guild be doing in a fantasy world or the fighters guild be doing in a fantasy world versus just sign up do quests get gold and so that when you show up to that mages guild it's a bustling guild full of stuff going on it's not just that it's bustling is that they feel rooted in it they don't feel like a storefront for come here do quests get experience is that one of the essential components of randomly generated worlds so when i think back to daggerfall as gigantic world or when i first played it i thought like i mean you're just struck by the the the the immensity of it right the the immensity of the possibility when you're young and you look into your future it's it's wide open any you can do anything and that's what the what daggerfall felt like the openness was gigantic and daggerfall is interesting coming off arena where arena does the same thing but daggerfall in many ways is bigger despite focusing on an area because of how the density of okay this is how this is how much physical game space we'll do for these villages and towns and it does feel endless even though you're looking at a map that has constraints and daggerfall actually was a touchstone for us going into starfield for how we do the planets because there is there's a different kind of gameplay experience when you just wander outside a city in daggerfall then you know follow a quest line and go through go to this place and it's completely handcrafted and everything around every corner we've kinda placed like skyrim you know starfield's a bit more like daggerfall and if you want her outside the city we're gonna be generating things and you kinda get used to that game flow different than we've done before and fun in a different kind of way we'll talk about starfield so just for people who don't know and how dare you for not knowing but we're with agatha we're talking about the elder scroll series that started sort of talking about the big titles within the series started with arena in ninety four daggerfall in ninety six i didn't look up the years before this this is depressing or or or awesome so all of these games brought hundreds probably for some of them thousands of hours of joy for me so arena daggerfall morrowind oblivion and skyrim so i don't remember arena being that open world well it's all the provinces it follows kind of the same pattern it just doesn't have all the number of villages and places that daggerfall has while daggerfall focuses on the iliac bay area arena does it all it just changes the scale in terms of you know one block on the map equals this much space there is something that i mean i i'm speaking to anecdotal experience but i i just remembered feeling wide open daggerfall it definitely was yes in the way irina didn't i don't remember maybe maybe because arena it was so cool to have the just the role playing game aspect you're focused on the items and the character development you daggerfall has a lot more depth particularly in the character system that's what it introduces all of the skills and those kind of things arena it's actually it's a game i love and it's very very elegant if you look at the first one where it's just an x xp based system do this get xp level up very classic role playing game daggerfall digs deep into who's your character how you're gonna develop it what are your skills there's advantages there's disadvantages and the environment going full three d from arena which is actually a two and a half d doom style engine that i i agree with you that daggerfall feels like there's more possibilities when you're playing it were you able to like look up the sky in daggerfall yep my my memory is full three d yeah it's so that's what full three d means and then you can go outside the city you can walk outside the city you can do that in arena too but it it looks more fakey right it's all gonna be a flat plane here comes things and then a dungeon entrance is a you know eight bit here comes a little flat coming at the camera so before we go to the end in the middle so from starfield of fallout and the elder scrolls series let's go to the very beginning what's the origin story you know what let's even go before then what's when's the first time you remember the thing that made you fall in love with video games well i think it's partly you know my age coming up with the arcades and playing you know space invaders at the pizza place and then pac man really it's interesting about video games and what pac man did for video games where it popularized them in a way that was just insane at the time had a song had a cartoon had all of the things nintendo comes along so it was always part of you know i think if you were a kid growing up then it was such a newness to playing things like that i remember being in fifth grade when the trs eighty was brought into the classroom and there was a star trek game and i was enamored with it and they were gonna start teaching some rudimentary programming like okay would you like to know how this is made and i was i was hooked i was like i need to figure out how to make this stuff and so i was a you know self taught programmer and my whole goal was to write my own video games and you know by sixth seventh grade i had written my own much better star trek clone for the yeah of course apple two and i really enjoyed programming on the apple two then and that i think was the right level of like complexity you know at that age where you could kind of you were always learning but you could still understand a lot of the problem set for like this is when i wanna get on the screen and i was also into art so i did a lot of art and i did a lot of programming and i was always making games that was my hobby from the time i was you know ten or twelve what what was to you involved in making games like how did you think of it was it from a graphics perspective like what shows up on screen was it how it makes you feel was it about the story was it the text based stuff and the dialogue and the prompting like what what like what does it mean to create a video game at that young age to to you well it was a way of experiencing things that i couldn't myself so you know if you're playing dungeons and dragons at the time too where you you really feel even pen and paper these are like like they feel somewhat in quotes real to you as you're playing them you're very invested in your character and what you're doing and then i love the games the wizardry and ultima that were able to bring that to a computer so i could you know do it on my own time it was very very real to me i'd sit in my bedroom and then go to bed and think about it and then oh no i have to go to school i wanna come home and figure out how to how to do this problem in the game and so whatever i was creating was something that i was excited about at the time i made a raiders of the lost ark game like with graphics and everything yeah it was so it was usually you know made a miami vice game made a gru the wanderer game made a traveler game i may and but every time i was doing it i wanted to figure out a new method on the apple two of pulling it off graphically whether that was editing character sets to get graphics in different formats or how can i enable the secret double high res mode it had or just things like that where it became kind of this limitless what can i make this do and and i had some friends who were doing the same thing and then you get into who can impress each other and i was kind of middle of the pack i would say and then but but again this was the time where they're bringing computers into the school and the apples come into the school and the teachers are learning it because they have to teach the students but then i was i would say i was part of a group of students that were like way past that and it was very much of a self taught you know how how do you make this thing dance i'd like to ask a strange question so at that time a lot of people consider you one of if not the greatest game designer creator of all time you were middle of the pack then did you have a sense that this would be your life and you would also be creating you know the greatest games ever not not in the slightest no i don't think anybody but i was very much like that was my dream at a at that age but you don't think that that's a job you know and the as i got older i was really going through college and and i the com even the computer classes then weren't where i wanted them to be so i still kinda doing my own stuff and i ended up getting a business degree and then interviewing for some jobs like finance jobs so well i guess i should do this to make money and i can keep doing this on the side and i remember i actually got to like the final level of like this corporate finance job at circuit city mhmm nice and they turned me down and i was like fuck them i'm just gonna go make video games so thank you circuit city yeah i remember circuit city i think they went bankrupt actually they were based in richmond i was going to school close to there and so so what what's the origin story of you joining bethesda softworks at the time so i had gotten wayne gretzky hockey three for christmas for my girlfriend at the time who's now my wife i was in college and i noticed that it was you know in rockville maryland and oh that's on my way home over christmas break back to william and mary where i went to college and and i was at this point committed like this is what i wanna do so i'm just gonna drive by and knock on the door which is what i did so i i drove by and knocked on the doors martin luther king day ninety three and someone came out and met me and said well maybe what and i well i'm i'm in college i'm talking about when i'm out of school i'm like okay well contact us then and i will say i was i was i would contact them every once in a while i did work for a small software company right out of school down in that area of williamsburg and still would contact bethesda arena had just come out mhmm so then we're in ninety four arena had just come out and i loved it so i was in the sports games i like the hockey stuff they were doing a basketball they did a basketball game yeah i'm just looking at they did a lot of they did like six sports games six but that's the rid of iron ten games yeah six of them sports games and and c double a basketball hockey league simulator simulator yep so it was really like sports gridiron which is like the first kind of physics based football game at the time and there's a famous story with electronic arts trying to do madden and then hiring bethesda before my time to make madden because they were struggling and when i started at bethesda i remember the owner had john madden's oakland raiders playbook nice in his office like oh can i see that and i love sports right so i still play madden to this day i love it so there's an alternate reality where i made sports games yeah yeah absolutely i i wanted to make i wanted to make like the ultimate college football game well it's always like you know it's like music you probably listen to lots of type of music like you don't play every time i think of open worlds as fundamentally different well sure no like source of happiness entertainment storytelling world gaming than than matter i mean it just because i love both i love both worlds but they're two totally different experiences just like when you might watch a movie you might be in the mood for lord of the rings one day and then you want some other i don't know competitive show or game show or something like that or watch football on tv right you watch football on tv but then i wanna watch get really into game of thrones yeah so i think all those things have validity and actually one of the first things i worked on when i started bethesda was ncaa basketball road to the final four too so that was kind of an external project was came in like hey you you know sports get this game done and then went on to but they were doing everything i loved it was like this is where i have to work they're doing like the terminator science fiction stuff i love that they're doing these open world role playing games like i love that and they're doing sports like this i have to work here yeah so started there and you loved i loved it yeah so when i came in it had just come out and they were doing the cd rom version so cd roms aren't even out yet oh it used to be floppy disks that's probably when what was the re arena reversed them in the basement we had the disk replicators right so arena was not released on floppy it was released yes i believe it's six floppy disks six floppy disks maybe it was eight yeah but in those days the number of floppy disks was very very important to what the money you were making so you know if you wanna do a big huge game like well that's just too many discs so the cd rom became this this jumping off point for the whole industry where oh it's unlimited data by the way i played arena so that that was of course attained legally as one does alternate means by alternate means right on floppy on floppy disks and that was that was such an incredible as as as you as you probably have seen interacting with a large number of people it's a it's a whole world it's a world that you escape to in the way like your favorite book like lord of the rings you it was just some it was it was unlike anything else it was incredible it's probably i mean of course as people say it's the first game you play is the most is the one that really sentimentally means the most to you that's i think the first role playing game i played and it was just changed everything was arena it was arena yeah i i think daggerfall is what i really kinda really played especially because like you you said the character development was really rich but just like that you can be feel like you traveled to this whole other world that's less about entertainment like a shooting game right and more about a world it felt like it's a world like like like you're literally there you can travel there you can live there you actually feel like that person versus like a pac man like like an arcade fun entertaining advent adventure game so so you joined you made it what did you work on first there i worked well everyone did a bunch of stuff so i worked on the basketball game really just to get it out the door and terminator future shock so we were doing future shock and daggerfall at the same time they were developing a new engine so it was one of the first three d engines the x engine there were there were a bunch of guys from denmark actually it was like a there's like a big danish demo scene in those days on the pc and so a bunch of the top programmers there well look this is not big this is not a big company maybe there's twenty people in development and we were doing both daggerfall and the new terminator and so daggerfall was a bit more again behind the terminator game so i was one of the main people on the terminator team and i don't know things kinda worked out i've i very quickly i don't know why like i quickly became the producer and i was making levels and doing all these things and it was it was awesome and i like looking back now i can understand it better but at the time i didn't appreciate it which is no one quite owned the terminator license it was in like this limbo legally so there was no one to tell us what to like no you can't do that so we would you know pick apart the movies and oh how does he mention the gun he wants and the wattage of the laser and all these things and so future shock is a game that i still love today it does a lot of things that if you go back and look at it we're frankly still doing like it's a large open world postapocalyptic you know landscape height map with instanced objects all over it and that is still a lot of how we build our worlds what's an instanced object it's you know some games every you know wall or building is kind of unique in its data whereas we would just build you know these little husks of buildings and then place them all over the place so the memory and the way you render it is much more optimal so that allows you to build a bigger world and more build a bigger world much faster and not you know not every single version of that building isn't its own unique architecture that is gonna take up memory and processing speed etcetera etcetera so you're they're very much feeling the computational constraints of the system when you're creating these open world and you know what that's the thing then you see some of it now but in those times i do feel like every year the technology moved and maybe it's because same thing we're like that might age at that time where every year somebody was coming up with some new method mhmm or some new game system and it was every year that innovation innovation innovation and then you know three d acceleration comes along and then these things come along and then hd comes along and it is true that as time goes on there is visually a diminishing return in terms of what you're able to do on the screen and it there's a ton of work that goes into it now because just rendering this cup to the perfect shine and material and roughness and how does the global illumination off this wall like it's a ton of work yeah but you can pretty much do what you want now if you wanna put the time in whereas then okay you can't do everything you want so pick your battles really carefully and it technically you couldn't do what you want if that makes sense mhmm how much trade off is there now in how much effort you put into the the the realism of the graphics versus the story and actually not even how much effort you put in but is there a trade off in the experience the feel of the game in terms of realism and story usually we will start with let the player have as much agency and do as many things as they can as possible and we will sacrifice some graphic fidelity for that some speed for that you know we could make a game that you know our traditionally our games are you know we're okay with thirty frames a second as long as it looks really good and the simulation's running and all of those things so we'll we'll sacrifice some of that fidelity for the player experience in in this the kind of things that that i do but from like a manpower standpoint the graphics programmers work on graphics the artists work on art and we have a you know awesome team of artists and designers and writers and programmers it's usually where we find as time goes on the amount of art time that it takes to create a cup compared to what it used to be that has increased so we do use like most people use you know art outsourcing as well so that we're not we still relatively compared to our industry and what we're doing have smaller teams what about the experience of the beauty of the graphics so like one of the most amazing things about skyrim and maybe you could say that about some of the other games but for me skyrim is the outdoor when you step outside yeah it's the outdoor scenery so what does it take to create the feeling especially of that being outdoors of nature and just like lost in the beauty whatever it is when you go hiking and you feel the awe of it how do you create that awe is that graphics what is that it's a lot of graphics it's a lot of mood we just talk about it in terms of tone and those are again going back to my previous comment the graphics are very very important to us because and and we always push them because when you're doing the kind of things we do where you step into a virtual world it does have to have that moment of wow this is this feels real i've never experienced this and it's okay i think it's okay to let just like the time settle meaning you step out how does the wind sound how are the trees moving how are the clouds moving i enjoy strolling and watching the sunset you know how does it land over the water like it doesn't have to be like hey let's go let's finish a quest let's go kill things let's figure out the next step let's level up like i like the quiet moments a lot and i think you when you play our games you can tell we spend a lot of time on them then you watch like the weather roll in i think that's just part of being being that character being that person in that space yeah the i saw that there's a mod that removes all enemies i've been meaning to do to do that to just do like a live stream where for hours walk around skyrim just and then answer questions and so on that just feels that's a completely stress free environment it's just you are just like you said in this moment in time and it's so incredible it it feels as incredible as going hiking or some something like that but in another it's a totally different place like an like iceland or something like that mhmm this this this whole other surreal ethereal place it's yeah it's incredible how you kind of create that so graphics is a part of that but also letting it the temporal aspect of that like the wind the the the rustling sound and look and all of that the soundscape is really really important in the sky we spend a lot of time on the sky because it's taking up much more of the screen than a lot of people give credit for what about the rendering the openness of it like how do you is that there's a lot of level of detail streaming work and if you know nowadays it's getting more common like frankly the systems are built better for it mhmm hard drive speed is really prioritized like they're so blazing fast you take skyrim and oblivion and the fallouts of that three sixty era it's a it was a lot of time spent on how do we get all this data streaming in as you move and then levels of detail so you can see all the way but not you know crush the processor you know what let's even still step back because you mentioned tone you mentioned tone a lot mhmm what do you mean by tone it's all of it together if you look at i think you can flip through let's just take fantasy you know you can sort of look at a couple images or things and know how does lord of the rings different from game of thrones that is different than you know a a thurian like excalibur or your you know sci fi channel you know series of the month kind of thing and so finding that what's gonna make it kinda unique and usually i lean on something that is grounded in reality for what it is and then have lesser kind of fantastical things at least at the start and then they they kinda build so even when we do starfield i mean it's a science fiction game there are laser guns and spaceships fly around and shoot each other and blah blah blah blah but it's grounded in you can look at it and say oh okay this is kind of an extension of things as we view them today in space and we sort of take the same approach with fallout where admittedly things can get admittedly things can get even a little bit crazier the longer you're developing fallout content so just to linger on this so tone starts at or the defining the tone starts at creating a realistic experience like you feel like i could walk into this and this feels like life what's their technology level like even for a fantasy world like is magic how prevalent is it or are they making weapons and things and armor is it for utility is it for decoration how do they live their lives does this feel like a place that you believe that has some grounding in our reality whether that's historical or near future or that it's grounded in some some semblance of the reality that you and i understand so that it can feel it's also making it feel a little bit welcoming like okay i understand this is that art or science so like what how do you know when he feels welcoming and and everything fits in his ground i don't know i mean it's i guess it's personal taste some people like things that are weirder that have more fantastical from the get go even a game like morrowinds where we get into some more fantastical things it intentionally starts a little more grounded you know there's a very classic and medieval looking town that you come into but you look just beyond it her mushroom trees and giant insects and things like that so in skyrim when you put a dragon in it what are your thoughts about dragons and tone how does that fit into a tone that's a great question the it's a ridiculous question but yeah i just love dragons i wanna bring it up no no no these are the things that we we debate with do we include a dragon why didn't you include a dragon in daggerfall that's what i wanna know i think there's dragon there's dragonlings they're hard to do dragons are hard to do so when you start skyrim say hey look you know dragons are gonna be a theme you start start visually i think yeah they're you know you can make the argument that dragons existed okay what would they look like how close to dinosaurs would they be or what would they and ours are less i believe they're less fantastical looking in general they look like beasts that could exist in that world and then how we introduce them it's kind of a little bit of a slow you know role in skyrim and that the people in the world are reacting to the dragons appearing and that somewhat you know mirrors you want something that mirrors the player experience as well that says back to you like hey no these are this is have you heard this someone saw a dragon that's what daggerfall is there isn't there mentions of dragons or something because i remember i remember being sure that there's dragons in daggerfall as i'm playing it and i'm searching pretty sure well is there a dragon in daggerfall there's dragonlings in daggerfall to my memory look i guess someone will probably correct me like actually there is a dragon here but i'm pretty sure they're sort of they're not yeah and then game i did redguard which we bring back a it takes place beforehand so we have a dragon there in that game and that was unique to that at the time yeah just a brief tangent on that i thought redguard was a really really good game i played it as and again you don't you know just you you forget stuff but i remember getting i guess it was the first in the elder scrolls series to put it in into that world but it was like an adventure game it remind me of another game i really love like prince of persia that was the ins one of the inspirations prince of persia is one of my favorite games like i mean okay i i apologize if i'm forgetting but you can like jump in buildings and stuff like there's a jumping there's a dynamic like airy nature like it's a like parkland type of situation yeah it was an incredible game what why do you think let me ask sort of a a dark question why do you think that game was a flop one of one of the future not a dark question yeah it was well a lot of reasons game game that i love and really got us going on a handcrafted world so we're coming off of daggerfall morrowind is sort of in design and then you know part of our development teams broke up to do different things the game would that did battlespire and redguard was my game and i wanted to do something a little more ultima feeling handcrafted world i really like things that blend up genres so i know it's in the adventure game category but it really does a lot of things you know it's it's a it's a love letter to prince of persia there's a little raiders of the lost ark in it there's a lot of ultima in it and really see what we could do with the engine but it's very much i think plays like it woulda had a much better home on say playstation or xbox this predates xbox right where it's a much more like constantly tomb raider had come out so do you see those influences of tomb raider on that game and three d effects cards had just come out and so okay we can do and it was the last i think it's one of the last like dos games in a windows world so it i think it missed kind of a technology window as well as ultimately not what people wanted from us you know and i felt i was really kind of the the company let me make that game and it it was a big flop battlespire hadn't done well the company was in a really bad shape and i felt really like personally responsible like they let me do this creative thing it didn't do what we needed it to do and now we're in a very very bad situation company almost went out of business and that's when it got reformed with zenimax media and robert altman came in and we were starting more when we had just sorta started and it was sort of that whole experience that made you sorta realize someone says to you okay you're gonna get another shot mhmm and that's where you're like okay we're gonna make morrowind and make the biggest best rpg we can make we know what the audience wants from us we know what we could do building a world so there's like callbacks to how we built the world in redguard morrowind is a large scale handcrafted but if you were to put it you know pixel per pixel with daggerfall you wouldn't even see morrowind like because daggerfall is so big but the impact of playing it i think is in many ways equal but different just you personally psychologically did you have doubt about yourself from from the performance of redguard like do i even do i know what it is to of course where where do you get the how'd you overcome that i i don't know i would say this honestly i enjoy it so much mhmm you know like i i'm so warm i'm so heads down like that becomes for better or worse like my life yeah and it's just something that i wanna play so much it becomes like there's a little bit you get a little obsessed with it no but i mean you love redguard right so like doesn't that mean isn't there a kind of self doubt about do i know what it takes to create a great game well no i think redguard's a great game right so you were sure even if it wasn't if you're gonna debate like do i like that game it's about finding an okay so i love redguard yeah and the people who play it it it won a bunch of awards and it did you know it like critically was a pretty good game did not sell and the reason for that again like we probably made this the wrong type of game and we missed a technology window we also thought it was very conservative we're gonna do this so my main takeaway was i'm not gonna be conservative again i'm gonna swing for the fences and we've had you know there'll be some rough edges in swinging for the fences and shooting for the moon we'd rather do that and land where we land than be very very conservative in what we're putting out there you you've mentioned just referencing this game on the reddit ama that long time ago during redguard the lead programmer made me made all the buildings hop up and down after you played for ten minutes just to mess with me just a on a curious tangent what what's involved with programming an open world game so so we talked about we will talk about design and so on but specifically the programming because i think this question came from what are some interesting sticky bugs that you've encountered throughout your life in creating these games and this is one of them that you mentioned so what are some of the challenges of programming these open world games i mean there are different flavors of them right your gtas will have different issues than you know the ubisoft games versus our games i can sort of you know speak to ours which is you wanna build systems right because they're gonna they're gonna play the game for a very long time as well which we've learned and you can't go through and touch everything by hand per se mhmm so you have to rely on some systemic level of creation and a lot of systems that are robust enough so that when they touch another one things aren't breaking apart so there's like a what are the major systems is there like the physics of the game the engine of how like stuff yeah like yeah the physics the motion and maybe how light is rendered and all that kind of stuff right so you have the rendering mhmm right of like okay this is how i'm gonna render the data that i have so a lot of people confuse engines with rendering i mean they're they're combined obviously but there's the data you're gonna give to a renderer which is the thing you know the audience you know that draws the pixels on the screen so there's a most of the engine is is how are you gonna bring in that data and give it to the renderer to to draw it so you have that whole system of walking through the world feeding in the data and and drawing it you then obviously have the physics and the interactivity what are the things that are there just to be drawn and what are the things there that are meant to be interact with and touched we put a big premium on the ones that can be interacted with and touched whether it's flowers whether the trees move whether you can sleep on the sofa sit in this chair pick up all this stuff bake bread blah blah blah you then have the ai which loops in the stuff we talked about earlier in terms of processing everybody and combat systems which is a lot of what and the people end up doing combat systems on top of that ai how do they react to those types of things and then how how do they look at the things that can be interacted with one of my favorite things is when npcs will go pick up weapons in the world which you don't see in other games and the first time you see it in one of ours it's like very unexpected mhmm you can drop like a crazy weapon be in a fight and an npc runs over picks it up and uses it on you it's not something you would expect but i love that stuff and that's integrated into a larger system the ability to pick up a the mpc picking up so it's not like a little quirk that's hard coded in it's part of a bigger system they they have their own ai for scanning the environment and that's one of the rules hey is there a weapon that is better than the one i have i'm gonna go get it now we do lock off if it's in a chest and that's treasure we left for the player but it's in particular because what you don't want we actually had this problem it started in oblivion i believe which is set up a level hey let the enemies go pick up the you know weapons if they're better so we make a level and go in and wow all of the enemies are armed to the teeth and there's no treasure for the player because the enemies went and took all the good weapons and he's like okay they don't take those they take the ones that are dropped yeah by other npcs or the player that's such a fascinating world of of the design and the experience for the mpc because in part that experience is defines the experience of the player so how they interact with their environment defines how you how the player experiences their environment is there a room for further and further development of the ai that controls the mpc sure we're always iterating on it and again as we look in the future it's more about us finding those more reactivity to the player and also understanding their roles in the world so they're not just there they're not just there for the player to as a signpost for the player but they're reacting to the player but what about you know some of the richest experiences we have with people is like the chaos of it the pull the push and pull the unpredictability is there something i don't know if you've been following but the the the quick amazing development of language models the neural network natural language processing systems dialogue systems do you think there's some possibility of using sort of these incredible neural nets that can have open ended dialogue basically chat bots yep i've seen some incredible demos i do think it's coming i don't know when yeah and there's a little bit of a question like what's ready for real deployment and release versus hey let's use that to generate some things that is then static that we're giving to the players versus yeah it's generated on the fly but it's definitely coming it's definitely coming and i think you'll see it in in the types of games that we do it has great you know application i love the idea that you'll be using that to design different npcs and then testing if they're if they're good enough if they're like a little too crazy you don't want like the the super right but if we go back to it being reactive some of that bot stuff you know it's pretty it's incredible it's then translating that into voice and then is that being done by the client is that being done on a server is it baked into the game there's like different flavors of it so there's still computational challenges like how do you actually make that happen right well what about oh in in terms of creating the feeling of an nvc what's the role of voice actors and awesome yeah we we work with a ton of voice actors and they bring so much to it and and that's the thing they you know we can write some stuff and and the best ones get in there and make it so much better or even ad lib things and so we we do a lot of voice recording and we used to do it kind of like at the end of the project and now we do it throughout we start really early and we just start recording so we're recording for years and years literally probably three years four years so part of the actual experience of the recording will help define the characters and the tone of the game right and we'll go back sometimes and hey we really like this we want more of this let's write let's do another session or hey we don't think this character is actually working we want you to do you're gonna be someone else now sorry that got cut do you ever try to sort of imagine that people fall in love with the characters with the npcs i do like i mean do they get really attached to the oh yeah i mean i've done it in games these are like close friends right like you can like you miss them a hundred percent isn't that part of the game like whenever i'm playing a game and there is you know if there's like a friendship option or make friends or a romance thing i i find those moments really i enjoy them i find them pretty impactful emotionally to what we're doing and so we've done a little bit of it it's one of the things that we actually have pushed in starfield so we have a number of companions but for them we go you know i won't say super complex romantic but but more complex relationships than we've had in terms of not just some you know state of they like you or they don't like you but they can be they can be in love with you mhmm and dislike something you did and be pissed at you temporarily and then come back to loving you oh so that that relationship status if it's complicated that that they're they're existing in that gray area it's complicated we're not dating or just or or well it's in a lot of games you know previous stuff you just work your way up they like you more and more and more and more and now you're in a relationship now you're in and you and when you make them upset you drift out of like it never happened you know you drift out of it whereas we wanted one where okay we can be in a relationship and yeah we've committed to each other in some way but i just did something that really made you angry yeah and as opposed to just drifting out of that status you're in a temporary i don't like what you did state wow so some greater degree of complexity in the relationship with the company a little bit a little bit a little bit i was talking about i don't wanna oversell that part but sure i my point is i think those things where you meet a character in a game and you do spend time with them a companion in a game and it leads to romance you know myself and others and i find a lot of players those moments are really really impactful and special to them because they did put in the time mhmm that's another thing that i always come at it with which is when people don't play video games they sometimes think like oh that's i don't know that's a waste of time or that's not real that's not like you're not getting a lot out of that like well you haven't really experienced it in the way that you can because these moments that i spent in games not not the ones i made other ones when i was growing up or even now those are that is important time to me mhmm like i love those moments i felt really like proud of what i accomplished and we want people to have that in our games and the fact that they've they have had those experiences and we hear from them and how important it is to them it's like no this is this is really really special yeah it's it's i mean from a from a game design perspective i wonder if you can honor the time you spent together with the game because you know sometimes there's a heartbreak at the end of the game like when you're when you when you leave a game there's a yeah it's a really complicated relationship actually because when when you leave a game it's almost like leaving a romantic partner because it's like you spent so much meaningful time together and there's a sense in which it was it was ephemeral like it right this this is not this thing happen yeah it didn't really happen it was good it was like you went to vegas you got drunk and stuff but like and now life goes on i wonder if there's a way to sort of always carry that with you i mean i guess with words you can kinda share with others like it's weird i don't like now that we're in the age where you have achievements and you can look at your library and see your hours and games like that's like it's almost like a scrapbook now like i wish one of my wishes was like i wish i had that achievement list for everything like back to the late seventies like every game you play right when yeah yeah like do you i mean that's one of the cool things with xbox like we're moving towards that direction it'd be cool to be from like childhood the first time you play a video game it will actually tell you what is the first game you but you know what yeah kids today they will have that they will have that and see but you could look back and see oh my god i put a thousand hours in direfall what is the first save save was nineteen ninety seven last save man i don't know golden axe maybe i'm trying to think what was the first game i've ever played no it's probably commodore sixty four games yeah yeah arcade games okay you mentioned starfield what is starfield and what's the origin story of this game we had always wanted to do something where you explore space you know the explore space role playing game so take the kind of games that we make and give it a little bit of a different spin and you know the other games that i love there was a pen and paper rpg i love traveler is one of the first games i made for the apple two didn't ever i never finished it right i'm just doing it on my own and i love this game starflight was one star control two was a game that i loved sundog was a big one in the apple two days that a lot of people don't know that i loved and so a lot of us in the studio felt it was time to do something new you know we're going between elder scrolls and fallout and going back and forth and i mean we love that but hey we've always wanted to do this explore the galaxy science fiction game you know now is the time to do that and that's a brave move so follow us post apocalyptic on a single planet mhmm you know elder scrolls series is on a single planet so this is going out into the open world of many star systems many planets i saw that it's thinking about a hundred star systems and a thousand planets available to explore what is that world of stars and planets like well you mentioned daggerfall we go back to some of that well the first we did it was how are we gonna render a planet like pull it off for the player like can we or do we have to sort of do it where you can't land on all of them where you're landing in a very controlled small world space that we you know kind of craft and you would have a very limited set of those if you go back to tone like well that's probably the wrong tone and how can we say yes like i wanna land land on that ice ball so it started we started the game right after fallout four so two thousand sixteen and the first thing we did was can you know how can we have a system to generate these planets and make them look you know i'll say reasonable as opposed to you know fractally goop what's the what's the technical definition of goop fractally goop fractally goop you've probably seen a lot of like simulations whether they're space things or landscape things where using fractals and just the landscape does not look real it just this is like highs and lows and it's muddy and so we did find a way we came up with a way had prototyped of of building tiles like large tiles of landscape the way we would usually build them we kinda generate them offline hand do some things and end up with these very realistic looking tiles of landscape and then built a system that wraps those around a planet and blends them all together and we had pretty successful results with that and so we thought yeah we could we could do this and so there was a big design kind of problem to solve in terms of well what's fun about landing on a planet where there's potentially nothing because there's a lot of planets and moons if you kind of write in reality that well there's nothing on them except resources and so we spend a lot of time figuring out okay let's just lean in on that can a be a lonely experience as long as we tell the player here's what's there here are the resources that are there go find them but i equate it to that moment of we said about listening to the wind go and watching the sunset and i do think there's a certain beauty to landing on a strange planet being somewhat the only person there building an outpost and we are modeling all of the systems because that's how we like to do things so you can watch whatever that gas giant or moon it will rotate and go and sunrise sunset and all of those things that you would expect and it's it's all really happening and most people probably won't notice or appreciate all of that but i think it gives them the ability to say i wanna go do that and see that on that place as long as we tell them hey the quest leads over here here's where the handcrafted content is that you would expect and then here's more of the open procedural planet experience so you you're long answer i don't know if i answered your question there's no alright questions are stupid and the answers are brilliant so they're that's how this works so this is the world's most immense simulator of the human condition of loneliness because i can't imagine a more lonely experience i mean you put it that way i don't i don't know that was the goal but just on a planet alone i just i i that must be i mean the a deep embodiment of what loneliness is like i mean it's the both the on the like when you hike alone there's a there's a deep loneliness to that it's like it's humbling that this thing will last much longer than you it's been here way before you is it the line from the moon landing beautiful desolation it's buzz aldrin is it beautiful desolation is that what you said think so beautiful desolation well something like that but that's just words there's a feeling to it and you want that feeling to be real you just hear there's some resources here i just feel like it'll hit people at a certain moment like it does for me with skyrim like holy shit i'm here alone and then and whatever cruel nature that's out there doesn't really care about me exactly that's the that's that's the experience so you you wanna create the whole planet and you wanna have many of them we have we do have many but once you build that system i think the numbers become i mean honestly a little bit we we wrap it in so we can name them all and and have a finite set even though it's a very very large number but a set that we can you know validate and and know about even though it's a huge number but once you once you're building a system that can build a planet i mean a planet is sort of infinite space we go back to the daggerfall analogy right if you have systems to build that much space doing a hundred planets or a thousand or ten thousand or a million planets is not it's just you just press you just change the number and press the button but you can't you can't name them all you can't control like when you're getting in really big numbers hey what is what does this system way out here feel like if you take your ship and jump that far we do level the systems when you go to system you'll see oh this is like a level forty system and us being able to at least control that scale is how we kinda ended up with the hundred ish systems we have what what are the what are the levelings what what do you mean by level level you see like when you look at a map in a game it says this is the area for low level players this is level one oh got it got it yeah yeah so we do that on a system basis star system i read that space travel is considered dangerous in this game can you explain that's more of that goes back to a tone thing right when you actually play the game because it's a game like we don't really kill you when you fly out in space but it has a tone of there's some effort involved and we've dialed it back as we've been making the game whereas we used to run out of fuel you jump and get stranded which on paper was a great like it's a great moment when you get stranded and you have to press this beacon you don't know who's gonna come turns out that's not like it just stops your game we found you'll be playing the game and i ran out of fuel okay i guess i'll just wander these planets trying to mine for fuel so i can get back to what i was doing mhmm it just you know it's a fun killer that's too realistic of a simulation of the human condition yeah i know the idea was well it's for you know games do that if you had like a hardcore you're right a hardcore survival mode that's the kind of thing you would do maybe we'll do it in the future but it's more of like a tone how they build their ships do they have all the right things for safety we do get into environmental things on the planets you know and your space suit obviously a lot of different space suits and buffs for you know the gases the toxicity or the temperature on on various planets are there robots yes those companions are they robots by chance can you can you one of the companions the robot vasco yeah okay so they have they have they have a name and a personality and so on and vasco does and then there's a whole bunch of i call them generic robots they're you like we use them for utility you know okay people we actually dial them back because if you think about well you know a lot about this more than me in terms of i'm offended right now you're calling robots generic and you no no no the ones we use the ones we we use we made them more generic we didn't we didn't actually sensitive about this stuff i understand very if you were to chart the future you would say robots would have a much bigger role in our future than we are presenting but that was a tone thing so we most of our robots are there as utility robots and there are some combat ones as well as enemies so it's a deeply human world very much yes in in terms of tone so have you talked to elon about this about this game is there a little bit how much of reality like the work of spacex is it an an inspiration for the decisions made in this game i wouldn't say it's for the decisions we made but you know visiting spacex and walking in there it was it's like the avengers meet nasa it's like the most amazing and here we're building the next gen like see the the dragon stuff before it was you know other people saw it like just i was really in awe you know just giant machine that looks for imperfections on the surface of these giant you know fuchsia i just you know whenever yeah and because you know we're in dc go to the air and space museum a lot and so whenever i look at those kind of things or you know you'll visit the space shuttle sort of overcome with how big it is and i go stand back by the engines and think about that thing leaving orbit you know and one of the things that elon really impresses like we're reaching the edge of physics on a lot of stuff where how hard it is to leave orbit the gravitational pull and like so the engineering that has gone into that our space program what what he's doing now i just marvel at i don't understand right i'm not at that level but i marvel at the kind of human ingenuity and scale i was on the delaware coast last month and i went i was outside i was outside for some reason it was dark and i saw this crazy light in the sky and i thought it was like a helicopter and then it didn't go away and i'm like if someone what is that i had called my we had so some friends hey does everybody see this what is that and we just stood dumbfounded looking at this thing in the sky and like that is a ufo nobody takes their phone out everyone i'm with like four people everyone is too dumbstruck you would think why don't you take a picture of this thing and the next day we found out it was in in the news it was the spacex launch in florida and i'm seeing it from delaware maryland area it was one of the most it was incredible it's just even just that i am in complete awe of is there some aspect of that that you can replicate the the majestic nature of that in in a video game i wish i had the answer to that you know i think some of it we were doing when you're standing on a planet and you see you see the other moons go by yeah and then you realize i could get my ship blast off and land there and build myself a home i think that's pretty cool there's a minor thing we do which is we we have other ships come and go from the starports when you're there so you'll be in a city and then you hear this when you hear the engine you look up and a ship is taken off or coming like that's great there's nothing for you to do but it's i think it's awesome yeah yeah so then that's all about creating the soundscape to feel seeing it and like oh that's real that's a ship that or you jump into a system and you see these freighters and sometimes they contact you like it's not all just like jump in and combat do you ever think about the fact that science fiction seems to make it has a way of creating reality not just kind of predicting it or imagining it it's almost like the thing you put out there with a video game like this like starfield that you anticipate it it kind of fuels people's imagination what is possible maybe i don't know i don't know i can't i can't say you're making me think now about other science fiction that movie i love minority report it's more of like a not a space movie but more like looking at the future mhmm if you look at a lot of the things in that movie it's almost like i think those are coming true yeah i mean is that is that the one that's you do interface this like it's the interfaces and then the you know the way he looks at his child is more like a holographic almost ar vr kind of thing or digital billboards or trying to predict human behavior there's a that there's just a lot of future stuff in that movie as it comes to sci fi to your other question i don't know i i i don't know well i i think it does and it's interesting i mean i suppose you're trying to create the most realistic sticking to the tone the most immersive realistic world and almost by accident you create the thing that is possible because you want it to be realistic in some deep sense so accidentally it can become the possible and then that places that idea in people's heads i mean if if humans are ever to become a multiplanetary species we need we need to play games we need to read sci fi to help imagine that that's possible to look outside of earth to look outside look up on the stars then we can actually travel out there i don't know there's power to sci fi to do that mhmm i guess you you shouldn't feel the pressure of that i don't know if i'd make the leap now that's all that what we're doing might no maybe you know one of our hopefully it might inspire some young people who are headed in that direction they're like oh i thought about getting into space and space exploration and being an engineer or doing these things and i played this game and you know it really sparked that interest in me so i'm gonna go take that as a field and maybe that's the person who goes and does some of these things yeah because in the next couple of decades likely a human being will step foot on mars which are the first steps towards us becoming multi planetary and then if you read some of the stuff they're doing with the james webb telescope and them being able to look for signs of life on other planets is quite fascinating and you know recent stuff i read say they think in twenty years they will so it's actually quite encouraging to think i i it's almost a dream of mine like in our lifetimes that we discover life on another planet yeah especially if it's intelligent life i've been talking to a lot of biologists and a lot of folks i imagine there's life everywhere out there the the numbers are would say so yes the challenging question is what it looks like and how much of it is intelligent so a lot of biologists tell me the big the big difficult leap is from the precarious to the eukaryotes so like the the complex life it could be that a lot of our universe is just filled with bacteria my belief if if i'm understanding it right that there's two ways they're gonna look at planets when they can look at you know they can read hey the this planet has this kind of gas mhmm they can now look at the ones that are created by potential life forms and then the ones that are created the byproducts of industry mhmm there's only certain ones that are created if you have a society there and that they can start looking on these types of in these types of star systems and these planets but it takes a lot of time because you have to book time in that telescope you have to like look at that planet over a long period of time but in theory given enough time given the amount of space out there we would find one that would be a cool thing in this short life of ours to find out definitively that there is an an an industrial intelligence civilization out there before you could contact them so like die end your life not knowing the rest of the story but just know that it's out there that's a cool and then if you have kids be like well this one's on you f this i'm out and i'm fascinated by what it would do to the way i think in a positive way the way humanity thinks about itself here like no there's there is a definitively other life out there i mean both things if there isn't life out there that's also a huge responsibility both are super exciting if we're alone it's super exciting because there's a responsibility to preserve whatever special thing we have going on here this whether you call it the flame of consciousness or whether it's consciousness or intelligence that's a special thing preserve it have it expand but if there's others out there i mean that like that sparks that drive for exploration of reaching out to the stars and meeting them most of them probably wanna kill us so but luckily we have the military industrial complex on earth that builds bigger and better weapons all the time space force space force right it will both protect us and destroy all our enemies this this is one hundred percent a video game we're living in okay back back to dragons so blink once if you know when elder scrolls six is coming out but are not going to tell me okay i have a vague idea okay vague idea in in so like if you have the quantum mechanical interpretation that allows for multiple universes in the universe where you didn't blink what would that todd tell me about the year it's coming out would it be twenty twenty five trick question or twenty six i've been asked that question yeah many ways but never like that yeah i thought i would try to sneak it out with you and i mean there is there is of course no answer because i wish it was soon you know i like we don't we want them out too you know and i wish they didn't take as long as they did but they do and look i mean if i could go back in time would never have been my plan to wait as long as it's it's taken for it so you love that world the eldest girls' world look it's it's part of who i am spent more time there than anything else in my life probably right so i it's deeply love it we we all do it's a part of us and you know when you aren't doing it for a while you you really do miss it and when i look at what we're doing have planned for that game and i was in a meeting yesterday i was like i just wanna play all this right now but it you know we're gonna make sure we do it right for everybody and we do have to approach it people are playing games for a long time you know skyrim's eleven years old still probably our most played game and so we don't see it slowing down and people will probably be playing it ten years from now also so you have to think about okay people are gonna play the next elder scrolls game for decade two decades and that does change the way you think about how you architect it from from the get go what what are some elements that changed the way like how do you make a game that's playable for twenty years so i i know we're trying to figure that out but there but there is some elements i should pause on that you know pardon me i'm of course asking jokingly i'm excited for it but i think skyrim is an amazing game still you know i really enjoy it still yeah and you know what the content the even if think if you step away from it for a while then play what i'll put say the vanilla version without mods if you go and haven't played in a while there's always a new way to play it but then if you look at the mods and what creators are doing to it we think that is just awesome mhmm it's something that we've always supported we're gonna keep supporting we've hired a large number of modders that are now professionals we wanna support the people who are doing on their own so they can be professionals on their own and how do you create a world that's moddable so you you think of designing the game from the start as that that enables mods yep absolutely so it starts with us like everything we're doing okay a modder a content creator is gonna have to do it use our tools now we do clean them up for release you know you because if you're like a developer in house you can deal with some kludginess mhmm when you're putting stuff together when you put it out for people we do clean a lot of it up and there's still a lot obviously a learning curve there but we have look we have people who've been doing it for twenty years with us what's involved with modding i'm actually quite newbish at this okay and i'm almost afraid to ask because now that you explained to me i'll i i fear i will spend a very large amount of time creating mods well we have an editor you can download on steam the creation kit for our games and then it loads up the world and you could do something really really small like change the color of the weather and it creates a little plug in file we call it you know a modification to the game and then you can run your game with that it's on console now the the mods not the editing and it's just been incredible our community there has been amazing what they do with the games so a lot of it is the the the visuals a lot of people do visual things because it's the easiest thing to do first or they'll build a new space there's some great things with like i love the khajiit follower mod for skyrim it's awesome the there have been quest lines those things just take a really really long time and so someone is gonna do that that's almost like it takes them a long time it's more than a hobby and we're always looking at ways that we can make it like hey they can turn a career into it mhmm because it's just awesome what about is is there any possibility in doing a mod for the some of the ai stuff there is and i've seen some but to really move it along if they're using the tools that we already put out there so to really move the ai along you'd have to get in the code mhmm which some people have figured out ways to hack in and do things with script extenders but for the most part like that's right really pushing it it does take us which is why you see when we have a new game come along the palette that they have is there's there's so many more things they can do well i've i've built bots that play the the driving games but they do that by just taking reading the screen and doing basic not basic it's actually pretty complicated but computer vision doing the control we're basically assimilating the human player to do that for skyrim or for one some of the open world games that's literally you have to create agi to be able to yep to play the those open well maybe not maybe you can create a super dumb like just a two handed sword and just keep swinging until it's pretty set there's some bot stuff out there that does it we have we have some very very dumb bots that we use to run through the world to test it that we'll deploy on a whole bunch of servers just to you know we do it every day we run through every space we're doing starfield and it's just running they're all out there well it it it does it very quickly it loads up every place every every place in the game and runs around a little bit and then loads the next place and runs around a little bit we're just testing like did a crash what's the memory growth what's the get a report here are all the places where the frame rate wasn't up to snuff and then we do have one that will play on its own it's heavily scripted but it lets us test you know every time we make a build there's a bot that runs through like the first one or two main quests like it'll just play it that way we know do we break anything because you don't wanna waste like qa's time like you guys broke it again within five minutes so yeah yeah so that's for that's for like broken stuff right i wonder if you can build a bot that estimates the quality of the experience oh my gosh okay can you do that not yet but just like the number like how boring or not boring the boring meter how many times you die how many times you die death is death boring or exciting that's the question i mean i i don't i i feel like there's a balance to be struck there because you always want to be in fear of death against yeah we always we have this chart at work we use which is like if you think about any game that you've played that you've put down it's either about a frustration slash confusion or boredom yeah you gotta put the player right in the middle of that but i've sometimes put down games from frustration only to return again stronger dark souls yeah yeah so i mean that that that's i mean the challenge that's part of it it's well i don't know actually skyrim i don't i'm one of those i mean i'm sure there's all kinds of humans that you've interacted with about what they enjoy but to me i could enjoy skyrim on every on any difficulty at the level it doesn't all of it so it depends the open world nature of it is what's really compelling mhmm not necessarily the challenge of the particular quest and so on but i'm not sure if that's the same experience for everybody do you play the survival mode there's a survival mode in skyrim it was a creation club thing it does like some hunger it does hot and cold it does some other systems that make it you know in our minds a little more believable it was actually a a creation club thing made by an external creator who is now full time with us so can we actually thinking about starfield thinking about elder scrolls six go through the full life of a video game you've created so what's it take to take a game from the idea to find the final product what are the different steps along the way great question well usually it starts with i mean honestly lunchtime conversations with a number of us hey we we think we wanna do this this is what it's gonna be like i mean look with an elder scrolls you know you're gonna do it it's a matter of when so okay what's the tone we're going for right where's it set so we usually start with the world and then we're always overlapping so while we're making one game as we're you know getting in the throes of it or wrapping it you know probably in the by the midpoint of one game we've had enough conversations to understand what the next one's gonna be what are the big ticket like where's it set what's the tone is there a big ticket feature too that make it really unique and then when we're finishing one game we start prototyping sorry before that we start concepting so we'll do concept art and for one reason or another i usually have the beginning of the game worked out like i like to think about okay how's the game start what's the player do first we do music early you know so take elder scrolls six we forgot where it's set what's the tone what are the big features we discussed the beginning of the game which we've had for a very long time where's it set again just kidding yep in tamriel and damn it well at least we know we narrowed it down that yeah that'll be epic if it was like a portal into another dimension anyway then i like to do music so we've already done a take on the music for elder scrolls six so you can sit there with the with like the the concept art and the music you can feel it no no the music i like we put in the teaser for it this was two thousand eighteen we've taken that further obviously and again we're working on the world you're then doing concepting and design for the world and then once we we're wrapping up one game we can really start prototyping the new one and you're usually building kind of your initial spaces and so we do like to do like a first playable a smaller section of the game that we can sort of prove out and show to people hey this is how it feels different this is what it looks like this is what's unique about it then we turn that into a larger chunk when more of the team comes on when the other game is done and that's still what we call a v s vertical slice so you still don't have the full team on it and it's a larger chunk of the game that you can play and then once you feel good about that you're gonna bring on the rest of the team and we're fortunate that the other games we've done are popular enough that we can be doing dlc and content and those kind of things while we're getting the one going and then we're at full production where we're sort of at maximum size we just call that production that's like the full production period and that depending on the game you know can run a year or two years maybe more and then you kinda have a finalizing final six months to a year on a game which is okay we've built everything now and usually it needs a lot of glue where we have a lot of very different elements that maybe aren't clicking together the way you want outside of the regular polish for levels and features and we're shaving and gluing and sticking things together so that it's not the schizophrenic game experience that things flow from one into another in terms of story like in on that level of course no usually the story the designers have done a really good job it's more about game features you know and then how they interact with the story or hey i went from this experience to this experience or picking flowers and alchemy feels like a different game then and then how is another character referencing that and how is that intersecting with the skill system and the interface like the skill system and the interface is the party host if you think about a game most games particularly what what i like to do is that's your person who says welcome do this go here check this out and the skill system and the way it reacts on the hud the interface of the game is sort of leading you to the next thing mhmm and and once you get that flow down and the the the rate at which the game is giving you activities then you're in like what we we describe as a game flow what is and it it's not till really that last year before that the game flow was just it's not it doesn't even exist mhmm in the way that you see it in the final game and that's what we were working on a lot that last year so at which point is like the set of skills a skill tree the characteristics of the role playing aspect of it when is that set the ideas we usually have it in the beginning but it's just we know it won't be done until that last year we'll have one but we know it's gonna get honed because it's not until you really see okay how impactful is that one how much are you doing it like how much are you really and the main combat ones they always win you always know the players will drift toward the combat type skills because every character needs some amount of that but okay well how how important is cooking how important is alchemy how important is these other type of activities and then how do you balance them where when you load up the skill menu it isn't automatically give me plus ten damage mhmm how do you get the what about the combat system that does seem to be an important part of a lot of games you start in the beginning yeah every time yep so usually when we're making that first playable it's an area you can go through some amount of dialogue some amount of combat how do you get the combat right what what's the secret to a great combat system well first on a control side helping the player when they don't realize it there's a lot of tricks you can do with magnetism in terms of the controller and where the attacks go so it has to feel the minute to minute has to feel really good in your hands there's a lot of animation time right and changing animation so they're impactful and they they happen at a rate that the player feels like they're really doing it mhmm and then ultimately it's the illusion that the enemies are smart but they really are there for you to kill them right so they do a lot of things to just let themselves get killed they're not near as smart near as smart as we can make them because it turns out that is not fun right so there's a balance between but there's a that is i guess a a kind of ai and it's a very intimate interaction with an ai because it's like there's a lot of stuff going on it's not just very kinda shallow like a dialogue or something like that it's like there's a time critical nature of it a lot of stuff is happening and if ever if anything feels off it's it's gonna feel wrong yep all the games do it you know it's not unique to what we do in terms of how they handle combat scenarios and there's some games that just do it extremely well in terms of even in multiplayer where you're playing bots and most people don't know it or how a a multiple enemy scenario is really you you know they don't all shoot you they trade off they're gonna wait and i was like alright i'll just wait my turn because we don't wanna overwhelm him but he feels like you feel like you're overwhelmed when there's six enemies but you know a good game will no they're gonna they're gonna take their time is there a science to it is it is it art is it like like how how do how do yes i mean it's it's it's all of that so it's like an iterative process where you try different things you have different ideas there's a lot of there's a lot of animation it's a lot of timing animation work hud work also how does the reticule change what are the little sound effects what about like the the gamified like that is fun that again that goes back to the winning you know so winning is fun yes death is not yes let the wookie win i like how you have to dumb down the ai to make it fun for humans because if if you didn't it would just be just slaughter nonstop for for all humans that's good to know what about things like you said cooking like crafting making potions and poisons and smithing weapons and armor cooking mhmm how do you get that right what's what's interesting there it's such an interesting like just you know a lot of games don't have that kind of thing so what role does that play in a you know i think we in the game's great cracked it in a way i liked with fallout four actually where when we're doing elder scrolls we have like the flowers and things and you have alchemy and we took this to okay if it's post apocalyptic what if everything in the world was an chemical ingredient in some kind so breaking it down to their components so when you walk around a world like that again we like the simulation we like we like the forks and the spoons and the cups and all that okay how can i use those to create so i i love how it works starts working in fallout four where okay all these things i find there is they have some value in creating or crafting outside of a cup is worth one gold piece or one cap by the way i have to be honest i haven't played fallout four i played fallout three i thought that was a legendary game i've been can you make a case for fallout four that i should or should i just wait till fallout five and when does that come out you should play fallout four love to hear your thoughts alright it's a different game it's skyrim dude i mean it's we've we've tried to make them all different they all they all have they are fundamentally different they all have their own tone yeah so fallout three and fallout four intentionally a very different tone oh really interesting yeah so what what what's that world like what's the post apocalyptic world of fallout if you can just briefly take a stroll into that world tone wise well there's look in entertainment there's a lot of post apocalyptic stuff and what what makes fallout tick is the the world that was left behind the world that blew itself up this utopian world of nuclear energy and it all goes wrong so i love the american dream of that like how they vision the future in the fifties and that blowing itself up i think that's like a super interesting place to explore which is why we always wanted to play in that world and it does an amazing job of sort of weaving you know the drama and darkness of a post apocalyptic world with b movie humor you know it winks at the camera sometimes often actually and that when when you're in that world it just has this this its own unique flow and and vibe outside of anything else kind of in that genre so the elder scrolls has or at least skyrim has some humor has a little bit but fall leans into it a little more a little bit more a little bit more yeah yeah it does it's like ironic humor it's the duck and cover so get under your desk if the bomb comes and everything will be fine it's that type of humor so the funny thing is i do think fallout three is one of the the greatest games ever you said that quote when we started fallout three in two thousand four we obviously had big ideas of what we could do with it and i talked to a lot of people from ex developers to press folks to fans what made it special what are the key things you'd want out in in a new one the opinions and i'll put this mildly varied a lot but they would all end the same like a stern father pausing for effect but do not screw it up how do you not screw up a game you have not screwed up many games yet i mean back to the fallout one yeah yeah that was look that i remember that we were met with a lot of skepticism in terms of oh what are they gonna do with this it was a beloved kinda isometric turn based role playing game you know awesome for when it came out and actually it was announced we had finished morrowind but not announced oblivion but because we'd acquired the rights we had to announce it because i think interplay was a public company i don't remember i just remember we had to announce it and we're thinking there well you're gonna we're gonna piss off all the elder scrolls fans because we're announcing a fallout game we're probably gonna piss off the hardcore fallout fans because we didn't make the original and clearly we'll probably make a different kind of game so i do remember you know there was a lot of concern with with all of our fans and fans of fallout at the time and so i think it was pretty rewarding for us that that game found the audience and success that it that it did is one of my favorite projects that i've ever ever worked on and because it was so fresh for us and we we had a very clear like even before we had the rights like this is the game we're gonna make like we're this is the kind of thing we're gonna do and we had done more when then we were working on oblivion and it was kind of a breath of fresh air to do it and what's kind of remarkable is fallout three comes out just you know two and a half years after oblivion and we did all this dlc for oblivion so we were really really kind of prolific in how our development how it was going so i just remember enjoying making that game so much because it was everything we were doing was new which which after the world creation was there some innovation like technically that was happening there creation like it was you know obviously a different look even though some of us very few of us had worked on the terminator things the vat system the skill system and we love the original game so much so you felt this responsibility to bring it back in a big way and reintroduce it in a way that you know as much as we could scratch the same itch when you when you played the original game that had the same tone are there some favorite things to you about that world that just kinda connect you to the fallout three i love again i usually start with the beginning i love the beginning i love the character generation if you go if you played it a lot or you're developing it it starts to feel really long mhmm but the first time you play it or second i just think it's awesome and this idea it's a hard thing to say okay we want we want you to feel like your character on the screen even when you play like a skyrim you don't know what you were doing before that but fallout three you you were born in the vault and you raised in the vault and you lived in the vault but you experienced a part of that so it's a very different when you step out it i think it really i mean the visuals are the visuals but the emotional moment of stepping out of the vault you feel like you lived your whole life in the vault that and you feel like you have a sense of your past right and i need to find my father we we should isn't it possible to have that sense with like elder scrolls like a life story like like childhood trauma and stuff back to the human i mean you'd have to like i'll we look you do some of that stuff but they go through menus you you know pick your background we're doing that in starfield hey pick your background what were you doing before this moment can you pick your traumas and stuff like make a mod for a mod mod you wanna make a mod yeah thank you go go for that and then also make a mod for like a therapist but a lot of it you know is in your head you're gonna you're gonna do that you're gonna pick this background you do these things and you're sort of like this is who i was yeah and we intentionally with elder scrolls kinda make it as much of a blank slate you know elder scrolls is a little bit more of a blank slate game to who you are which has a a lot of positives and and fallout for us has been more of a this is this this was your life before here's who you were go be who you wanna be but this is the background it's a little more strict now this might reveal something about me and speaking of childhood trauma but i but i but i feel like there's a lot of a lot of the meaningful experience of a role playing game is not just the development of the character throughout the game but the initial character creation like you said is there something to that process that you found to be powerful like the design of that process because you think so much about that beginning what how much should be controlled how much should be defined the interface itself the visual appearance of the character too mhmm because i feel like that you're loading in you start to load in the world that you're about to enter by creating that character right yeah we think about it a lot it's a really really good comment and question and it's more than it has to set the whole stage it has to like pique your interest for the world you're gonna enter and we've done it so many different ways in terms of when you actually go to make your character when you're making the choice and one of the things over time that we've wanted to avoid is people starting over so there's a lot of intentionality around the types of choices you have that can be undone or not undone because what you what game players want to is i'll play it and then i'll i'll make a new character but sometimes they do that because they realize they made the wrong type of character and as a designer you don't want that to happen so some people and we get this comment in elder scrolls like oh you simplified it no no no no we move those choices into the gameplay so that you don't you know make this character in the beginning and then eight hours later realize you make a horrible mistake and so okay i'm gonna start out like that to me is a really really bad experience so also like life itself but yes go ahead but like life is okay so you can then fix it in game right i wish i wish i had learned archery well i'm gonna start tomorrow yeah so you can do that like the skyrim character system you know is really designed around that all you pick is like what's your race and that gives you some things but there's nothing you can't get then on your own mostly it sounds weird but you mostly want that beginning character generation to be visual which you then can also change in the game and some starting skills that get you off to the type of play that you want but if you discover you don't like that type of play mhmm as you play you can move your character along so we have moved away post you know oblivion to a classless meaning you don't have a strict character class warrior mage thief whatever in our games and that's that's continuing for the do you do are you like thinking of elder scrolls six you're already thinking about that kind of stuff so you think of early on the the the like you said the first few experiences in the game you're already thinking through them yep yeah we we know what the first few hours are like we we know what the character system is basically like and so totally what's the difference to you between oblivion skyrim morrowind oblivion skyrim and elder scrolls six like i i good to me i've i mean stuff blends together yeah but oblivion that's when you could make spells and stuff you could you could do it in morrowind as well oblivion has some more guardrails on it morrowind's where you can really go and daggerfall and i don't remember if you make spells in arena i think you can someone will correct me you definitely can in daggerfall it gets crazy morrowind you can somewhat and then we start we start putting guardrails on it because people started breaking the game in certain ways yeah why is it about to break the game like you always want it to be well there's like one people love in morrowind where you could make these recall stones and you could teleport mhmm to different areas which you really need in that game it breaks so many quests yeah and so as we any any quest we were then we would do this this exercise of designing a quest and then someone would say and then i recall away oh okay the quest is broken and then one day someone says can we just get rid of that spell effect everyone's like yes please and so it allowed us to make better content so the tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent how do you create a a compelling quest because there's all kinds of personalities of humans that play these games right because i like the grind well there's look there's there's multiple flavors of a compelling quest mhmm you know some of them have very good upfront storytelling you just like the story and the npc that's giving you this task and you'll go through a more handcrafted experience that the designers have done a really really good job on the space it has some some twist or surprise in the middle and then the ending has some you know multiple options that the player feels like they had they got to do something they made an interesting choice but the best ones for me are actually were all of that was far more open ended the how i am going to accomplish this task is completely up to me and i'm gonna find some ingenious solution a silly the but this will like this just sounds very basic it's gonna sound quite cliche and silly it was like go find me five daedric hearts or whatever like find me x of something that's hard to get it's a very simple set you can give a simple story setup for that and we're not telling the player where to get those and they think now where could i get those mhmm and i actually find those to be just as rewarding as the really handcrafted well done little bit more linear with an interesting choice at the end if those objects are in the world in some you know believable way that there's usually some challenge at getting getting them how do you place objects in a world in an interesting way because it's a big part are those we have a level design you cannot people if they only knew how much we spend on we have a clutter group a group of people who clutter like we like what's what's clutter mean is all the stuff around just like interior decorators yeah for treasure and stuff and trash and they go through every space and they clutter it our level designers think about it a lot these also become landmarks for the player when you're walking through a space and oh this is the place with this and there is a logic to making a good level as they say with even if you walk by like a little t intersection that becomes like a decision point in the player's head like oh i didn't go down that way but the more you do that it looks easy on paper but when you're playing a game you actually kinda wanna limit those because he's trying to keep track of all his decision points then they get lost then yes we have maps but anytime the player's going to check a map in a place like that i feel that it's more of like a backstop mhmm for certain players but if we if they need to check the map i feel like we've kind of failed got it so it's just there there's a there's a momentum to it it just pulls pulls them in it just goes through everything a lot of games you played a lot of levels where you're just like i'm a little confused or i don't know and you play other levels where like man i just i yeah i it was great i went through it it was well balanced i knew where i was going and it's not you don't wanna ever be mazy as long as you know where you're going as long as you know you made those choices then it feels fine but as far as the treasure and all of the loot it is really an art we will not do enough clutter and then we will over clutter mhmm and then there's too much stuff everywhere and then we declutter every single game game i wish we got better at it it would save us a lot of time but you're constantly going by feel like this is not this is too much it's not enough right right because the other thing is look it creates people wanna pick everything up they wanna click everything so if you have too many things of importance in a room it's like it it actually makes you feel a little tight as a player you're like well i need i'm basically an idiot if i don't pick all this stuff up yeah you probably felt this way yeah yeah yeah for sure and like the moment where you decide that you're just like i've clicked so many things in this room i actually am gonna leave that ammo canister there yeah but you feel like a dope yeah you've probably experienced it yes but but also you have a you have a joy from if if there's not many items and you found the one and you got it right and you feel good i got it and then it's finding like oh i stuck my head in this corner and you know i picked this lock and i opened this locker and there was this there was this thing i've been waiting for yeah what about like rare and rare items that's an art even more so of an art i will say we have a ways to go there in terms of finding the right drop rate for special items we call them your epic rare legendary you look at games like so many games do it and there are ones that p you just play and love because they have it down you know destiny destiny two is great at it diablo a series i love you know sort of famously diablo three which i think is great and they did an update it mostly just changed the loot drops and it's like this whole new experience and there's a really real art to it i think that that we're still learning we're still learning a lot and have to we're trying to you know get better at it because it's one of those things where it drives you through the game it's it's fun to get the treasure in diablo and skyrim have this interesting quality of being extremely popular and there's a lore around like rare items so it's a it changes the dynamic of like you could afford to have really rare items yes and then and then somebody finds it and that becomes like a thing i mean as you release a game there's a there's a i mean a lot of people play and they start sharing stories and so on it's so interesting because that's part of the game experience is the stories of others right for us a hundred percent because we've been classically with most of our stuff single player mhmm that that water cooler shared experience we would have a thing like where we call them did you know moments like we gotta have a bunch so you meet someone they do what are you doing and then they say did you know if you go here and do this what did you know and that to us is aware of a lot of our community has has been sharing their stories and here's what you can do has there ever been a temptation to create not a single player game that's gigantic that's well we did fall in seventy six we have elder scrolls online not not a game i created but and and look that started as more classic mmo know the folks they're part of our company who made that game and it's insanely insanely popular it is okay so i should try it out they do some great storytelling quests like the actual mechanics aren't the same as skyrim but the world is awesome they've just done an incredible job you know it's about to be ten years for that game as well and they this is you know great community around that yeah it's i haven't played because there's a there's a mobile fallout game right i need to play that i i was thinking of playing diablo mobile too i mean you can debate the monetization but i would not it's i think they did a it's really fun on fallout what's what's the on diablo oh diablo on the well fallout i definitely recommend that one fallout shelter completely different game yeah diablo immortal is i was very very impressed i had a lot of fun on the mobile yeah what's the challenge of designing a game for mobile versus the pc and console well obviously the screen size right is that what you feel first what what what's the what's the fundamental change in the in the philosophy of design does it does it constrain does it change the tone of the game well we've done a few things and we have a new mobile game that we're working on that we haven't announced yet that i'm in love with there are a couple things that you approach on mobile now i can give you sort of the classic mobile gaming thing and then what we do mhmm you know a classic mobile gaming is really for short play sessions because for the amount of people you're gonna get the the number that have the amount of time to sit there for a long time and play it like a console game or a pc game is is lower because people are playing mobile games on the move or whatever and how it onboards you because obviously most of them are free so the tutorial how the tutorial works how it gets you into the game because you haven't bought it you haven't done this investment of buying it and then saying no i'm gonna learn it people don't care so really understanding how they get into the game those two things are really the magic to mobile gaming we have found though with our games you know particularly fallout shelter people will sit there for an hour or two like they will just sit there and play it like large numbers of people will play it for hours a day so it's there is a more i don't know addicting element to the mobile because i guess you can spend more time with it you know if you look at kids these days they can stare at their phone for hours that's all they do that's where they watch everything so it's also like a demographic thing the younger audience they would rather sit and stare at their phone than play it on a big screen i would just love to sort of list out throughout human history the evolution of sentences that began with if you look at kids these days it's true it's true the kids the kids of the kids these days will probably be talking about be doing like virtual reality like i love mobile games though i i play a ton of them i am like the game my favorite game this year is marvel snap this card game from the folks who did hearthstone you should really play it if you like do you like card games yeah yeah do you like superheroes no it's genius you don't like superheroes no i don't like superheroes i never understood listen this never this is girl like superhero grow growing up in the soviet union what i don't understand the this is alright well i don't understand you're wearing a costume it's it's it's silly to me i can't so you have to suspend like you you have to be able to immerse yourself and for some reason there's something about costumes costume it doesn't get me but then again i'm like into elves and dragons so i don't understand and i'm fine i get it yeah but the rest the rest at least the america the western world disagrees with me so even batman you have like little ears but that's fine well back to elder scrolls starfield so one thing i didn't ask you about when you look at the timeline of five six seven eight years whatever it is to create a game what's the role of the deadline internally not publicly enough keeps you honest do you try to keep in your own brain a deadline for the team a deadline yeah all the time and when you set that deadline early in the development do you try to set deadline like that's really tough to reach no we try to make it like hey this is our best guess if you make it tough to reach it's sort of you know you're gonna miss it it's arbitrary we really try to you know keep ourselves honest because it it will let you know where you're at right when i first playable we wanna be done with prototyping or designed by this date we wanna have first playable this date we wanna have this but look you know things happen pandemic happens people go home it's throws everything off or you know what you needed to do because we're not just like making a game and then moving everybody on you know what you needed to do like skyrim was so popular we kept people on that game for longer so it delayed a little bit we were doing with fallout four at the time because we can't we're you know hey we really shouldn't move the people on fallout yet because we're doing these things in skyrim and we should so it just sort of keeps you honest for where you're where you're at does it get super stressful as you get closer are you are you trying to avoid announcing anything is there a temptation to announce well i've done it all ways right i've i've announced you know starfield we're pretty you know loud with a a release date that we then had a delay so was that tough it was it was but it was the right thing to do and how how do you know it's the right thing like when you when you sat down and looked at it like this is not ready it's not an exact science but you can look at what needs to be done and the amount of time you have and you know we've done it in the past where we can get it done we're we we believe we can and so you're fighting that personal belief that you can get something done but there's a lot of things that go into release date with marketing and publishing and you know we've reached a point where on starfield where it was it was pretty clear to us even though you wanna say you can get it done that the risk involved with that to the to the fans to the game to the team to the company we're part of xbox now to everybody was we should really we should really move it and give it the time it needs so you mentioned part of xbox microsoft bought bethesda and and azimax for seven point five billion dollars what's it like joining the xbox team you've you've i think written about it what's what what are the what are the exciting aspects of that you know when your company goes through a change like that no matter what it is even if it's somebody that you've worked with for a long time you never know what you're in for you hope and i had worked with them for since we started doing console stuffs with morrowind was you know they came to us came to me and hey you should make this game for the xbox and so when they were making that console had a great experience with them and then on the three sixty with oblivion and so i guess the point is we felt that we had a very good relationship with everybody there and we understood what their culture was but you never really know and and i mean this honestly it's been awesome that the culture inside of microsoft and xbox that that people see from the outside is the culture inside the way they talk about players the the way they'll invest in the players the risks they'll take the thoughtfulness from phil spencer on down has been you know feel really really lucky and then a game like starfield where look we've had a lot of success with with the games that you talked about but we've never been kind of the platform seller you know the game for a platform for a period of time and so you know there is a lot of pressure there there's a lot of responsibility there to make sure we deliver for everybody is there a chance that starfield is exclusive to xbox it is it is exclusive it's officially already yep yes so you're i get it so extra pressure also creating a new world yeah it's new but keep in mind for us that exclusivity is not unique even though we've done playstation stuff and i think the playstation five is just an insane machine they've they've done a great job and we've had great success on playstation we were traditionally a pc developers in the beginning we transitioned to xbox became our lead platform like morrowind's basically exclusive to xbox oblivion was exclusive to xbox for a long period of time skyrim dlc was ex we so we've done a lot of like our initial stuff is all xbox so we get into development and saying we're focused on xbox and it's not abnormal for us in any way it's been kind of the norm and from a development side i you know i like the ability to focus so our ability to focus and say and have help from them you know the top engineers at xbox to say we are gonna make this look incredible on the new systems is like from from my standpoint it's just awesome what's the difference in creating the the console versus the pc i also have to admit i've never is this shameful actually you should recommend to me i've never played skyrim or any any of the games you've created on xbox really yeah and on console i i played i mean i have to play very little xbox sure i mean look there's there's the obvious interface part between mouse and keyboard and then a controller but when you're looking at hardware pcs it's tough right because you're looking at well you know what are their driver versions what kind of monitor do they have what is the actual refresh rate of x y and z we're used to it yeah but if you know anyone will tell you give me the hardware that i know i'm writing it for you know this mhmm and the the series x is just a incredible machine and now that they know what it is you know what it is what it is and and now that we're part of xbox getting you know the people who built it to show you how to make it really really dance is is just awesome is there a case to be made did you get people that enjoy people that do both pc and xbox that that enjoy xbox more like the if if they have a choice yeah that they they enjoy it i think that depends on and look now that you you can kind of cross you can take your save and go between and all those things you can yeah if you depends on if for which games so for which skyrim if you have the game pass pc version of it versus steam not not via steam right now not via steam got it and so there's the game pass so i'm i'm like learning about this so there's a microsoft game so this is gonna be on game pass and then you can if yeah if you can take it from pc through game pass but i think it depends on like like for me like what's my physical mood do i wanna lean back on a sofa exactly right like my the actual physicality of it is what determines where i wanna play yeah do i wanna be two feet from a thing right now and sometimes i like that i am more of a console player just because i sit on my pc at work all day like i play a lot of video games so when i get home and i'm gonna play something else like i am a sofa screen controller person let me ask you a ridiculous question so you've created some of the greatest games ever i i think there's there's the question will be what's the best game of all time alright alright just give me a second so tetris alright yeah that's interesting have you read the book on tetris no you should read it particularly someone who grew up in russia yep it's a i'm sure there's an interesting story the fact that there's a book about tetris is fascinating is is there a book about mario i would love i i would love to find out more but i think i would put personally i would put skyrim i'll take that good answer at number one for me which is tough however you put it because you could also make the case out of the elder scrolls series like what do you actually value more if you put tetris and super mario up there then like the credit goes to morrowind maybe over skyrim i don't i don't know where the biggest leaps are but overall i think it's skyrim well for you if you're not allowed to pick any of the games you were involved with what are some interesting candidates for you that are just games that inspired the world impacted the world shook the world in terms of what video games are able to do well first i'm just sort of like hearing you say that you think skyrim is the best game of all time is quite like thank you mhmm and it's you know incredible thing to hear and you know when i think about we have a couple of answers there's ones that are like personal to me ultima seven is probably fine about ultima like you you said that as an inspiration i've i've never crossed that world well which it was what kind of game is it it's a role playing game mhmm you know circa nineteen ninety two ninety three ninety four and ultima online first you know really visual online world in that way but for me that was a virtual fantasy world where i had you know you could break bread you could pick all this stuff up i mean anyone who's played ultimas and plays our stuff can see the kind of touchstones and callbacks to that or inspirations and the other thing that i loved about ultima was actually the peer they were all different right that they iterated and there weren't necessarily what i'll call a plus one sequel outside of ultima seven part two clearly a plus one sequel but they each had their own tone i love like the boxes you know it's something that we get into as well i love this idea that a game also is this tangible thing oh when you when you buy it when you you buy you know the cardboard boxes and the way they were designed and ultima seven is black and ultima eight is the fiery gate and the paintings on them and i just you know does that break your heart a little bit that that culture is a is a big gone a little bit a little bit and that's also why i like you know this goes to video gaming or any other digital things where digital ownership has great value to people so i like looking at my collections of games even digitally i wanna see nice you know in the same way you wanna see nice album art wanna see nice cover art for our games and we spend a lot of time in them so that you know take a look at elder scrolls and morrowind oblivion and skyrim we want those boxes to look good next to each other going back to the video games you know i always mentioned tetris because i think it's you know obviously i love virtual worlds and those kind of things but for the time and what an interactive like video game sort of the simplest form i sort of think you can put tetris in front of just about anybody and they'll enjoy it and it's got some moment of challenge and it's just so elegant it's like to me the like this very pure game that only works because it's a video game and i think mobile games figured out some of the magic of tetris the simple some of them have yeah yeah and but tetris did it a long long time ago right that you you can really create that immersive experience without but for me you know the ultima civilization yeah as far as you know a grand strategy game pac man i mentioned in terms of bringing games into the mainstream in a way that captured people that nothing before it had super mario donkey kong everything nintendo i probably the best game makers in the world still they know who they are they know what they wanna do always in awe of what they create i gotta ask about the the a game i haven't played but people put up there as one of the greats zelda breath of the wild have you gotten a chance to play it a lot of it yes yes it's it's fantastic it's fantastic what do you think about i mean it's a very different experience i've played other zeldas than the open worlds you've created but it it is also an open world it is it's my favorite zelda because obviously like open world stuff and the the one thing that they do really really well is they don't constrain you some people you know even some of the things we do constrain you a little bit more zelda says here's the whole thing and you are constrained by the actual player abilities you haven't earned yet not some arbitrary barriers and so i think they just did a phenomenal job it's a magical game it really feels open it's because it it truly is yes what about i mean is there i'm i'm just like asking about some open world a very different one is the world of either grand theft auto or red dead redemption both love i would put gta three grand theft auto three up there with the landmark kind of usher in the open world when that comes out on the playstation two even though there was gta one and two this was an all new thing with the mobster storytelling the vice three d version i guess it it was then vice city is kind of a fast follow which could be my favorite one so you like i loved all the grand theft auto i think they're really phenomenally well made games same with red dead i think red dead redemption one could be my favorite story like highly recommend finishing that game so you like both the story you you like the grittiness of the because they have they have a bit of the like i guess if you like the fall fallout there's the humor the i don't know i don't know what it is it's the light hearted humor of it but also the brutality of human nature is in there too but it's like and also some of the fun they create with the music when you drive and stuff like that they they they create they create a world there's a tone they do there's a very strong tone very strong tone you know the satire on the world is just so well done the satire's good the gameplay is great i think they've just done a a phenomenal job is there any others that pop to mind portal portal yeah that's that's another weird creation i could just sit here and list games forever for a while i'm enjoying this hearthstone's a game i love i love all time like sports college football ncaa football was my favorite it's like i would say this is a great role playing oh you would actually keep getting role playing it's a role playing game because i have all these characters i have like you know sixty characters and they're all leveling up and then i have to play them and then the college one because i like college football they'd graduate so you lose your players and then they stop making the series and i know the folks at ea and they will say i have bugged them when is this and they're doing it so it's finally coming back nice what would you say is the is the is the greatest sports game of all time well it's ncaa football you have to pick the year and and see versus madden oh yeah yeah but there's more teams you get the college you know fight songs there's more pageantry and the players turn over they're only there for four seasons so you have to the the the so you know it's the there's it's more dynamic so you like variety versus so what was the last one two thousand fourteen maybe it was and you don't like fifa and i like look fifa's incredible i just look i'm a college football fan they they give you that fantasy if you like if you like european football slash soccer fifa is incredible yeah i love that game too have you been paying attention to the game design of that world of those worlds yeah and the thing people i think with those kind of games it is re like or racing games forza put up there i love forza played them all when you are have to recreate something that's real in the real world say it's cars or it's sports games everybody knows how it should work that's that's a really difficult task when people know how it should work then you're gonna balance it for single player the multiplayer parts of it keep very very competitive and you know in many respects you're forced to put out a new version every year and i say forced in quotes because they're you know count them as big updates but it's a very it's a much more difficult development process than i think people understand and how hard those teams work i know a lot of people who do it and i think they just do i've i've enjoyed them all i buy madden every year so yeah every single year yeah they do refresh it there's a feeling of freshness i don't know what that is yeah look there have been years where it feels like less was done and more was done but i i enjoy it every year yeah yeah what is a perfectly productive day in the life of todd howard look like so maybe not perfectly but just like a perfectly average productive what what are you a morning person evening person is it chaos is it pretty regular studio i'm in a good i'm in a good flow right now i'm still doing a lot of stuff so there's things i'm like executive producing and then you know starfield i'm directing so i sort of view that as that's an everyday thing fortunately i get to do a lot of stuff from look at the tv show we're making and this indiana jones game that's being developed the machine game so we have to look at that but you know the best really day or where i feel it's fulfilling is get to play some of a game the game we'll say starfield get to play some of starfield look at the problem set of what it is doing and then get in a room with the other developers that i work closely with and we solve that problem together so that's the most rewarding thing when you can say okay what do we want this to do what's the what's the real player experience we want what are all the pieces in front of us where you you know the actual tangible pieces as opposed to the beginning the pie in the sky part mhmm is always fun but it's like anything is possible that's fun but it's not rewarding in the same way because you haven't solved something whereas these are the elements you have to play with mhmm how do we make this all work together and you come out of it at the end of the day like now that feels great so brainstorming about specific big picture both big picture and and very specific detail of a game that's not work if something's not working you wanna fix it that kind of stuff and you just feel like okay you've made tangible progress on the actual build of the game mhmm or something you played in the beginning of the day didn't feel great you've figured out a solution with a group of people like it's always with a group and then the next day you're like yeah that was that worked out who's on the team is it designers engineers all the above artists voice over voice internal to the studio it's you know a lot of programming a lot of art you have design which breaks into some you know quest design writing systems design who are like doing all the treasure and the loot and the cyst and the skill systems yeah and then level design is making the spaces like those that you'll play through production is a big part of it the producers who organize everything i can't remember if i mentioned art a lot of artists qa staff as well they're hugely valuable in saying hey we broke your game in these magical ways what are you gonna do about it is the lou design team still hiring how do i apply that seems like the most fun job always i mean that at all of this it seems like a super fun job you know what it's the best then you have audio and it it it by far is is the greatest job you could possibly have and so if you're into like technology it's great if you're into storytelling creativity and art it's great and it's really the gaming you know the combination of that and like like i mentioned to you offline i think of video games is i mean to me it's brought thousands of hours of happiness and so when you're designing the game whatever you're doing you have a part to play in a thing that's going to bring like millions hundreds of millions of hours of happiness to people and you know crazy right it is and i'm gonna i'm gonna play play you saying that back to our team because you know people forget your heads down you're trying to solve these problems and then you do forget how many people it touches like even tiny decisions you make tiny little things you create yeah it's weird i wish there was a way to like i would notice things in a video game and it's like okay like the the it it feels good but you don't get that signal it the the creator doesn't get that signal i wish they did i guess you could get that signal by you know why is luck stuck in this room like digging through the loop in this get we do now get a lot of good data on what the players are doing enjoying and not that kind of we we know where they've been and where they've died and how long they play in certain sections and we can sort of tell outside of people just telling us on forums or calling or other things mhmm we can tell for some data where people are dropping off or having a you know we can tell if there's a key frustration point do you ever think about making people feel like human feelings when they play like designing like make them feel fear or excitement anger longing loneliness with stuff yeah of course the big one i like to say is the video games give you is pride outside of other you know if you watch movies or things like that like yeah but you never think like look what i did yes sir that feeling of like accomplishment and pride in what you did or you overcame you talked about going back to a game that like those are real feelings of like accomplishment that i've felt in games that i've played and when we get to see a player feel that it's really really special the other one is there is a you know there is an escape or to be someone else that's more powerful in what in our games that you are in real life that gives you a confidence or a perspective we're doing one next week we've done a number of make a wish visits kids who could wish for anything and they wanna come and i wanna see the next game and meet the creators and see how you do it and they come with their family and it is like the greatest thing that we do mhmm and it reminds you of like how important it is and the other really awesome thing is that you can see like the family change by the end of the day like they don't they didn't even realize what it meant to their child or what went into it and it's just that to me is like been been involved with that foundation for a number of years and it's been really good you know reminder of how lucky we are and in general for young people that sense of accomplishment is hard to find i mean yeah where they they don't not everybody has it in the outlets that real life provides well the that's the thing i mean the world is cruel to when you're young nobody takes you seriously you don't get like that's why you everybody always wants to grow up and get old as good as possible it's the hardest it's hard and then video games allow you i mean to build that sense of confidence sense of pride in something that's why when people talk down to video games like it's a culture and so on i it's it's not it misses out on that really deeply meaningful thing agreed especially with like single player there's some darker aspects to multiplayer that people create communities and you know it can it can go off the rails a bit but the actual experience of the game especially one we used stick with for a while that's that's really beautiful do you have advice for those same young folks given that your life is an interesting one given what kind of degree you got and being a legendary game designer do you have advice for young folks in high school maybe college how do i have a career or a life they can be proud of well you have to find something that you love so much that it's never gonna feel like a job and don't do it for money don't do it for find something you love and the rest of it will come it won't be a straight path and do not ever underestimate yourself it's gonna take hard work but the worst thing that young people do is think they can't accomplish something or they underestimate themselves and maybe those first few times through where they do fail if they love it enough they're gonna be resilient and and push past that anyone who's had success or gotten somewhere it's been they've had those times right and they've stayed resilient because they love it so much that this is what they wanna do when you do it for other reasons i just don't think it's gonna work out the same did you have low points in your life dark points or your your mind went to a dark place whether it's struggling to get a job at but as the soft works or maybe with the redguard flop or where you kind of started to doubt yourself or any of that well i think what's weird looking back i was so i was always so like in love with doing this mhmm that i didn't view them as like dark per se looking back i was like oh that was i just wanted to okay let me find a way to make this work mhmm even when it's hard and it's failing and all that kind of stuff you just kinda like it's a problem before you to solve yeah you know when i started bethesda i don't know my father had moved near nearby to the office i i was moving and you know i slept on a sofa like i didn't care like i don't need a bedroom i'll just i'll sleep on the sofa and work there that's all i wanna do when when the company almost went out of business it was well i hope it doesn't i feel somewhat responsible but hey let's okay that's a learning lesson let's go i think i was pretty resilient to it all fallout seventy six like really bad launch and okay what did we do wrong what can we learn let's go at it now it's a now it's a success but those kind of ups and downs for the length of developments that we have you know people don't see them but we have them you know all the time and so it's that sort of belief that you know with the team having done it time and time again to know that now we're gonna we're gonna make it as good as we possibly can and whatever we're experiencing now when we solve it and we get it out and you know we see the millions of people who love it it's all worth it and you're getting into new spaces first of all new worlds with starfield but also new i saw the tv show you're working on not on fallout with amazon mhmm what's that like worlds that you created in the digital realm becoming going on the screen yeah people asked you know i can remember ten years ago after fallout three was a hit you know movie producers coming and hey we think this will make a great movie and taking a lot of meetings and i think you know most of it would jump at that like sweet mhmm and i sort of paused and like i don't know what is this gonna do i felt like they're gonna like synthesize i met great people like well known creatives like it's gonna get synthesized into this two hour i don't know i'm not i'm not seeing the great thing here yet so you know i think the advent of television in terms of what it's become you know in in nowadays with big budget tv series it kinda came up again and met with people and jonathan nolan and lisa joy who do westworld and i always loved the work he did writing interstellar and the dark like movies i just love nolan is involved with this yeah he's the yeah he's the he's the ep and he's big directed the first incredible yeah yeah this is awesome and he he's the ep he's directed the first few episodes nice and and and when i connected with him jonah was like hey you know you're my you're the person i want to do this yeah so and then i met with people kept saying like you know just let me see if he wants to do it and i was to my joy he was like oh yeah fall three is one of my yep sign me up it was like no how do we get this done and at that time he was sort of he was at hbo and it was you know we were trying to figure out it was a put a little pause on it and you know got to visit the sets reading scripts and things like that it's all new to me but i they're doing such an incredible job like i think if you like this world you are gonna be just blown away so much so never made a tv show right you you know those are all the best you know no one ever does it wanting it to not be great but it they've just done their attention to detail and obsess they're just obsessive with what's on the screen and the storytelling and how it looks the whole the whole thing yeah i think obsession is really a a a prerequisite for greatness what they did hbo did with chernobyl like the attention to detail it's just like and and he's doing the last of us now mhmm that showrunner if if you really care and you really put a lot of effort into the details you can basically control it stunned they they i mean i don't wanna spoil it but when people see it i think they'll just be like wow it's the the other thing we're approaching it is very different where when it was people would say wanna make a movie they wanted to you know tell the story of fallout three or then tell the story of fallout four and for this it was hey let's do something that exists in the world of fallout it's not retelling a game story it's basically you know an area of the map and like let's tell a story here that fits in the world that we have built doesn't you know break any of the rules can reference things in the games but isn't a retelling of the games that exists in the same world but is its own unique thing so it adds to it while also people who don't haven't played the games who can't experience like how crazy cool fallout is can watch the series and so are there some similarities or interesting differences between the creation of a game and a tv show that you notice from the sort of story perspective well for them you know it's much more character driven like you can do all these things with the world and stuff that we already have it's the main characters who they are what their motivations are that really is the engine right there's no finding the right actors to do those yeah because you're not there's no interaction there's no you don't get to enter that world they have to do the work for you the mpcs are on the show yeah i can't wait to see how it turns out you also mentioned indiana jones that's a weird that's a different one how do you work with a like a with a famous protagonist like when the character is known how do you work with that well it's different it's different like indiana jones is different where like the name he it is the like it's indiana jones not a world it's him mhmm right you can talk about the world of indiana jones but at the end of the day it's about this character mhmm and raiders still my favorite movie of all time no debate it's the best movie ever best movie ever ever yeah on a tangent what do you love about it well you know i saw it obviously when i was younger and i believed it i believed this happened and when they found the arc i literally i i could not believe that they found it so and i have found over my life it's still really watchable every time i enjoy it every single time love the character love the story the opening is the greatest movie opening ever and i just love everything i love everything about it what was the opening is this when the what it's the the temple and then the ball rolls and tries to crush him oh that's the the opening of raiders yeah he steals the okay idol i think you're you're deeply offended i was like what's the opening of raiders so i've always wanted to it's one of those things like what's on your bucket list like i wanna make an indiana jones game and i had pitched lucas i had met some people there and pitched them back in o nine this indiana jones game concept and they wanted to publish it's kind of the deal fell apart they wanted to publish it and we were a publisher and so we we didn't do it and i didn't really have the team to do it i just was gonna figure that out after we agreed to a deal and well you know we made skyrim so it worked out and then you know fast forward ten years plus and you know lucas now part of disney and they're doing a lot more of licensing and working with people and so i knew some folks there and said i have this idea that i pitched a long time ago and they loved it and again the internal team that i had not only didn't have the time they probably weren't as good a fit as machinegames who's done the wolfenstein series who is the perfect fit for this game with storytelling and how they record it and they are it's awesome they're just doing an incredible job with that game it's people are gonna be if you like indiana jones it is it is a definite love letter to indiana jones and everything with it can you say if it's a little if it's more on the action adventure like side like the actual experience of the game i could go back i would just say it is a mashup it is a unique it isn't one thing intentionally so it does a lot of different things that you know we've myself and and and jurek and the folks at machinegames have wanted to to do in a game so it's it's a it's a unique thing be before i forget who do i how many humans do i have to kill i mean dragons do i have to kill to get myself somehow into elder scrolls six it's a mod if anyone wants to create mods of me and is that is that possible yeah that's possible while maintaining realism somehow you don't want you don't want a person in a suit and tie doesn't make sense put you in put you in fallout you can wear you can wear you can wear that yeah exact out please put me so fallout is there's also a culture of you do a mod where you replace the mysterious stranger mhmm there you go that's the to do task top top top mod right there and you will have my deep gratitude and more dear stranger for doing so what's the programming language for mods is it mostly they use our internal scripting language that's built into the tool okay i'm almost afraid to explore that world because you will never never never turn back how long you've created so so many incredible games is there what does the future hold do you is there so so going through this process do you still have the energy the passion the drive to keep creating i i cannot imagine doing anything else i'd like to do it as long as possible i will say though as i've done it you know soon it'll be thirty years at bethesda i've learned that to appreciate the developments a little bit more you know that the the time it takes i should re i should prioritize all of us enjoying the development process more than i did in the past it was like you know just wanted to to end that's all that mattered yeah and the more you do it you realize no i'm i'm spending the majority of my life in in tamriel and the wasteland and fallout so you know the moments that we're all doing this together we need to enjoy it like it's a lot of work finishing starfield but hey we gotta enjoy this this is like incredible we don't get that many shots so so the actual process of creating the struggles along the way of stuff not working like like you said at this point it was starfield probably creating some of the glue of how stuff feels and going back again and again and again to try to make the beginning better all that kind of stuff and i would say it for anybody's vocation whatever you're doing you know whatever people do you're gonna have harder times mhmm and sometimes people it's you know be yeah you had to you know maybe recalibrate yourself to like okay how can we make this more enjoyable for all of us no matter what you're doing and rewarding so if life is a video game which most likely is what do you think is the meaning of life from having created so many games where the character has to try to figure out i mean there's bigger questions than just solving the quest you're big asking the big questions of why am i here i feel like that's good practice for answering the same question for this video game we're in what do you think is the meaning of life todd howard doesn't worry i can say what motivates me that's a good start having a curiosity you know the ability to not assume a lot and be curious about the world around you it's it's more it's you know not the same as just wanting to learn everything but what makes other humans tick how do they feel how do they love it might be cliche to say the meaning of life is to love right so that curiosity is just is about i i noticing the the world noticing the world around you you know look there's so much an anecdote someone says everybody has two lives and the second one starts when you realize there's only one and i think i usually preach to my children everything else like have a curiosity to the world around you and you'll have the most fulfilling days are you able to be inside the worlds that you've created and be able to notice them like really like really enjoy them it takes time so like skyrim had its tenth anniversary and so when i went back into it i think i got to see it for what it is my younger son got really into it if you know a a few years back on the switch mhmm that's when we noticed people age up into it right so one of the reasons it's so popular is you know some people come into you know yeah they're now becoming you know teenagers and oh okay i'll finally play skyrim and you know he got obsessed with it not and he wasn't usually i say hey check out my games and they're like ah shut up dad we don't we're playing this other stuff and he got like obsessed with skyrim like we're having like deep elder scrolls lore conversations at dinner mhmm and you know i saw it through his eyes and that was pretty special and then the mods he was downloading and the youtubers he was following talking about stuff so the people who like the elder scrolls people don't realize how much of that i have watched with my son yeah and then i kind of when the tenth anniversary came out like oh i'm gonna you know check out a bill i have to check out the build out but i hadn't played it in so long and it was like it does it has this flow where like oh my god i just played for four hours i need to i i need to turn it off yeah i mean there's something about enjoying enjoying video games with the people you love too or the the the the water cooler discussion and with kids so i actually i would love to have kids and hopefully soon in the future so i guess the thing i need your advice on is how do i time in a such a way when they're old enough right at the age they're old enough like i i wanna know when to have them so that when they're old enough that's exactly when elder scrolls six comes out i wanna can you give me a hint when i should have kids alright never mind you are a genius yeah at how to ask that question the number of times yeah you told the anecdote that your that your son asked you the same question but but of course it's all for good fun take as much time as is needed it's skyrim is still an incredible game it has an impact on millions of people as as as do all of your games it's it's thank you for everything you've done for the world thank you it's a huge honor that you would talk with me there it's this has been an honor and you know that has to be said look it's i have a huge team of people i've worked with for some of them for twenty years and it's really all of us together keep doing a great job guys and gals i can't wait to see what you create next it really really does have an impact on silly kids like me and millions of silly kids like me so i really appreciate everything thank
