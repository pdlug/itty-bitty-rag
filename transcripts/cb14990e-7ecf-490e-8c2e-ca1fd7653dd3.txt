the following is a conversation with mark reibert a legendary roboticist founder and longtime ceo of boston dynamics and recently the executive director of the newly created boston dynamics ai institute that focuses on research and the cutting edge on creating future generations of robots that are far better than anything that exists today he has been leading the creation of incredible legged robots for over forty years at cmu at mit the legendary mit leg lab and then of course boston dynamics with amazing robots like bigdog atlas spot and handle this was a big honor and pleasure for me and now a quick few second mention of a sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this podcast we got hidden layer for securing your ai and machine learning models

you skip them please still check out the sponsors i enjoy their stuff maybe you will too this episode is brought to you by a new sponsor an amazing sponsor called hidden layer it's a platform that provides security for your machine learning models if you've been paying any attention it's obvious that generative ai machine learning ai in general is going to transform basically every single industry if you're starting a business if you're running a business there's probably a lot of ways that language models or any of these generative system could be used to help automate certain things to help empower certain things improve certain things all that kind of stuff to work together with humans to improve the productivity now what comes with great powerful new technology is security threats there's always bad guys out there and they wanna find ways in adversarial attacks they wanna trick you you need experts to help you incorporate the machine learning models that you're using in a secure way that's what hidden layer does i think that's really interesting because the kinds of attacks on machine learning models is going to be really really interesting because one way to do that is if you look at a model zoo repository like hugging face for example one way is to get a model in there that looks legit but has weirdnesses to it that are hard to discover until they're actually way down the line being used at a large scale so that's like one way to do it the other way is to do outside repositories and deliver the models that look legit but again in subtle ways difficult to detect ways it will look legit at first it will look functional and correct at first but then the kind of malware inside the machine will emerge down the line so you want experts to be considering this rapidly evolving security threat that is latent within machine learning systems visit hidden layer dot com slash lex to learn more about hidden layer these guys are great they're great sponsors of this podcast they do a really important service for the whole machine learning community so check them out this episode is brought to you by babbel an app and website that gets you speaking in a new language within weeks russian spanish french german italian portuguese and more i can keep going but those are the ones i wanna speak german italian i wanna at least order stuff in italian or restaurant and that's the kind of stuff you can learn with babbel really quick it's like practical conversational stuff so when you're traveling you can use it portuguese obviously you know i practice a martial art called brazilian jiu jitsu portuguese brazil i gotta do it spanish same thing i'm a huge fan of soccer aka football and of course dream of one day interviewing some of these said soccer players and the other languages like russian we're going to try to do a bunch of different translation and overdubbing very very soon the various podcast conversations i've been doing i think one of the most powerful way to bridge barriers between people is breaking through the wall that language creates automated translation and then when you actually meet them in person to speak their language or to attempt to speak their language that's what again babbel is great for i use it all the languages i mentioned i've used it to learn that even to practice my russian for a limited time get fifty

our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's marc reibert when did you first fall in love with robotics well i was always a builder from a from a young age i was i was lucky my father was a frustrated engineer and by that i mean he wanted to be an aerospace engineer but his mom from the old country thought that that would be like a grease monkey and so she said no so he became an accountant but the but the result of that was our basement was always full of tools and equipment and electronics and you know from a young age i would watch him assembling a kit an iko kit or something like that i still have a couple of his old iko kits and but it was really during graduate school when i followed a professor back from class it was bertolt horner at mit and i was taking an interim class it's iap independent activities period mhmm and i followed him back to his lab and on the table was a vyke arm robot arm taken apart in probably a thousand pieces and when i saw that you know from that day on i was a roboticist do you remember the year nineteen seventy four nineteen seventy four so there's just this arm in pieces yeah and you you saw the pieces and you saw in your in your vision the the the arm when it's back put back together and the possibilities that holds somehow it it spurred my imagination i hit i was in the brain and cognitive sciences department as a graduate student doing neurophysiology i'd been a electrical engineer as an undergrad at northeastern and the neurophysiology wasn't really working for me you know i it wasn't conceptual enough i couldn't see really how by looking at single neurons you were gonna get to a place where you could understand you know control systems or thought or anything like that and you know the ai lab was always an appealing this was before csail right this was in the seventies so the ai lab was always an appealing idea and so when i went back to the ai lab with you know following him and i saw the arm i just thought you know this is it it's so interesting the tension between the the the bcs brain cognitive science approach to understanding intelligence and the robotics approach to understanding intelligence well bcs has now morphed a bit right they they have the center for brains minds and machines which is trying to bridge that gap and even when i was there you know david marr was in the ai lab david marr had models of the brain that were appealing both to biologists but also to computer people so he was a visitor in the ai lab at the time and i guess he became full time there so that was the first time a bridge was made between those two groups then the bridge kinda went away and then there was another time in the eighties and then recently you know the last five or so years there's been a a stronger connection you said you were always kind of a builder what stands out to you in memory of a thing you've built maybe a trivial thing that just kinda like inspired inspired you in the possibilities that this direction of work might hold i mean we were just doing gadgets when we were kids yes you know i have a friend we were taking you know the i don't know if everybody remembers but fluorescent lights had this little aluminum cylinder i can't even remember what it's called now that you needed a starter i think it was and we would take those apart fill them with match heads put a tail on it and make it into little rockets so it wasn't always about function it was well well rocket was pretty pretty much functional that is pretty functional but yeah i guess that is a question how much was it about function versus just creating something cool i think it's a it's still a balance between those two there was a time though when i was i guess i was probably already a professor or maybe late in graduate school when i thought that function was everything and that you know mobility dexterity perception and intelligence those are sort of the function the key functionalities for robotics that that's what mattered and nothing else mattered and i even had the kind of this platonic ideal that a robot if you just looked at a robot and it wasn't doing anything it would look like a pile of junk which a lot of my robots looked like in those in those days but then when it started moving you'd get the idea that it you know it had some kind of life or some kind of interest in its movement and i think if we purposely even designed the machines not not worrying about the aesthetics of the of the structure itself but then but then you know it turns out that the aesthetics of the thing itself add and combine with the lifelike things that the robots can do but the heart of it is you know making them do things that are that are interesting so one of the things that underlies a lot of your work is that the robots you create the systems you have created for for over forty years now have a kind of they're not cautious so a lot of robots that people know about move about this world very cautiously carefully very afraid of the world a lot of the robots you built especially in the early days were very aggressive under actuated they're hopping they're they're wild moving quickly so what is there a philosophy underlying that well let me tell you about how i got started on legs at all i when i was still a graduate student i went to a conference it was a biological legged locomotion conference so i think it was in philadelphia so it's all biomechanics people you know researchers who would look at muscle and maybe neurons and things like that they weren't so much computational people but they were more biomechanics and maybe there were a thousand people there and i went to a talk one of the talks all the talks were about the body of either animals or people and respiration things like that but one talk was by a robotics guy mhmm and he showed a six legged robot that walked very slowly it always had at least three feet on the ground so it worked like a table or a chair with tripod stability and it moved really slowly and i just looked at that and said wow that's wrong you know that's not that's not anything like how people and animals work because we bounce and fly you know we have to predict what's gonna happen in order to keep our balance when we're taking a running step or something like that we use the springiness in our in our legs you know our muscles and our tendons and things like that as part of the story you know the energy circulates we don't just throw it away mhmm every time so and i i'm not sure i understood all that when i first thought but i i definitely got inspired to say you know let's try the opposite and i didn't have a clue as to how to make a hopping robot work not real you know not balanced in three d in fact when i started it was all just about the energy of bouncing and i was gonna have a springy thing in the leg and some actuator so that you could get an energy regime going of bouncing and the idea that balance was an important part of it didn't come until a little later and then you know i made the the one legged the pogo stick robots mhmm now i think that we need to do that in manipulation if you look at robot manipulation we've been working we a community has been working on it for fifty years we're nowhere near human levels of manipulation i mean we can you know it's come along but i think it's all too safe and i think trying to break out of that safety thing of static grasping you know if you look at the a lot of work that goes on it's about the geometry of the part and then and then you figure out how to move your hand so that you can position it with respect to that and then you grasp it carefully and then you move it well that's not anything like how people and animals work you know we juggle in our hands we hug multiple objects and can sort them so now to be fair being more aggressive is gonna mean things aren't gonna work very well for a while so it's a long it's a longer term approach to the problem but that and that's just theory now you know maybe that won't pay off but that's sort of how i'm trying to think about it trying to encourage our group to to go at it well yeah i mean we'll talk about what it means to what what is the actual thing we're trying to optimize in for a robot you know sometimes especially human robot interaction maybe flaws is a good thing perfection is not necessarily the right thing to be chasing just like you said maybe maybe being good at fumbling an object being good at fumbling might be the right thing to optimize versus perfect modeling of the object and perfect movement of the arm to grasp that object because maybe perfection is not supposed to exist in the real world i don't know if you know my friend matt mason who's who is the director of the robotics institute at carnegie mellon and we go back to graduate school together but he analyzed a movie of julia childs doing a cooking thing and she did i think he said something like there were forty different ways that she handled the thing and none of them was grasping he would she would nudge roll flatten with her you know knife things like that and none of them was grasping so okay let's go back to the early days first of all you've you've created and led the the leg lab the legendary leg lab at mit so what what was that first hopping robot can you but first of all the leg lab actually started at carnegie mellon carnegie mellon so i was a professor there starting in nineteen eighty in to about nineteen eighty six and so that's where the first topping machines were built starting i i guess we got the first one working in about nineteen eighty two something like that that was a simplified one then we got a three-dimensional one in nineteen eighty three the quadruped that we built at the leg lab the first version was built in about nineteen eighty four or five and really only got going about eighty six or so and it took years of development to get it to let's just pause here for people who don't know i'm talking to mark raeburg founder of boston dynamics but before that you were a professor developing some of the most incredible robots for fifteen years and before that of course a grad student and all that so you've been doing this for a really long time so we you like skipped over this but like go go to the first hopping robot there's videos of some of this i mean these are incredible robots so you talked about the the very first step was to get a thing hopping up and down right and then you realized well balancing is a thing you should care about and it's actually a solvable problem so can you just go through how to create that robot what what sure what was involved in creating that robot well i'm gonna start on the not the technical side mhmm but the i guess we could call it the motivational side or the funding side so before carnegie mellon i was actually at jpl at the jet propulsion lab for three years and while i was there i connected up with ivan sutherland who is sometimes regarded as the father of computer graphics because of work he did both at mit and then university of utah and evanston so on anyway i got to know him and at one point he said he encouraged me to do some kind of project at caltech even though i was at jpl you know those are kind of related institutions and so i i thought about it and i made up a list of three possible projects mhmm and i purposely made the top one and the bottom one really boring sounding and in the middle i put pogo stick robot and when he looked at it you know ivan is a a brilliant brilliant guy brilliant engineer and a real cultivator of people he looked at it and knew right away what the thing that was worth doing so he had an endowed share so he had about three thousand dollars that he gave me to build the first model which i went to the shop and with my own hands kind of made a first model which which didn't work and was just you know a a beginning shot at it and ivan and i took that to washington and in those days you could just walk into darpa and walk down the hallway and see who's there yeah ivan who had been there in his previous life and so we walked around and we looked in the offices of course i didn't know anything you know i was basically a kid but ivan knew his way around and we found craig fields in his office craig later became the director of darpa but in those days he was a program manager and so we went in i had his little samsonite suitcase we we opened and it had just the skeleton of this one legged hopping robot and we showed it to him and you could almost see the drool going down his chin does he excite of excitement and he sent me two hundred and fifty thousand dollars he said okay i'll i wanna fund this and i was between institutions i was just about to leave jpl and i hadn't decided yet where i was going next and then when i landed at cmu he sent two hundred and fifty thousand dollars which in nineteen eighty was a lot of a lot of research money did you see the possibility of where this is going why this is an important problem no the balance i mean it's legged it it has to do with legged locomotion i mean it has to do with all these problems that that that are that the human body solves when we're walking for example like all the fundamentals are there yeah i mean i think that was the motivation to try and get more at the fundamentals of how animals work but the idea that it would result in you know machines that were anything like practical like we're making now that that wasn't anywhere in my head no you know as an academic i was mostly just trying to do the next thing you know make some progress impress my colleagues if i could and have fun and have fun pogo stick robot pogo stick robot so what was on the technical side what are the some of the challenges of getting up getting to the point where we saw like in the video the the pogo stick robot that's actually successfully hopping and then eventually doing flips and all this kind of stuff well in the very early days i needed some better engineering than i had than i could do myself and i hired ben brown we we each had our way of contributing to the design and we came up with a thing that could could start to work i had some stupid ideas about how the actuation system should work and we sorted that out it wasn't that hard to make it balanced once you get the physical machine to be working well enough and have enough control over the degrees of freedom and then we very quickly you know we started out by having it floating on a inclined air table and then that only gave us like six foot of travel so once it started working we switched to a thing that could run around the room on another device it's hard to explain these without you seeing them but you you probably know what i'm talking about mhmm a planarizer and and then the next big step was to make it work in three d which that was really the scary part with these simple things you know people had inverted pendulums at the time for for years and they could control them by driving a cart back and forth but could you make it work in three dimensions while it's bouncing and all that and but it turned out you know not to be that hard to do at least at the level of performance we achieved at the time so okay you mentioned inverted pendulum but like can you explain how a hopping stick in three d can control can balance itself yes what what what does the actuation look like you know the simple story is that there's three things going on there's something making it bounce and you know we we had a system that was estimating how high the robot was off the ground and using that you know there's energy that can be in three places in a in a pogo stick stick one is in the spring one is in the altitude and the other is in the velocity and so when at the top of the hop it's all in the the height and so you could just measure how high you're going and thereby thereby have an idea of a lot about the cycle and you could decide whether to put more energy in or less so that is one element then there's a part that you decide where to put the foot and if you think when you're landing on the ground with respect to the center of mass so if you think of a pole vaulter the key thing the pole vaulter has to do is get its body to the right place when the pole gets stuck if they're too far forward they kind of get thrown backwards if they're too far back they go you know over and what they need to do is get it so that they go mostly up to get over the thing and you know high jumpers is the same kind of thing so there's a calculation about where to put the foot and we did something you know relatively simple and then there's a third part to keep the body at an attitude that's upright because if it gets too far you know you could hop and just keep rotating around but if it gets too far then you run out of motion of the joints at the hips so you have to do that and we did that by applying a torque between the legs and the body every time the foot's on the ground you only can do it while the foot's on the ground in the air the physics don't work out how far does it have to tilt before it's too late to be able to balance itself or it's impossible to balance itself correct itself well you're you're asking an interesting question because in those days we didn't actually optimize things and they probably could have gone much further than we did and then had higher performance and we just kind of got you know a sketch of a solution and worked on that and then in years since some people working for us some people working for others people came up with all kinds of equations for or you know algorithms for how to do a better job be able to go faster one of my students worked on getting things to go faster another one worked on climbing over obstacles because when you're running it's one on the open ground it's one thing if you're running like up a stair you have to adjust where you are otherwise things don't work out right you land your foot on the edge of the steps so there's other degrees of freedom to control if you're getting to more realistic practical situations i think it's really interesting to ask about the early days because believing in yourself believing that there's something interesting here and then you mentioned find finding somebody else ben brown what's that like finding other people with whom you can build this crazy idea and actually make it work probably the smartest thing i ever did is to find the other people yeah i mean when i look at it now you know i look at boston dynamics so when you talk about pogo stick robot or legged robots whether it's quadrupeds or humanoid robots did people doubt that this is possible did you experience a lot of people around you kinda i don't i don't know if they doubted whether it was possible but i think they thought it was a waste of time oh it's not even an interesting problem there were i think for a lot of people you know people who were i think it's been it's been both though some people i think i felt like they were saying oh why are you wasting your time on this stupid problem but then i've been at many things where people have told me it's been an inspiration to to go out and you know attack these these harder things and and i think it has turned out i think legged locomotion has turned out to be a useful thing did you ever have like doubt about bringing atlas to life for example or or or with bigdog just every step of the way did you have doubt like what what this is this is too hard of a problem i mean at first i wasn't an enthusiast for the humanoids because again it goes back to saying what's the functionality and the form wasn't as important as the functionality and i and also you know there's a an aspect to humanoid robots that's about all about the cosmetics where there isn't really other functionality and that kind of is off putting for me as a roboticist i think the functionality really matters so probably that's why i avoided human robots humanoid robots to start with but i'll tell you now you know after we started working on them you could see that the imp the connection and the impact with with other people whether they're laypeople or even other technical people there's a special thing that goes on even though most of the humanoid robots aren't that much like a person but we anthropomorphize and we see that's right the humanity but also like with with spot you can see not the humanity but whatever we find compelling about social interactions they're in spot as well i'll tell you you know i go around giving talks and take spot to to a lot of them and it's amazing the media likes to say that they're terrifying and that people are afraid and youtube commenters like to say that it's frightening but when you take a spot out there now maybe it's self selecting but you get a crowd of people who wanna take pictures wanna pose for selfies wanna operate the robot wanna pet it wanna put clothes on it it's amazing yeah i love the spot so if we move around history a little bit so you said i think in the early days of boston dynamics that you quietly worked on making a running version of aibo yeah yeah sony's robot dog yeah it's just an interesting little tidbit of history for me what what what like what stands out to your memory from that task for people who don't know that little dog robot moves slowly how did that become big dog what was involved there what was the dance between how do we make this cute little dog versus a thing that can actually carry a lot of payload and move fast and stuff like that what the connection was is that at that point boston dynamics was mostly a physics based simulation company so when i left mit to start boston dynamics you know there was a few years of overlap but the concept wasn't to start a robot company the concept was to use this dynamic simulation tool that we developed to do robotics to for other things but working with sony we got back into robotics by doing the aibo runner by we programmed we made some tools for programming curio which was a small a humanoid this big that could do some dancing and and other kinds of fun stuff and i don't think it ever reached the market even though they they did show it you know when i look back i say that we got us back where we belonged yep you rediscovered the soul of the company that's right and so from there it was always about robots yep so you started boston dynamics in nineteen ninety two right what are some fond memories from the early days one of the robots that we built wasn't wasn't actually a robot it was a surgical simulator but it had force feedback so it had all the techniques of robotics mhmm and you looked down into this mirror it actually was and it looked like you were looking down onto the body you were working on your hands were underneath the mirror so there were where you were looking and you had tools in your hands that were connected up to these force feedback devices made by another mit spin out sensible technologies so they made the force feedback device we attached the tools and we brought all the software and did all the graphics so we had three d computer graphics it was in the old days when this was in the late nineties when you had the silicon graphics computer that was about this big mhmm you know it was the heater in the office basically nice right and we were doing surgical operations anastomosis which was stitching tubes together you know tubes like blood vessels or other things in their body and you could feel and you could see the tissues move and it was really exciting and the idea was to make a trainer to teach surgeons how to do stuff we built a scoring system because we interviewed surgeons that told us what you're supposed to do and what you're not supposed to do you're not supposed to tear the tissue you're not supposed to touch it in any place except for where you're trying to engage there were a bunch of rules mhmm so we built this thing and took it to a trade show a surgical trade show and the surgeons were practically lined up well we we kept the score and we posted their scores like on a video game and those guys are so competitive that they really really love doing it and they would come around and they see someone's score was higher there so they would come back but we figured out shortly after that we thought surgeons were gonna pay us to get trained on these things and the surgeons thought we should pay them in order to so they could teach us about the thing and there was no money from the surgeons yeah and we looked at it and thought well maybe we could sell it to hospitals that would teach train their surgeons and then we said well we're this at the time we were probably a twelve person company or maybe fifteen people i don't remember there was no way we could go after a marketing activity you know the company was all bootstrapped in those years we we never had investors until google bought us and which was after twenty years so we didn't have any resources to to go after hospitals so we at one sort of at one day rob and i were looking at that and we said we'd built another simulator for knee arthroscopy mhmm and we said this isn't gonna work and we killed it and we moved on and that was really a milestone in the company because we you know we sort of understood who we were and and what would work and what wouldn't even though technically it was really a fascinating thing what was that meeting like were you just like sitting at a table you know what probably we're going to pivot completely we're going to let go of this thing we put so much hard work into and then go back to the thing it just always felt right when unless we did it you know just look at each other and said let's let's build robots yeah what was the first robot you built under the the flag of boston dynamics big dog well there was the aibo runner but it wasn't even a whole robot it was just legs that we we took off the legs on aibos and attached legs we'd made and you know we got that working and showed it to the sony people we worked pretty closely with sony in those years one of the interesting things is that it was before the internet and zoom and anything like that mhmm so we had six isdn lines installed and we would have a telecom every week that worked at very low frame rate something like ten hertz you know english across the boundary with japan was a challenge trying to understand what what each of us was saying and have meetings every week for for several years doing that and it was a pleasure working with them they were really supporters they they seemed to like us and what we were doing that was the real transition from us being a simulation company into being a robotics company again it was a quadruped the the legs were four legs or two legs yeah no four legs yeah and what did you learn from that experience of building a basically a fast moving quadruped mostly we learned that something that small doesn't look very exciting when it's running it's like it's scampering and you had to you had to watch a slow mo for it to look like it was interesting if you watch it fast it was just like a that's funny one of my things was to show stuff in video from the very early days of the hopping machines and so i was always focused on how's this gonna look through the viewfinder and running aibo didn't look so cool through the viewfinder so what what came next in terms of what was a big next milestone in terms of the robot you built i mean you gotta say that bigdog was you know sort of put us on the map and got our heads really pulled together we scaled up the company big dog was the result of alan rudolph at darpa starting a biodynamics program and he put out a you know a request for proposals and i think there were forty two proposals written and three got funded one was bigdog one was a climbing robot ryze and you know that put things in motion we we hired martin buehler he was a a professor at in montreal at mcgill he was incredibly important for getting big dog out of the lab and into the mud which is you know was a key step to really be willing to go out there and and build it break it fix it which is sort of one of our mottos at the company so testing it in the real world testing for people who don't know bigdog maybe you can correct me but it's a it's a big quadruped four legged robot that it looks big could probably carry a lot of weight not the most weight that boston dynamics have built but a lot well it's the first thing that worked so let's see if we go back to the leg lab we built a quadruped that could do many of the things that bigdog did but it had a hydraulic pump sitting in the room with hoses connected to the robot it had a vax computer in the next room it needed its own room because it was this giant thing with air conditioning and it had this very complicated bus connected to the robot and the robot itself just had the actuators it had gyroscopes for sensing and other some other sensors but all the power and computing was off board bigdog had all that stuff integrated on the platform it had a gasoline engine for power which was a very complicated thing to to undertake it had to convert the rotation of the engine into hydraulic power which is how we actuated it so there was a lot of learning just on the you know building the physical robot and and the system integration for that and then there was the controls of it so for bigdog we brought it all together onto one platform right and then so you could you could you could take it out in the woods yeah and you did we did we spent a lot of time down at the marine corps base in quantico where there was a trail called the guadalcanal trail and our milestone that darpa had specified was that we could go on this one particular trail that involved you know a lot of challenge and we spent a lot of time our team spent a lot of time down there those were fun days hiking with a robot hiking with a robot hiking with a robot hiking with a robot what what what did you learn about like what it takes to balance a robot like that on a trail on a hiking trail in the woods basically forget the woods just the real world that's the big leap into testing in the real world yeah as challenging as the woods were mhmm working inside of a home or in an office is really harder yeah because when you're in the woods you can actually take any path up the up the hill all you have to do is avoid the obstacles you there's no such thing as damaging the woods at least you know to first order whereas if you're in a house you can't leave scuff marks you can't bang into the walls the robots aren't very comfortable bumping into the walls especially in the early days so i think those were actually bigger challenges once once we faced them it was mostly you know getting the systems to work well enough together the the hardware systems to work and the controls in those days we did have a human operator who did all the visual perception going up the guadalcanal trail so there was an operator who was right there who was very skilled at even though the robot was balancing itself and placing its own feet if the operator didn't do the right thing it wouldn't go but years later we went back with one of the electric the precursor to spot and we had advanced the controls and everything so much that an amateur complete amateur could operate the robot the first time up and down and up and down whereas it had taken us years to to get there in the previous robot so if you fast forward bigdog eventually became spot so bigdog became ls three which is the big load carrying one just just a quick pause it can carry four hundred pounds it was designed to carry four hundred but we had it carrying about a thousand pounds at one time of course you did just to make sure we had one carrying the other one we had two of them so we had one carrying the other one there's a little clip of that we should put that out somewhere that's from like twenty years ago but wow wow and it it can go for very long distances it can travel twenty miles yeah gasoline gasoline yeah and that that event is just okay sorry so ls three then what how did that lead to spot so bigdog and ls three had engine power and hydraulic actuation then we made a robot that was electric power so there's a battery driving a motor driving a pump but still hydraulic actuation yeah larry sort of asked us could you make something that weighed sixty pounds that would not be so intimidating if you had it in a house where there were people and that was the inspiration behind the spot pretty much as it exists today we did a prototype the same size that was the first all electric non elect non hydraulic robot what was the conversation with larry page like about so here's a guy that kinda is very product focused and can can see a vision for like what the future holds that's just interesting kinda aside what was the brainstorm about the future robotics with him like i mean it was almost as simple as what i just said he you know we're having a meeting he said yeah jeez could you know do you think you could make a smaller one that wouldn't be so intimidating like a big dog yeah if it was in your house and i said yeah we could do that we started and did is there a lot of technical challenges to go from hydraulic to electric you know i had been in love with hydraulics and still love hydraulics you know it's it's a great technology it's too bad that the somehow the the world out there looks at it like it's old fashioned or that it's icky and it's true that you do it is very hard to keep it from having some amount of dripping from time to time but if you look at the performance you know how strong you can get in a lightweight package and of course we did a huge amount of innovation most of hydraulic control that is the valve that controls the flow of oil had been designed in the fifties for airplanes it had been made robust enough safe enough that you could count on it so that humans could fly in airplanes and very little innovation had happened you know that might not be fair to the people who make the valves i'm sure that they did innovate but the basic design had stayed the same and there was so much more you could do and so our engineers designed valves the ones that are in atlas for instance that had new kinds of circuits they sort of did some of the computing that could get you much more efficient use they were much smaller and lighter so that the whole robot could be smaller and lighter we made a hydraulic power supply that had a bunch of components integrated in this tiny package it's about this big you know the size of a football weighs five kilograms and it produces five kilowatts of power of course it has to have a battery operating but it's got a motor a pump filters heat exchanger to keep it cool some valves all of all in this tiny little package so hydraulics you know could still have a ways to go one of the things that stands out about the robots boston and amos have created is how beautiful the movement is how natural the walking is and running is even flipping with throwing is so maybe you can talk about what what's involved in making it look natural well i think having good hardware is part of the story and people who think you don't need to innovate hardware anymore are wrong in my opinion so i think one of the things certainly in the early years for me taking a dynamic approach where you think about what's the evolution of the motion of the thing going to be in the future and having a prediction of that that's used at the time that you're giving signals to it as opposed to it all being servoing which is servoing is sort of backward looking it says okay where am i now i'm gonna i'm gonna try and adjust for that but you really need to think about what's coming so how far ahead do you do you have to look in time it's interesting i think that the number is only a couple of seconds for spot so there's a limited horizon type approach where you're recalculating assuming what's gonna happen in the next second or second and a half and then you keep iterating you know at the next even though a tenth of a second later you'll say okay let's do that again and see what's happening and you're looking at what the obstacles are where the feet are gonna be placed how to you know you have to coordinate a lot of things if you have obstacles and you're balancing at the same time and it's that limited horizon type calculation that's doing a lot of that but if you're doing something like a somersault you're looking out a lot further right if you want to stick the landing you have to get the you have to at the time of launch have you know momentum and rotation all those things coordinated so that a landing is within reach how hard is it to stick a landing i mean it's very much underactuated like you once you've in the air you don't have as much control about anything so how hard is it to get that to work you first of all did flips with a hopping robot if you look at the first time we ever made a robot do a somersault it was in a planar robot you know it had a boom so it could only it was restricted to the surface of a sphere we call that planar so it could move fore and aft it could go up and down and it could rotate and so the calculation of what you need to do to get a to stick a landing isn't all that complicated you have to look at you know you have to get time to make the rotation so how hard you jump how high you jump gives you time you look at how quickly you can rotate and so you know if you get those two right then when you land you have the feet in the right place and you have to get rid of all that rotational and linear momentum but that's not too hard to figure out we made back in about nineteen eighty five or six i can't remember we had a simple robot doing somersaults to do it in three d really the calculation is the same you just have to be balancing in the other degrees of freedom if you're just doing a somersault it's just a a planar thing roy and rob was my graduate student and we were at mit which is when we made you know a two legged robot do a three d somersault for the first time there in order to get enough rotation rate you needed to do tucking also you know withdraw the legs in order to accelerate it and he did some really fascinating work on how you stabilize more complicated maneuvers remember he was a gymnast a champion gymnast before he'd come to me so he had he had the physical abilities and he was an engineer so he could translate some of that into the math and the algorithms that you need to to do that he knew how humans do it you just have to get robots to do the same unfortunately though when you humans don't really know how they do it yeah right we're coached we have ways of learning but do we really understand in a physics way what we're doing probably most gymnasts and athletes don't know so in some way by building robots you are in part understanding how humans do like walking most of us walk without considering how we walk really right and how we make it so natural and efficient and all those kinds of things atlas still doesn't walk like a person and it still doesn't walk quite as gracefully as a person even though it's been getting closer and closer the running might be close to a human but the walking is still a a challenge that's interesting right the that running is closer to a human it just shows that the more aggressive and kind of the more you leap into the unknown the more natural it is i mean walking is kind of falling always right and something weird about the knee that you can kind of do this folding and unfolding and get it to work out just a human can get it to work out just right there's compliances compliance means springiness in the in the design that are important to how it all works well we used to have a motto at boston dynamics in the early days which was you have to run before you can walk that's a that's a good motto because you also had wildcat mhmm which was one of the along the way towards spot which is a quadruped that went nineteen miles an hour right on flat terrain is that the fastest you've ever built oh yeah might be the fastest quadruped in the world i don't know for a quadruped probably of course it was probably the loudest too so we had this little racing go kart engine on it and we would get people from you know three buildings away sending us you know complaining about how loud it was so at the leg lab i believe most of the robots didn't have knees how what's the how do you figure out what is the right number of actuators what what are the joints to have what do you need to have you know we humans have knees and all kinds of interesting stuff on the feet the toe is an important part i guess for humans or maybe it's not i injured my toe recently and it made running very unpleasant mhmm so that seems to be kind of important so how do you figure out for efficiency for function for aesthetics mhmm how many joints to have how many actuators to have well it's always a balance between wanting to get where you really wanna get and what's practical to do based on your resources or what you know and all that so i mean the whole idea of the of the pogo stick was to do a simplification obviously it didn't look like a human i think a technical scientist could appreciate that we were capturing some of the things that are important in human locomotion without it looking like it without having a knee and ankle i'll tell you the first sketch that ben brown made when we were talking about building this thing was a very complicated thing with zillions of springs lots of joints it looked like much more like a kangaroo or an ostrich or something like that things we were paying a lot of attention to at the time you know so my job was to say okay well let's do something simpler to get started and maybe we'll get there at some point i just love the idea that you you you two were studying kangaroos and ostriches oh yeah we we did we've filmed and and digitized data from horses i i did a dissection of a ostrich at one point which has absolutely remarkable legs dumb question do ostrich have like musk a lot of musculature on the legs or no most of it's up in the feathers but there's a huge amount going on in the feathers including a knee joint the knee joint's way up there the thing that's halfway down the leg that looks like a backwards knee is actually the ankle the thing on the ground which looks like the foot is actually the toes it's an extended toe fascinating but the basic morphology is the same in all these animals what do you think is the most beautiful movement of an animal like what animal do you think is the coolest land animal that's cool because fish is pretty cool like the way we traverse the water but like legged locomotion you know the slow mo's of cheetahs running are are incredible you know they're there's so much back motion and grace and of course they're moving very fast the animals running away from the cheetah are pretty exciting the pronghorn which they do this all four legs at once jump called a prong to confuse the especially if there's a group of them to confuse whoever's chasing them type of thing yep they do a misdirection thing the front on views of the cheetahs running fast where the tail is whipping around to help in the turns to help us stabilize in the turns that's that's pretty exciting because they spend a lot of time in the air i guess as they're running that fast but they also turn very fast is that a tail thing or is that do do you have to have contact with the ground everything in the body is probably helping turn because they're chasing something that's trying to get away that's also zigzagging around but i would be remiss if i didn't say you know humans are pretty right pretty good too you know you watch gymnasts especially these days they're doing just incredible stuff well like especially like olympic level gymnasts see but there could be i think there could be cheetahs that are olympic level we might be watching the average cheetah versus like that could be like a really special cheetah that can do like you're right when do the knees first come into play in in you building legged robots and big dog big dog yeah big dog came first and then little dog was later and you know there is a there's a big compromise there human knees have multiple muscles and you could argue that there's i mean it's a technical thing about negative work when you're contracting a joint but you're pushing out that's negative work mhmm and if you don't have a place to store that it can be very expensive to do negative work and the most of and in bigdog there was no place to store negative work in the knees but big dog also had pogo stick springs down below so part of the action was to comply in a bouncing motion later on in spot we took that out as we got further and further away from the leg lab we had more you know energy driven controls is there something to be said about like knees that go forward versus backward sure there's this idea called the passive dynamics which says that although although you can use computers and actuators to make motion a mechanical system can make motion just by itself if it gets stimulated the right way so tad magear i think in the mid eighties maybe it was in the late eighties started to work on that and he made this legged system that could walk down an inclined plane where the legs folded and unfolded and swung forward you know through the whole walking motion where the only thing there was no computer there were some adjustments to the mechanics so that there were dampers and springs in some places that helped the the mechanical action happen it was essentially a mechanical computer and the idea the interesting idea there is that it's not all about the brain telling dictating to the body what the body should do the body is a participant in the motion so a a great design for a robot has a mechanical component where the movement is efficient even without a brain yes how do you design that i think that these days most robots aren't doing that most robots are are basically using the computer to to govern the motion now the the brain though is taking into account what the mechanical thing can do and how it's gonna behave otherwise it would have to really forcefully move everything around all the time which probably some solutions do but i think you end up with a more efficient and more graceful thing if you're taking into account what the what the machine wants to do so this might be a good place to mention that you're now leading up the the boston dynamics ai institute newly formed which is focused more on designing the robots of the future and i think one of the things maybe you can tell me the big vision for what's going on with one of the things is this idea that hardware still matters with with organic design and so on maybe before that can you zoom out and tell me what the vision is for the ai institute you know i like to talk about intelligence having two parts an athletic part and a cognitive part mhmm and i think you know boston dynamics in my view has sort of set the standard for what athletic intelligence can be it has to do with all the things we've been talking about the mechanical design the real time control the energetics and that kind of stuff but obviously people have another kind of intelligence and and animals have another kind of intelligence you know we can make a plan our meeting started at at nine thirty i looked up on google maps how long it took to walk over here it was you know twenty minutes so i decided okay i'd leave my house at nine which is what i did mhmm you know simple intelligence but we use that kind of stuff all the time it's sort of what we think of as going on in our heads and i think that's in short supply for robots most robots are pretty dumb and as a result it takes a lot of skilled people to program them to do everything they do and it takes a long time and if robots are gonna you know satisfy our dreams they need to be smarter so the in ai institute is designed to combine that physicality of the athletic side with the cognitive side so for instance we're trying to make robots that can watch a human do a task understand what it's seeing and then do the task itself so sort of ojt for ro on the job training for robots mhmm as a paradigm now you know that's pretty hard and it's it's sort of science fiction but our idea is to work on a longer time frame and and work on solving those kinds of problems and i have a whole list of things that are kind of like in that in that vein maybe we can just take many of the things you mentioned just take it as a tangent okay first of all athletic intelligence is a super cool term and that's that really is intelligence we humans kind of take it for granted that we're so good at walking and moving about the world and using our hands you know the mechanics of interacting with all you know these parts these two things yeah you know and you've never touched those things before right well i've touched ones like this this look at all the things i can do right i can juggle them i'm rotating it this way i can rotate it without looking mhmm i could fetch these things out of my pocket and figure out which one was which and all that kind of stuff yeah and i don't think we have much of a clue how all that works yet right and that's i really like putting that under the banner of athletic intelligence what are the big open problems in athletic intelligence so boston dynamics with spot with atlas just have shown time and time again like push the limits of what we think is possible with robots but where do we stand actually if we kinda zoom out what are the big open problems on the athletic intelligence side i mean one question you could ask isn't my question but are they commercially viable will they increase productivity and i think you know we're getting very close to that mhmm i don't think we're quite there still you know most of the robotics companies it's it's a it's a struggle you know it's really the lack of the cognitive side that probably is the biggest barrier at the moment even for the physically successful robots but you know your question's a good one i mean you can always do a thing that's more efficient lighter more reliable i'd say reliability you know i know that spot they've been working very hard on getting the the tail of the reliability curve up and they've made huge progress so the robots you know there there's fifteen hundred of them out there now many of them being used in practical applications day in and day out where they have to work reliably and it's very exciting that they've done that but it takes a huge effort to get that kind of reliability in the robot there's cost too you know you'd like to get the cost down spots are still pretty expensive and i don't think that they have to be but it takes you know a different kind of activity to do that mhmm now that you know i think you know that boston dynamics is owned primarily by hyundai now and i think that the skills of hyundai in making cars can be brought to bear in making robots that are less expensive and more reliable and those kinds of things so on the cognizant side for the eye institute what's what's the trade off between moonshot projects for you and maybe incremental progress that's a good question i think we're we're using the paradigm called stepping stones to moonshots i don't i don't believe and that that was in my original proposal for stepping stones to moonshots i think if you go more than a year without seeing a tangible status report of where you are which is the stepping stone and it could be a simplification right you don't necessarily have to solve all the problems of your target goal even though your target goal is gonna take several years those those stepping stone results give you feedback give motivation because usually there's some success in there that's the mantra we've been working on that's pretty much how i'd say boston dynamics has worked you know where the you make progress and show it as you go show it to yourself if not to the world what does success look like like what what are some of the milestones you're you're chasing well we've we've with watch understand do the project i mentioned before we've broken that down into getting some progress with what is meaningfully watching something mean breaking down an observation of a person doing something into the components you know segment segmenting you know you watch me do something i'm gonna pick up this thing and put it down here and stack this on it well it's not obvious if you just look at the raw data what the sequence of acts are it's it's really a creative intelligent act for you to to break that down into the pieces and understand them in a way so you could say okay what skill do i need to accomplish each of those things so we're working on you know the front end of of that kind of a problem where we observe and translate the it may be video it may be live into a description of what we think is going on and then try and map that into skills to accomplish that and we've been developing skills as well so you know we have kinda multiple stabs at the pieces of of doing that and this is usually video of humans manipulating objects with their hands kind of thing mhmm we're starting out with bicycle repair some simple bicycle repair oh no fast that seems complicated that seems really complicated it is but but there's some parts of it that aren't like putting the seat in you know into the you know you have a tube that goes inside of another tube sure there's a latch you know that's that should be within range is it possible to to observe to watch a video like this without having an explicit model of what a bicycle looks like i think it is and i think that's the kind of thing that people don't recognize let me translate it to navigation mhmm you know i think the basic paradigm for navigating a space is to get some kind of sensor that tells you where an obstacle is and what's open build a map and then go through the space but if i if we were doing on the job training where i was giving you a task i wouldn't have to say anything about the room right we came in here mhmm all we did is adjust the chair mhmm but we didn't say anything about the room and you know we could navigate it so i think there's opportunities to build that kind of navigation skill into robots and we're hoping to be able to do that so operate successfully under a lot of uncertainty like yeah and and lack of specification lack of specification i mean that's what sort of intelligence is right it's kind of dealing with a sit understanding a situation even though it wasn't explained so how how big of a role does machine learning play in all of this is this more and more learning based you know since chat gbt which is a year ago basically mhmm there's a huge interest in that and a huge optimism about it and i think that there's a lot of things that machine learn that kind of machine learning now chris there's lots of different kinds of machine learning i think there's a lot of interest and optimism about it i think the facts on the ground are that doing physical things with physical robots is a little bit different than language mhmm and the tokens you know the tokens sort of don't exist you know pixel pixel values aren't like words but i think that there's a lot that can be done there we have we have several people working on machine learning approaches i don't know if you know but we we opened an office in zurich recently mhmm and marco hutter who's one of the real leaders in reinforcement learning for robots is the the director of that office he's still halftime at eth the university there where he has an unbelievably fantastic lab and then he's halftime leading will be leading off efforts in the zurich office so we have a healthy learning component but there's part of me that still says if you look out in the world at what the most impressive performances are they're still pretty much i hate to use the word traditional but that's what everybody's calling it traditional controls like model predictive control you know the thing the the atlas performances that you've seen are mostly model predictive control they started to do some learning stuff that's really incredible i don't know if it's all been shown yet but you'll see it over time and then marco has done some great stuff and others so especially for the athletic intelligent piece the traditional approach seems to be the one that still performs the best i think we're gonna find a mating of the two and we'll have the best of both worlds and we're working on that at the institute too if i can talk to you about teams you've built an incredible team at boston dynamics before at mit and cmu at boston dynamics and now at the ai institute and you said that there's four components to a great team technical fearlessness diligence intrepidness and fun technical fun can you explain each technical fearlessness what do you mean by that sure technical fearlessness means being willing to take on a problem that you don't know how to solve mhmm and you know study it figure out an an entry point you know maybe a simplified version or a simplified solution or something learn from the stepping stone and and go back and eventually make a solution that meets your goals and i think that's really important the fearlessness comes into play because some of it has never been done before yeah and you don't know how to do it and you know there's easier stuff to do in life so you know i mean i don't know watch understand do it's a it's a mountain of a of a challenge so that's the really big challenge you're you're tackling now can we watch humans at scale and have robots by watching humans become effective actors in the world yeah i mean we have others like that i we have one called inspect diagnose fix like you know you call up the maytag repairman okay he's the one who you don't have to call but you you you know you call up the the dishwasher repair person and they come to your house and they look at your machine it's already been actually figured out that something doesn't work but they have to kind of examine it and figure out what's wrong and then fix it mhmm and i think robots should be able to do that we already boston dynamics already has spot robots collecting data on machines things like thermal data reading the gauges listening to them getting sounds and that data are used to determine whether they're healthy or not mhmm but the interpretation isn't done by the robots yet and the certainly the fixing the diagnosing and the fixing isn't done yet but i think it could be that's bringing the ai and combining it with the physical skills to do it yeah and you're referring to the fixing in the physical world i can't wait until they can fix the psychological problems of humans and show up and just talk do therapy yeah that's a that's a different thing yeah it's a different well right it's all part of the same thing again humanity maybe maybe you mean convincing you it's okay that the dishwasher's broken just to the finish oh yeah the marketing approach yeah exactly it's all yeah don't sweat don't don't sweat the small stuff yeah as opposed to fixing the dishwasher it'll convince you that it's okay that the dishwasher is broken it's a different approach diligence why is diligence important well if you want a real robot solution it can't be a very narrow solution that's gonna break at the first variation in what the robot does or the environment if it wasn't exactly as you expected it so how do you get there i think having an approach that leaves you unsatisfied until you've embraced the bigger problem is the is the diligence i'm talking about and again i'll point at boss dynamics i think they've done a you know some of the videos that we had showing the engineer making it hard for the robot to do its task spot opening a door and then the guy gets there and pushes on the door so it doesn't open the way it's supposed to pulling on the on the rope that's attached to the robot so its navigation has been screwed up we have one where the robot's climbing stairs and engineer is tugging on a rope that's pulling it back down the stairs you know that's totally different than just the robot seeing the stairs making a model putting its feet carefully on each step but that's what probably robotics needs to succeed and having that broader that broader idea that you wanna come up with a robust solution is what i meant by diligence so really testing it in all conditions perturbing the system in all kinds of ways right and as a result creating some epic videos the the legendary the fun part the hockey stick and then yes tugging on spot as it's trying to open the door i mean the it's it's great testing but it's also i don't know it's just somehow extremely compelling demonstration of robotics in video form i learned something very early on with the first three-dimensional hopping machine if you just show a video of it hopping it's a so what if you show it falling over a couple of times and you can see how easily and fast it falls over then you appreciate what the robot's doing when it's when it's doing its thing so i think you know the reaction you just gave to the robot getting kind of interfered with or tested while it's going through the door it's showing you the scope of the solution the the limits of the system the the challenges involved in failure if this it's showing both failure and success makes you appreciate the the success yeah and then just the way the videos are done in both dynamics are incredible because they're not there's no flash there's no extra like production it's just raw testing of the robot well you know i was the final edit for most of the videos up until until about three years ago or four years ago and you know my theory of the video is no no explanation if they can't see it then it's not the right thing and if you do something worth showing then let them see it don't don't interfere with you know a bunch of titles that slow you down or a bunch of distraction just you know do something worth showing and then show it that's brilliant it's it's hard it's hard though for for people to buy into that yeah i mean people always wanna add more stuff but the simplicity of just do something worth showing and show it that's brilliant and don't add extra stuff people people have criticized especially the the big dog videos where there's a human driving the robot and and i understand the criticism now at the time we wanted to just show look this thing is using its legs to get up the hill so we focused on showing that which was we thought the story mhmm the fact that there was a human so they were thinking about autonomy whereas we were thinking about the mobility and so you know we've we've adjusted to a lot of things that we see that people care about mhmm trying to be honest we've always tried to be honest but also just show cool stuff in its raw form the limits of the system the see the system be perturbed and be robust and resilient and all that kind of stuff and and dancing with some music intrepidness and fun so intrepid i mean it might be the most important ingredient and that is you know robotics is hard it's not gonna work right right away so don't be discouraged is all it really means so usually when i talk about these things i show videos and i show a long string of outtakes you have to have courage to be intrepid when you know you work so hard you build your machine you know and then you're trying and it just doesn't do what you thought it would do what you want it to do and you know you have to stick to it and keep trying how long i mean we don't often see that the story behind spot and atlas how long how many failures was there along the way to get you know a working atlas a working spot in the early days even working big dog there's a video of atlas climbing three big steps and it's very dynamic and it's you know it's really exciting real hundred and nine tries and we have video of every one of them you know we shoot everything again we this is at boston dynamics so it took one hundred and nine tries but once it did it it had a high percentage of success so it's not like we're cheating by just showing the best one but we do show the evolved you know performance not everything along the way but the everything along the way is informative and you know it shows sort of there's you know stupid things that go wrong like like the robot just when you say go and it collapses right there on the start that doesn't have to do with the steps or the perception didn't work right so you miss the target when you jump or something breaks and there's oil flying everywhere but that's fun yeah so the hardware failures and and maybe some softness lots of control of evolution during that time i think it took six weeks to get that those hundred and nine trials you know because there was there was programming going on you know it was it was actually robot learning but there were human in the loop helping with the learning so all data driven but okay and so and you always are learning from that failure so right and how do you how do you protect atlas from not getting damaged from a hundred and nine attempts it was re it's remarkable one of the accomplishments of atlas is that the engineers have made a machine that's robust enough that it can take that kind of testing where it's falling and stuff and it doesn't break every time it still breaks and we had you know part of the paradigm is to have people to repair stuff you gotta figure that in if you're gonna do this kind of work you know i sometimes criticize the people who have their gold plated thing and they keep it on the shelf and everybody and they're afraid to kinda use it i don't think you can make progress if you're working that way you you need to be ready to have it break and and go in there and fix it it's part of the thing you know plan your budget so you have spare parts and accrue and all that stuff yeah if it falls a hundred and nine times it's okay wow so intrepid truly and that applies to spot that applies to all the other ones to everything i think it applies to everything anybody tries to do that's worth doing yeah and especially with systems in the real world right yeah and so fun fun technical fun i usually say have technical fun i think that life as an engineer is really satisfying mhmm i think you get to you know to some degree it it can be like crafts work where you get to do things with your own hands or your own design or whatever your you know your media is and it's very satisfying to be able to just do the work unlike a lot of people who have to do something that they don't like doing i think engineers typically get to do something that they like and there's a lot of satisfaction from that then there's you know in many cases you can have impact on the world somehow because you've done something that other people admire which is different from the own just the craft fun of of building a thing so that's the second way that that being engineer is good i think the third thing is that if you're lucky to be working in a team where you're getting the benefit of other people's skills that are helping you do your thing you know none of us has all the skills needed to do most of these projects and if you have a team where you're working well with the others that can be very satisfying and then if you're an engineer you also usually get paid and so you you kinda get paid four times yeah in my view of the world yeah so what could be better than that get paid to have fun i mean what what do you love about engineering what when you say engineering what does that what does that mean to you exactly what is this kinda big thing that we call engineering i think it's both being a scientist or getting to use science at the same time as being kind of an artist or a creator because you're making some you know scientists only get to describe to to study what's out there and engineers get get to make stuff that didn't exist before mhmm and so it's really i think a higher calling even though i think most you know the public out there think science is top and engineering is somehow secondary but i think it's the other way around and at the cutting edge i think when you when you talk about robotics there is a possibility to do art in that you do like the first of its kind thing so then there's the production at scale which is its own beautiful thing but when you do the first new robot or the first new thing that's a possibility to create something totally new that is a hard bringing metal to life or a machine to life is kind of is fun and you know it was fun doing the dancing videos where got a huge you know public response and we're gonna do more we're gonna do some we're doing some at the institute and we'll we'll do more with that metal to life moment i mean to me that's still magical like when when inanimate objects comes to life that's still like to me it's to this day it's still an incredible moment the human intelligence can create systems that instill life or whatever that is in into an inanimate objects it's it's it's really it's truly magical especially when it's at the scale of mhmm that humans can perceive mhmm and appreciate like directly but i think sort of with it going going back to the pieces of that you know you design a linkage that turns out to be half the weight and just as strong that's that's very satisfying and you know there are people who do that and it's it's a creative creative act what what to you is most beautiful about robotics sorry for the big romantic question i think having the robots move in a way that's evocative of life is pretty exciting so the elegance of movement yeah or if it's a high performance act where it's doing it faster bigger than than other robots usually we're not doing it bigger faster than people but we're getting there in a few narrow dimensions so faster bigger smoother more elegant more graceful i mean i'd like to do dancing that that starts you know we're nowhere near the the dancing capabilities of a human we we've been having a ballerina in who's kind of a well known ballerina and she's been programming the robot we've been working on the tools that can make it so that she can use her way of talking you know way of doing a choreography or something like that more accessible to to get the robot to do things and it's starting to produce some interesting stuff well we should mention that there is a choreography tool there is i i mean i i guess i saw versions of it which is pretty cool you can kinda at at slices of time uh-huh control different parts at the high level the movement of the robot and spot we hope to take that forward and make it you know more tuned to how the dance world wants to talk wants to communicate and and get better performances i mean we've done done a lot but there's still a lot possible and i'd like to have performances where the robots are dancing with people so right now almost everything that we've done on dancing is to a fixed time base so once you press go the robot does its thing and plays out its thing it's not listening it's not watching mhmm but i think it should do those things i think i would love to see a professional ballerina like alone in a room with a robot slowly teaching the robot just actually the the process of a clueless robot trying to figure out a small little piece of a dance so it's not like because right now atlas and spot have done like perfect dancing right to a beat and so on one so you know to a degree but the learning process of interacting with a human would be incredible to watch one of the cool things going on you know that there's a class at brown university called choreo robotics sydney skybetter mhmm is a dancer choreographer and he he teamed up with stephanie tellax who's a computer science professor mhmm and they taught this class and i think they have some graduate students help and teach it where they have two spots and people come in i think it's fifty fifty of computer science people and dance people mhmm they program performances that are very interesting i show some of them sometimes when i give a talk making that process of a human teaching the robot more efficient more intuitive maybe part language part movement that'd be fascinating that'd be really fascinating because i mean one one of the things i've kinda realized is humans communicate with movement a lot it's not just language there's a lot there's body language there's so many intricate little things and totally and like that you know to to watch a human and spot communicate back and forth with movement is i mean there's just so many wonderful possibilities there yeah but it's also a challenge you know we we get asked to have our robots perform with with famous dancers mhmm and they can you know they have two hundred degrees of freedom or something right every little ripple and thing and they have all this head and neck and shoulders and stuff and the robots mostly don't have all that stuff and it's a daunting challenge to not look stupid mhmm you know physically stupid next to them yeah and so we've we've pretty much avoided that kind of performance but we'll we'll get to it i think even with the limited degrees of freedom we could still have some sass and flavor and so on you can figure out your own thing even if you can't and we can reverse things like if you watch a human do robot animation which is a dance style mhmm where you know you jerk around mhmm sort of and you pop you pop and pop and lock and all that stuff i think the robots could show up the day the humans by you know doing unstable oscillations and things that are faster than a person could so that's sort of on my you know my plan but we haven't quite gotten there yet you you mentioned about building teams and robotics teams and so on how do you how do you find great engineers how do you hire great engineers i think you even need to have an environment where interesting engineer well you know it's a chicken and egg if you have an environment where interesting engineering is going on then engineers wanna work there and you know i think it took a long time to develop that at boston dynamics in fact when we started although you know i had the experience of building things in the in the my in the leg lab both at cmu and at mit we weren't that sophisticated of an engineering thing compared to what boston dynamics is now but it was our ambition to do that and you know sarcos was another robot company so i always thought of us as being this much on the computing side and this much on the hardware side mhmm and they were like this mhmm and then over the years we you know i think we achieved the same or better levels of engineering meanwhile you know sarcos got acquired and then they went through all kinds of changes and i don't know exactly what their current status is but so it took it took many years is is part of the answer mhmm i think you get you gotta find people who love it in the early days we would we paid a little less so we only got people who were doing it because because they really loved it we also hired people who might not have professional degrees people who were building bicycles and building kayaks we have some people who come from that kind of the maker world that's really important for the kind of work we do to have that be part of the mix whatever that is whatever the magic ingredient that makes a great builder maker that's the big part of it people who repaired the car the cars or motorcycles or whatever in their garages when they were kids there's a kinda like the robotics students grad students and just roboticists that i know and i hang out with there's a kinda endless energy and like they're just they're just happy like say i compare it another group of people that are like that are people that skydive professionally there's just like excitement and general energy that i think probably has to do with the fact that they're just constantly first of all fail a lot and then the the joy of building a thing that you eventually works yeah tell me about being happy there used to be a time when when i was doing the machine shop work myself back in those jpl and caltech days when if i came home smelling like the machine shop you know because it's an oily place my wife would say oh you you had a good day tonight heather because she could tell that that's where i'd been you've done you've yeah you've you've actually built something you've done something in the physical world yeah and probably the videos help right the videos help show off what robotics is oh you know at boston dynamics it put us on the map we i remember interviewing some sales guy mhmm and he was from a company and he said well no one's ever heard of my company but we have products you know really good products you guys everybody knows who you are but you don't have any any products at all which was true so it was and you know we thank youtube for that youtube came we caught the youtube wave and it had a huge impact on on our company i mean that's that's it's a big impact not just on your company but on robotics in general and helping people understand and inspire what is possible yeah with robots yeah they inspire imagination fear and everything all the the full spectrum of human emotion was was aroused which is yeah which is great which is is great for the entirety of humanity and and also it's probably inspiring for young people that wanna get into ai and robotics yeah let me ask you about some competitors sure you've been complimentary of elon and tesla's work on optimus robot with this their humanoid robot what do you think of their efforts there with the humanoid robot you know i really admire elon as a technologist i think that what he did with tesla it was just totally mind boggling that he could go from this totally niche area that you know less than one percent of anybody seemed to be interested to making it so that essentially every car company in the world is trying to do what what he's done so you gotta give it to him then look at spacex you know he's basically replaced nasa if you could that might be a little exaggeration but not by much mhmm so you know you gotta admire the guy and you know i wouldn't count him out for for anything you know i don't think optimus today is is where atlas is for instance i don't know it's a little hard to compare them to the other companies you know i i i visited figur i think they're doing well and they have a good team i've visited apptronic and i think they're they have a good team and they're doing well but elon has a lot of resources he has a lot of ambition i'd like to take some credit for his ambition i think i think if i read between the lines it's hard not to think that him seeing what atlas is doing is a little bit of an inspiration i i hope so mhmm do you think atlas and optimus will will hang out at some point i would love to host that you know yeah now that i'm not at boston dynamics you know i'm not officially connected i am on the board but i'm not officially connected i would love to host a robot meetups a robot meetup yeah does the ai institute work with spots and atlas is it focused on spots mostly right now as a platform we have a bunch of different robots we bought everything we could buy so we have spots i think we have a good sized fleet in them i don't know how many it is but a good sized fleet we have a couple of animal robots mhmm you know animal is a company founded by marco hutter even though he's not that involved anymore but we have a couple of those we have a bunch of arms like you know frank is in us robotics because you know even though we have ambitions to build stuff and we are build starting to build stuff you know day one getting off the ground we just you know just bought stuff and i love this like robot playground you've built yeah you can come over and take a look at you that's great so it's like all these kinds of robots legged arms it doesn't feel that much like well there's some areas that feel like a playground but it's not like they're all frolicking together hey again maybe you'll arrange it a robot meetup but in general what's your view on competition in this space for especially humanoid and lego robots are you excited by the competition or the friendly competition i think that it it doesn't you know i don't think i don't think about competition that much you know i'm not a commercial guy i think for many years at boston you know the many years i was at boston dynamics we did we didn't think about competition we were just kinda doing our thing there wasn't it wasn't like there were products out there that we were competing with no you know maybe there was some competition for darpa funding which we got you know got a lot of got very good at at getting but even there in in a couple of cases where we might have competed we ended up just being the robot provider that is for the little dog program you know we we just made the robots we didn't participate as developers except for developing the robot and in the darpa robotics challenge we didn't compete we provided the robots so you know in the ai world now now that we're working on cognitive stuff it feels much more like a a competition you know the the entry requirements in terms of computing hardware and the skills of the team are and hiring talent it's a much tougher place so i think much more about competition now on the cognitive side on the physical side it doesn't feel like it's that much about competition yet obviously with ten humanoid companies out there ten or twelve i mean there's probably others that i don't know about they're definitely in competition will be in competition how much room is there for quadruped and especially humanoid robot to become cheaper so like cutting cost and like how low can you go and how much of it is just mass production so questions of you know hyundai like how to produce versus like engineering innovation how to simplify i think there's a huge way to go i don't think we've seen the bottom of it or the bottom in terms of lower prices you know i think you should be totally optimistic that at asymptote things don't have to be anything like as expensive as they are now back to competition i wanted to say one thing i think in the quadruped space having other people selling quadrupeds is a great thing for boston dynamics because the question i believe the question in the user's minds is which quadruped do i want it's not oh can a quadra do i want a quadruped can a quadruped do my job it's much more like that which is a a great place for it to be yeah then you're just doing the things you normally do to make your product better and compete and selling and all that stuff and that'll be the way it is with humanoids at some point well there's a lot of humanoids and you're just not even it's like iphone versus android and people are just buying both and it's kinda just yeah you you're not really you're creating the category yeah you know or the category is happening i mean right now the use cases you know that that's the the key thing having realistic use cases that are money making in robotics is is a big challenge you know there's the warehouse use case that's probably the only thing that makes anybody any money in robotics at this point there's gotta be a moment there's old fashioned robotics i mean there aren't fixed arms doing manufacturing i don't wanna yes say that they're not making money industrial robotics yes but i i there's gotta be a moment when social robotics starts making real money meaning like a spa type robot in the home and there's tens of millions of them in the home and they're like you know i don't know how many dogs there are in the united states as pets but this feels many it feels like there's something we love about having a intelligent companion with us that remembers us that's excited to see us all that kind of stuff but it's also true that the companies making those things there have been a lot of failures in recent times right there's that one year when i think three of them went under yeah so it's it's not that easy to do that right getting you know getting performance safety and cost all to be where they need to be at the same time is that's that's hard but also some of it is like you said you can have a product but people might not be aware of it so like also part of it is the videos or however you connect with the public the the culture and like create the category that may may people realize this is the thing you want because from a you know there's a lot of negative perceptions you can have do you really want a system with a camera in your home walking around right if if it's presented correctly and if there's like the right kind of boundaries around it that you understand how it works and so on that a lot of people would want to and if they don't they might be suspicious of it so that that's an important one like we we all use smartphones and it has a camera that's looking at us yeah it has two or three or four and it's listening very few people are you know suspicious about it they kinda take it for granted and so on i think robots would be the same kind of way i i agree so as you work on the cognitive aspect of of these robots do you think we'll ever get to human level or superhuman level intelligence there's there's been a lot of conversations about this recently given the rapid development in large language models i think that intelligence is a lot of different things and i think some things computers are already smarter than people and some things they're not even close and you know i think you need a menu of of detailed categories to come up with with that but i also think that the you know the the con the conversation that seems to be happening about agi is puzzles me it's sort of so i ask you a question do you think there's anybody smarter than you in the world absolutely yes does do you find that threatening no so i don't understand even if computers were smarter than people why we should assume that that's a threat especially since they could easily be smarter but still available to us or under our control which is basically how computers generally are i think the the fear is that they would be ten x a hundred x smarter and operating under different morals and ethical codes than humans like naturally do and so almost become misaligned in unintended ways and therefore harm humans in ways which we just can't predict and even if we program them to do a thing as on the way of doing that thing they would cause a lot of harm and when they're a hundred times a thousand times ten thousand times smarter than us we won't be able to stop it or won't be able to even see the harm as it's happening until it's too late that kind of stuff so you can construct all kinds of like possible trajectories of how the world ends because of superintelligent systems it's a little bit like that line in the oppenheimer movie where they contemplate whether the first time they set off a reaction all matter on earth is gonna you know go go up i don't remember what the the verb they used was for for it the chain reaction right mhmm yeah i guess it's possible but i don't i don't think i personally don't think it's worth worrying about that i think that the you know it's an opportunity balancing opportunities and risk mhmm i think if you take any technology there's opportunity and risk and it's easy to point i'll point at the car they pollute and they about what one point two five million people get killed every year around the world because of them despite that i think they're a boon to humankind very useful many of us love them and those technical problems can be solved i think they are becoming safer i think they're becoming less polluting at least some of them are and every technology you can name has a story like that in my opinion what's the story behind behind the hawaiian shirt is it a fashion statement philosophical statement is it just a statement of rebellion engineering statement it was born of me being a contrarian yes someone it's just a symbol someone told me once that i was wearing one when i only had one or two and they said oh those things are so old fashioned you can't wear that mark and i stopped wearing them for about a week yeah and then i said i'm not gonna let them tell me yeah what to do and so every day since pretty much so it's like a that was years ago that was twenty years ago fifteen fifteen years ago probably that says something about your personality that's great because you're not yeah it took me a while to realize i was a contrarian but you know it can be a useful tool mhmm have have you had people tell you about on the robotics side that like i don't think you could do this that kind of negative motivation i'd rather talk about there's a guy when we were doing a lot of darpa work there was a marine ed tovar who's still around who his his what he would always say is when someone would say oh you can't do that he'd say why not yeah and it's a great question i ask all the time when i'm thinking oh that's gonna we're not gonna do that and i say why not and i give him credit for opening my eyes to to to resisting that so yeah yeah the hawaiian shirt is almost like a symbol of why not okay what advice would you give to young folks that are trying to figure out what they wanna do with their life how to have a life they can be proud of how they can have a career they can be proud of when i was teaching at mit i for a while i had undergraduate advisees where you know people would have to meet with me once a semester or something mhmm and they frequently would ask you know what they should do and i think the advice i used to give was something like well if you had no constraints on you no resource constraints no opportunity constraints and no still skill constraints what would you could you imagine doing and i said well start there mhmm and see how close you can get you know what's realistic yeah for how close you can get you know the other version of that is you know try and figure out what you wanna do and and do that because i don't i don't think a lot of people think that they're in a channel right and there's only limited opportunities but it's usually wider than they think yeah the opportunities really are limitless but at the same time you want to pick a thing right and it's the the the diligence yeah and really really pursue it right like really pursue it yeah because because sometimes like the really special stuff happens after years of pursuit yeah oh absolutely it can take it can take a while i mean you've been doing this for forty plus years people some people think i'm in iraq right why don't i do and in fact some of the inspiration for the ai institute is to say okay i've been working on locomotion for however many years it was let's do something else mhmm and it's it's a really fascinating and interesting challenge and you you're hoping to show it off also in the same way as just about to start showing some stuff off yeah i hope we have youtube channel i mean one of the challenges is it's one thing to show athletic skills on youtube mhmm showing cognitive function is a lot harder and i haven't quite figured out yet how that's gonna work there might be a way there's a way there's a way why not i also do think sucking at a task is also compelling like the incremental improvement a robot being like really terrible at a task and then slowly becoming better even in athletic intelligence honestly like learning to walk and falling and slowly figuring that out i think there's something extremely compelling about that you're right we we like flaws especially with the cognitive task it's okay to be clumsy it's okay to be confused and a little silly and all that kind of stuff it it feels like in that space is where we can there's charm there's charm the charm the char there's charm and there's something inspiring about a robot sucking and then becoming less terrible slowly at a task no i think you're right that kinda reveals something about us about ourselves and ultimately that's what's one of the coolest things about robots is it's kind of a mirror about what makes humans special just by watching how hard it is to make a robot do the things that humans do you realize how special we are mhmm what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing why are we here mark you you ever ask about the big questions as you try to create these humanoid human like intelligent systems i don't know i think you have to have fun while you're here that's about all i know it would be a waste life it would be a waste not to right the ride is pretty short so might as well have fun mark i'm a huge fan of yours it's a huge honor that you would talk with me this is really amazing and your work for many decades has been amazing i can't wait to see what you do at the ai institute i'm gonna be waiting impatiently for the videos and the demos and the and the next robot meetup for maybe atlas and optimus to hang out i would love to do that that would be fun thank you so much for talking to me thank you it was fun talking to you thanks for listening to this conversation with mark reibert to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from arthur c clark whether we're based on carbon or on silicon makes no fundamental difference we should each be treated with appropriate respect thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
