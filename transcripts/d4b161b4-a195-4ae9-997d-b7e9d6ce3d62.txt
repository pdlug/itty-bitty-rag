the following is a conversation with jeff bezos founder of amazon and blue origin this is his first time doing a conversation of this kind and of this length and as he told me it felt like we could have easily talked for many more hours and i'm sure we will and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this podcast we got notion for team collaboration policygenius for insurance masterclass for learning a sleep for naps and insight tracker for biological data choose wisely my friends also if you want to work with our amazing

with the aliens but in this case it's with me and now onto the full ad reads there's always no ads in the middle i try to make this interesting but if you must skip them friends please still check out our sponsors i enjoy their stuff maybe you will too this show is brought to you by notion a note taking app that i've been using forever but it's not just for note taking it's also for team collaboration and it's been doing that forever but recently it also has the extra added ai capabilities with the notion ai tool obviously everybody's trying to figure out how to integrate the progress with llms the continued progress the accelerating progress the boundless progress with llms into our productive lives to me obviously the note taking the putting words onto paper as part of the process of figuring out intellectual puzzles of thinking through things designing things summarizing things interpreting things all of that that's the writing process and integrating ai into that to help you almost like a buddy is obviously empowering but there's an interface question how to do that well and to me notion does that better than any tool i've used so far notion ai can now give you

com slash lex to try the power of notion ai today this show is also brought to you by policygenius a marketplace for finding and buying life insurance almost every single conversation i have in different ways i ponder i explore i deliberate the simple fact of our mortality the finiteness of every experience the human experience but every experience that makes up the human experience the good and the bad i think bringing that up as a topic is important because it is one of the big questions for the introspecting animal that is a human being for somebody who's trying to figure out the puzzle of the human condition why does it have to end is it good that it has to end how does the fact of it ending play with the richness of the experience of every moment that we feel when we open our eyes to the beauty of that experience those are good questions but they also put you in the right mindset to explore the other questions the details of engineering the details of business and science all of that are somehow made more visceral more intensely salient when grounded in the context of pondering one's own mortality that's why i tried to do it and i guess policy genius wants you to ponder your mortality and do something about it a pragmatic angle with policygenius you can find life insurance policies that start at just two hundred ninety two bucks a year for one million

childhood with your grandfather on a ranch here in texas mhmm and i heard you had a a lot of work to do around the ranch so what's the coolest job you remember doing there wow coolest most interesting but most memorable most memorable most important a it was real it's a real working ranch my and i i spent all my summers on that ranch from age four to sixteen and my grandfather was really taking me those in the summers in the in the early summers he was letting me pretend to help on the ranch because of course a four year old is a burden not to help in real life he's really just watching me and taking care of me and he was doing that because my mom was so young she had me when she was seventeen and so he was sort of giving her a break and my grandmother and my grandfather would take me for these summers but as i got a little older i actually was helpful on the ranch and i loved it i was out there like my grandfather had a huge influence on me huge factor in my life i did all the jobs you would do on a ranch i've fixed windmills and laid fences and pipelines and you know done all the things that any rancher would do vaccinated the animals everything but we had a you know my grandfather after my grandmother died i was about twelve and i kept coming to the ranch so it was then it was just him and me just the two of us and he was completely addicted to the soap opera the days of our lives mhmm and we would go back to the ranch house every day around one pm or so to watch days of our lives like sands through an hourglass so are the days of our lives just the image of that the two of us sitting there watching a slowpawper he had these big crazy dogs it was really a very formative experience for me but the key thing about it for me the the the great gift i got from it was that my grandfather was so resourceful you know he did everything himself he made his own veterinary tools he would make needles to suture the cattle up with like he would find a little piece of wire and heat it up and pound it thin and drill a hole in it and sharpen it so you know you learn different things on a ranch than you would learn you know growing up in a city so self reliance yeah like figuring out that you can solve problems with enough persistence and ingenuity and my grandfather bought a d six bulldozer which is a big bulldozer and he got it for like five thousand dollars because it was completely broken down it was like a nineteen fifty five caterpillar d six bulldozer knew it would have cost i don't know more than a hundred thousand dollars and we spent an entire summer fixing like preparing that bulldozer and we'd you know use mail order to to buy big gears for the transmission and they'd show up they'd be too heavy to move so we'd have to build a crane you know just that kind of kind of that problem solving mentality he had it so powerfully you know he he did all of his own he just he he didn't pick up the phone and call somebody he would figure it out on his own he doing his own veterinary work you know but just the image of the two of you fixing a d six bulldozer and then going in for a little break at one pm to watch soap opera laying on the floor that's how he watched tv yeah he was a really really remarkable guy that's how i imagine clint eastwood also you know all those westerns when he's when he's not doing what he's doing he's just watching soap operas alright i read that you fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration when you were five watching neil armstrong walking on the moon so let me ask you to look back at the historical context and impact of that so the space race from nineteen fifty seven to nineteen sixty nine between the soviet union and the us was in many ways epic it was a rapid sequence of dramatic events first satellite to space first human to space for a spacewalk first uncouth landing on the moon then some failures explosions deaths on both sides actually and then the first human walking on the moon what are some of the more inspiring moments or insights you take away from that time those few years at just twelve years well i mean there's so much inspiring there you know one of the great things to take away from that one of the great von braun quotes is i have i have come to use the word impossible with great caution yeah yeah yeah and so that's kind of the big story of apollo is that things you know the going to the moon was literally an analogy that people used for something that's impossible you know oh yeah you'll do that when when you know men walk on the moon yeah and of course it finally happened so you know i think it was pulled forward in time because of the space race i think you know with the geopolitical implications and you know how much resource was put into it you know at the peak that program was spending you know two or three percent of gdp on the apollo program so much resource that i think it was pulled forward in time you know we kind of did it ahead of when we quote unquote should have done it yeah and so in that way it's also a tactical marvel i mean it's truly incredible it's you know it's the twentieth century version of building the pyramids or something it's you know it's an achievement that because it was pulled forward in time and because it did something that had previously thought impossible it rightly deserves its place as you know in the pantheon of great human achievements and of course you named the projects the rockets that blue origin is working on after some of the folks involved yeah i don't understand why it didn't say new gagarin i'd is that there's an american bias in the naming i apologize this is very strange alexa just asking for a friend clarify i'm a big fan of gagarin's though in fact i i think his his first words in space i think are incredible he you know he purportedly said my god it's blue and that really drives home no one had seen the earth from space no one knew that we were on this blue planet yeah no one knew what it looked like from out there and gagarin was the first person to see it one of the things i think about is how dangerous those early days were for gagarin for for glenn for everybody involved like how how big of a risk they're all they were taking huge risks i'm not sure what the soviets thought about gagarin's flight but i think that the americans thought that the alan shepard flight the flight that you know new shepard is named after the first american in space he'd been on his suborbital flight they thought he had about a seventy five percent chance of success mhmm so you know that's a pretty big risk a twenty five percent risk it's it's kinda interesting that alan shepard is not quite as famous as john glenn so for people who don't know alan shepard is the first astronaut the first american in space american in suborbital flight correct and and then the first orbital flight is that john glenn is the first american to orbit the earth by the way i have the most charming sweet incredible letter from john glenn which i have framed and hang on my office wall what did you say where he tells me how grateful he is that we have named new glenn after him and they sent me that letter about a week before he died and it's really an incredible it's also a very funny letter he's writing and he says you know this is a letter about new glenn from the original glenn and he says he's got a great sense of humor and he's very he's very happy about it and grateful it's very sweet does he say ps don't mess this up or is that no he doesn't make me look good he doesn't do that but but we but john wherever you are we got you covered good so so back to maybe the big picture of space when you look up at the stars and think big what do you hope is the future of humanity hundreds thousands of years from now out in space i would love to see you know a a you know a trillion humans living in the solar system if we had a trillion humans we would have at any given time a thousand mozarts and a thousand einsteins that would you know our solar system would be full of life and intelligence and energy and we can easily support a civilization that large with all of the resources in the solar system so what what do you think that looks like giant space stations yeah the only way to get to that vision is with giant space stations you know the planetary surfaces are just way too small so you can i mean unless you turn them into giant space stations or something but but yeah we will take materials from the moon and from near earth objects and from the asteroid belt and so on and we'll build giant o'neil style colonies and people will live in those and they have a lot of advantages over planetary surfaces you can spin them to get normal earth gravity you can put them where you want them i think most people are gonna wanna live near earth not necessarily in earth orbit but in you know earth but near earth vicinity orbits and so they can move you know relatively quickly back and forth between their station and earth so but i think a lot of people especially in the early stages are not gonna wanna give up earth altogether they they go to earth for vacation yeah same way that you know you might go to to yellowstone national park for vacation people will and the and no one and people will get to choose whether they live on earth or whether they live in space but they'll be able to use much more energy and much more material resource in space than they would be able to use on earth one of the interesting ideas you had is to move the heavy industry away from earth so people sometimes have this idea that somehow space exploration is in conflict with the celebration of the planet earth that we should focus on preserving earth and and basically your ideas that space travel and space exploration is a way to preserve earth exactly this planet we've sent robotic probes to all the planets we know that this is the good one yeah not to play favorites or anything but the earth really is the good planet it's an it's it's amazing the ecosystem we have here all of the life and the lush the plant life and you know the water resources everything this planet is really extraordinary and of course we evolved on this planet so of course it's perfect for us but it's also perfect for all the advanced life forms on this planet all the animals and so on and so this is a gem we do need to take care of it and as we enter the anthropocene as we get as we humans have gotten so sophisticated and large and impactful as we stride across this planet you know it's that is gonna as as we continue we want to use a lot of energy we want to use a lot of energy per capita we've gotten amazing things we we don't wanna go backwards you know if you think about the good old days they're mostly an illusion like in almost every way life is better for almost everyone today than it was say fifty years ago or a hundred years we live better lives by and large than our grandparents did and their grandparents did and so on and you can see that in global illiteracy rates global poverty rates global infant mortality rates like almost any metric you choose we're better off than we used to be and we get you know antibiotics and all kinds of life saving medical care and so on and so on and there's one thing that is moving backwards and it's the natural world mhmm so it is a fact that five hundred years ago pre industrial age the natural world was pristine it was incredible and we have traded some of that pristine beauty for all of these other gifts that we have as an advanced society and we can have both but to do that we have to go to space and all of this really the most fundamental measure is energy usage per capita and when you look at you know you do wanna continue to use more and more energy it is going to make your life better in so many ways but that's not compatible ultimately with living on a finite planet and so we have to go out into the solar system and and really you could argue about when you have to do that but you can't credibly argue about whether you have to do that eventually we have to do that exactly so you don't often talk about it but let me ask you on that topic about the blue ring and the orbital reef space infrastructure projects what's your vision for these so blue ring is a very interesting spacecraft that is designed to take up to three thousand kilograms of payload up to geosynchronous orbit or in lunar vicinity it has two different kinds of propulsion it has chemical propulsion and it has electric propulsion and so it can it can be you can use blue ring in a couple different ways you can slowly move let's say up to geosynchronous orbit using electric propulsion that might take you know a hundred days or a hundred and fifty days depending on how much mass you're carrying and then and reserve your chemical propulsion so that you can change orbits quickly in geosynchronous orbit or you can use the chemical propulsion first to quickly get up to geosynchronous and then use your electrical propulsion to slowly change your geosynchronous orbit blue ring has a couple of interesting features it's a it provides a lot of services to these payloads so the payload it could be one large payload or it can be a number of small payloads and it provides thermal management it provides electric power it provides compute provides communications and so when you design a payload for blue ring you don't have it's it it you don't have to figure out all of those things on your own so kind of radiation tolerant compute is a complicated thing to do and so we have an unusually large amount of radiation tolerant compute onboard blue ring and you can your payload can just use that when it needs to so it's a it's sort of all these services it's you know it's it's like a set of apis it's a little bit like amazon web services but for for space for space payloads that need to move about in earth vicinity or lunar vicinity awss space okay so so compute in space so you get you get a giant chemical rocket to get a payload out to orbit and then you have these admins that show up this blue ring thing that manages various things like compute exactly and it can it can also provide transportation and move you around to different orbits including humans you you think no but blue ring is not designed to move humans around it's designed to move payloads around so we're also building a lunar lander which is of course designed to to land humans on the surface of the moon i wanna ask you about that well let me let me actually just step back to the old days you were at princeton with aspirations to be a theoretical physicist yeah what attracted you to physics and why did you change your mind and not become why why are you not jeff bezos the famous theoretical physicist so i loved physics and i studied physics and computer science and i was proceeding along along the physics path i was planning to major in physics and i wanted to be a theoretical physicist and i would and the computer science was sort of something i was doing for fun i really loved it and i and i was very good at the the programming and doing those things and i enjoyed all my computer science classes immensely but i really was determined to be a theoretical physicist i'd that's why i went to princeton in the first place it was definitely and then i realized i was gonna be a mediocre theoretical physicist and there were there were a few people in my classes like in quantum mechanics and so on who they could effortlessly do things that were so difficult for me and i realized like you know there are a thousand ways to be smart mhmm and to be a really you know theoretical physics is not one of those fields where the you know only the top few percent actually move the state of the art forward mhmm it's one of those things where you you have to be really just your brain has to be wired in a certain way and there was a guy named one of these people who was convinced me he didn't mean to convince me but just by observing him he convinced me that i should not try to be a theoretical physicist his name was yosanta and yosanta was from sri lanka and he's he was one of the most brilliant people i'd ever met my friend joe and i were working on a very difficult partial differential equations problem set one night and there was one problem that we worked on for three hours mhmm and we made no headway whatsoever and we looked up at each other at the same time and we said yo santa so we went to yo santa's dorm room yeah and he was there he was almost always there and we said yo santa we're having trouble solving this partial differential equation would you mind taking a look and he said of course by the way he was the most humble most kind person and so he took our he looked at our problem and he stared at it for just a few seconds maybe ten seconds and he said cosine and i said what do you mean usant what do you mean cosine he said that's the answer and i said no no no come on and he said let me show you and he took out some paper and he wrote down three pages of equations everything canceled out mhmm and the answer was cosine and i said yo santa did you do that in your head and he said no no that would be impossible a few years ago i solved a similar problem and i could map this problem onto that problem and then it was immediately obvious that the answer was cosine i had a few you know you have an experience like that you realize maybe being a theoretical physicist isn't sure isn't what you're you're you're what the universe wants you to be and so i switched to computer science and and you know that worked out really well for me i enjoy it i still enjoy it today yeah there's a particular kind of intuition you need to be a great physicist in applied to physics i think the mathematical skill required today is so high you have to be a world class mathematician to be a successful theoretical physicist today and it's not you know it you probably need other skills too intuition lateral thinking and so on but without the without just top notch math skills you're unlikely to be successful and visualization skill you have to be able to really kinda do these kind of thought experiments and if you wanted truly great creativity actually walter isaacson writes about you it puts you on the same level as einstein and well he's he's that's very kind but i have i'm an inventor if you if you wanna boil down what i am i'm really an inventor and i look at things and i can come up with atypical solutions and you know and then i can create a hundred such atypical solutions for something ninety nine of them may not survive you know scrutiny but one of those one hundred is like maybe there is maybe that might work and then you can keep going from there so that kind of lateral thinking that kind of inventiveness in a high dimensionality space where the search space is very large that's where my inventive skills come that's the thing i'm if if i i self identify as an inventor more than anything else yeah and he describes in all kinds of different ways walter isaacson does that creativity combined with childlike wander that you've maintained still to this day all of that combined together is there like if you were to study your own brain introspect how do you think what's your thinking process like we'll talk about the writing process of putting it down on paper mhmm which is quite rigorous and famous at amazon but how do you when you sit down maybe alone maybe with others and thinking through this high dimensional space and looking for creative solutions creative paths forward is there something you could say about that process it's such a good question and i honestly don't know how it works if i did i would try to explain it i know it involves lots of wandering yeah so i'd you know when i sit down to work on a problem i know i don't know where i'm going so to to go in a straight line to be efficient efficiency and invention are sort of at odds because invention real invention not incremental improvement incremental improvement is so important in in every endeavor and everything you do you have to work hard on also just making things a little bit better but i'm talking about real invention real lateral thinking that requires wandering mhmm and you have to give yourself permission to wander i think a lot of people they feel like wandering is inefficient and you know like when when i sit down at a meeting i don't know how long the meeting is gonna take if we're trying to solve a problem because if i did then i'd already i could i know there's some kind of straight line that we're drawing to the solution the reality is we may have to wander for a long time and i do like group invention i think there's really nothing more fun than sitting at a whiteboard with a a numb you know a group of smart people and spitballing and coming up with new ideas and objections to those ideas and and then solutions to the objections and going back and forth so like you know sometimes you wake up with an idea in the middle of the night and sometimes you sit down with a group of people and go back and forth and both things are really pleasurable mhmm and when you wander i think one key thing is to notice a good idea and to to to maybe to notice the kernel of a good idea or maybe pull out that string because i i don't think good ideas come fully formed a hundred percent right in fact when i come up with what i think is a good idea and it survives kind of the first level of scrutiny you know that i do in my own head and i'm ready to tell somebody else about the idea mhmm i will often say look it is gonna be really easy for you to find objections yeah to this idea but work with me there's something there there's something there and that is intuition yeah you because it's really easy to kill new ideas in the beginning because they do have so many and so many easy objections to them so you need to you need to kind of forewarn people and say look i know it's gonna take a lot of work to get this to a fully formed idea let's get started on that it'll be fun mhmm so you got that ability to say cosine in you somewhere after all maybe not on math but in a different domain yeah there are a thousand ways to be smart by the way and that is a really like when i go around you know and and i meet people i'm always looking for the way that they're smart and you find it is that's one of the things that makes the world so interesting and fun is that it is not it's not like iq is a single yep dimension there are people who are smart in so such unique ways yeah you just gave me a good response as when somebody calls me an idiot on the internet you know there's a thousand ways to be smart sir well what they they might tell you yeah but there are million to be ways to be done yeah right i feel like that's a mark twain quote okay alright you gave me an amazing tour of blue origin rocket factory and launch complex in the historic cape canaveral that's where new glenn the the big rocket we talked about is being built and will launch can you explain what the new glenn rocket is and tell me some interesting technical aspects of how it works sure new glenn is a a very large a heavy lift launch vehicle it'll take about forty five metric tons to leo very very large class it's about half the thrust a little more than half the thrust of the saturn five rocket so it's about three point nine million pounds of thrust on liftoff the booster has seven be four engines the each engine generates a little more than five hundred and fifty thousand pounds of thrust the engines are fueled by liquid natural gas liquefied natural gas lng as the fuel and lox as the oxidizer the cycle is an ox rich stage combustion cycle it's a cycle that was really pioneered by the russians it's a very good cycle and that engine is also going to power the first stage of the vulcan rocket which is the united launch alliance rocket then the second stage of new glenn is powered by two be3u engines which is a upper stage variant of our new shepard liquid hydrogen engine so the b e three u has a hundred and sixty thousand pounds of thrust so two of those three hundred and twenty thousand pounds of thrust and hydrogen is a very good propellant for upper stages because it has very high isp it's not a great propellant in my view for booster stages because the stages then get physically so large hydrogen has very high isp but liquid hydrogen is very is not dense at all so to store liquid hydrogen you know if you need to store many thousands of pounds of liquid hydrogen your your tanks your liquid hydrogen tank gets very large so you really you get more benefit from the higher isp the specific impulse you get more benefit from the higher specific impulse on the second stage and that stage carries less propellant so you don't get such geometrically gigantic tanks the delta four is an example of a vehicle that is all hydrogen the booster stage is also hydrogen mhmm and i think that it's a very effective vehicle but it never was very cost effective so it's operationally very capable but not very cost effective so size is also costly size is costly so it's interesting rockets love to be big mhmm everything works better what do you mean by that you've told me that before it sounds epic but what's it i mean when you look at the kind of the physics of rocket engines and also when you look at parasitic mass it doesn't if you have let's say you have an avionic system so you have a guidance and control system that is gonna be about the same mass and size for a giant rocket as it is gonna be for a tiny rocket mhmm and so that's just parasitic mass that is very consequential if you're building a very small rocket but is trivial if you're building a very large rocket so you have the parasitic mass thing and then if you look at for example rocket engines have turbo pumps they have to pressurize the fuel and the oxidizer up to a very high pressure level in order to inject it into the thrust chamber where it burns and those pumps all rotating machines in fact get more efficient as they get larger so really tiny turbo pumps are very challenging to manufacture and any kind of gaps you know are like be between the housing for example and the rotating impeller that pressurizes the fuel there has to be some gap there you can't have those parts scraping against one another and those gaps drive inefficiencies and so you know if you have a very large turbo pump those gaps and percentage terms end up being very small and so there's a bunch of things that that that you end up loving about having a large rocket and that you end up hating for a small rocket but there's a giant exception to this rule and it is manufacturing so manufacturing large structures is very very challenging it's a pain in the butt and so you know it's just you know if you have if you're making a small rocket engine you can move all the pieces by hand you could assemble it on a table one person can do it you know you don't need cranes and heavy lift operations and tooling and so on and so on when you start building big objects infrastructure civil infrastructure just like the launchpad and the you know all this we we went and visited i took you to the launchpad and you can see it's so monumental yeah it is and so just these things become major undertakings both from an engineering point of view but also from a construction and cost point of view and even the the foundation of the launch pad i mean this is florida like isn't like swampland like how deep do you have to go at cape canaveral yeah infected most ocean you know most launch pads are on beaches somewhere at the ocean side because you wanna launch over water for safety reasons the yes you have to drive pilings you know dozens and dozens and dozens of pilings you know fifty a hundred a hundred and fifty feet deep to get enough structural integrity for these very large you know it's it's yes these turn into major civil engineering projects i just have to say everything about that factory is pretty badass you said tooling the bigger it gets the more the more epic it is it does make it epic yeah it's fun to look at it's extraordinary it's humbling also because your humans are so small compared to it we are building these in enormous machines that are harnessing enormous amounts of chemical power you know in very very compact packages it's truly extraordinary but then there's all the different components and that you you know the materials involved is there something interesting that you can describe about the materials that's comprised the rocket so it has to be as light as possible i guess whilst withstanding the heat under the harsh conditions yeah i play a little kind of game sometimes with other rocket people that i run into where say what are the things that would amaze the nineteen sixties engineers mhmm like what what's changed because yeah surprisingly some of rocketry's greatest hits have not changed they are still they would recognize immediately a lot of what we do today and it's exactly what they pioneered back in the sixties but a few things have changed you know the use of carbon composites is is very different today you know we can build very sophisticated you saw our carbon tape laying machine that builds the giant fairings yeah and we can build these incredibly light very stiff fairing structures out of carbon composite material that they could not have dreamed of i mean the the efficiency the structural efficiency of that material is so high compared to any you know metallic material you might use or anything else so that's one aluminum lithium and the ability to friction stir weld aluminum lithium do you remember the friction stir welding that i showed you this this is a a remarkable technology it was invented decades ago but has become very practical over the just the last couple of decades and instead of using heat to weld two pieces of metal together it literally stirs the two pieces there's a a pin that rotates at a certain rate and you put that pin between the two plates of metal that you want to weld together and then you move it at a at a very precise speed and instead of heating the material it heats it a little bit because of friction but not very much you can literally immediately after welding with stir friction welding you can touch the material when it's it's just barely warm it's it literally stirs the molecules together it's quite extraordinary relatively low temperature and i guess high temperature is what makes them the the that's the weak that makes it a weak point exactly so in with tradition with traditional welding techniques you may have whatever the underlying strength characteristics of the material are you end up with weak regions where you weld mhmm and with friction stir welding the welds are just as strong as the bulk material mhmm so it really allows you and so because when you're you know let's say you're building a tank that you're gonna pressurize you know a large you know liquid natural gas tank for our for our booster stage for example you know if you are welding that with traditional methods you have to size those weld lands the thickness of those pieces with that knockdown for whatever damage you're doing with the weld and that's gonna add a lot of weight to that tank i mean even just looking at the fairings the result of that the the complex shape that it takes and yeah and like what it's supposed to do is kind of incredible because it so people don't know it's on top of the rocket it's gonna fall apart that's its task but it has to stay strong sometimes yes and then disappear when it needs to that's right which is a very difficult task yes when you need something that needs to have one hundred percent integrity until it needs to have zero percent integrity it needs to stay attached until it's ready to go away and then when it goes away it has to go away completely you use explosive charges for that and so it's a very robust way of separating structure when you need to exploding yeah little little tiny bits of explosive material and it just it'll sever the whole connection so if you wanna go from one hundred percent structural integrity to zero as fast as possible it's explosives use explosives the entirety of this thing is so badass okay so we're back to the two stages so the the first stage is reusable yeah second stage is expendable second stage is liquid hydrogen liquid oxygen so we get take advantage of the higher specific impulse the the first stage lands downrange on a landing platform in the ocean comes back for maintenance and get ready to do the next mission i mean there's a million questions but also is there a a path towards reusability for the second stage there is and we know how to do that right now we're gonna work on manufacturing that second stage to make it as inexpensive as possible so two paths for a second stage make it reusable or work really hard to make it inexpensive so you can afford to expend it and the that trade is actually not obvious which one is better even in terms of cost and even like time even in terms of cost i'm talking about cost is it you know space flight getting into orbit is a solved problem we solved it back in you know the fifties and sixties you're making it sound crazy the the only thing that the only interesting problem is dramatically reducing the cost of access to orbit which is if you can do that you open up a bunch of new you know endeavors that lots of start up companies everybody else can do so that's we really that's our one of our missions is to you know be part of this industry and lower the cost to orbit so that there can be you know a kind of a renaissance a golden age of people doing all kinds of interesting things in space i like how you said getting to orbit is a solved problem it's just the only interesting thing is reducing the cost you know how you can describe every single problem facing human civilization that way i mean the physicists would say everything is a solved problem we've solved everything the rest is just what was the rutherford said that it's just stamp collecting it's just the detail some of the greatest innovations and inventions and you know brilliance is in that cost reduction stage right and you've you've had a long career of cost reduction for sure and if you know when you what does cost reduction really mean it means inventing a better way yeah exactly right and when you invent a better way you make the whole world richer so you know whatever it was i don't know how many thousands of years ago somebody invented the plow mhmm and when they invented the plow they made the whole world richer because they made farming less expensive and so it it is a big deal to to invent better ways that's how the world gets richer so what are some of the the biggest challenges on the manufacturing side and the engineering side that you're facing in working to get to the first launch of new glenn the first launch is one thing we'll and we'll do that in twenty twenty four coming up in this coming year the real thing that's the bigger challenge is making sure that our factory is efficiently manufacturing at rate so rate production so consider if you wanna launch new glenn you know twenty four times a year you need to manufacture a upper stage since they're expendable every you know twice a month you need to do it every two weeks so you need to be you need to have all of your manufacturing facilities and processes and inspection techniques and acceptance tests and everything operating at rate and rate manufacturing is at least as difficult as designing the vehicle in the first place and the same thing so every every upper stage has two b e three u engines so those engines you know you need if you're gonna launch the the the vehicle twice a month you need four engines a month so you need an engine every week so you need to be that engine needs to be being produced at rate and and that's a and there's all of the things that you need to do that all the right machine tools all the right fixtures the right people process etcetera so it's one thing to build a first article mhmm right so that's you you know we to launch new glenn for the first time you need to produce a first article but that's not the hard part the hard part is everything that's going on behind the scenes to build a factory that can produce new glints at rate so the first one is produced in a way that enables the production of the second third and the fourth and the fifth and sixth you could think of the first article as kind of pushing it it pushes all of the rate manufacturing technology along you know in other words it's kind of the you know it's the test article in a way that's testing out your your manufacturing technologies the manufacturing is the big challenge yes i mean i don't wanna make it sound like any of it is easy i mean the people who are designing the engines and all this like all of it is hard for sure but the but the challenge right now is driving really hard to get to is to get to rate manufacturing and to do that in an efficient way again kind of back to our cost point if you get to rate manufacturing in an inefficient way you haven't really solved the cost problem and maybe you're have it really moved the state of the art forward all this has to be about moving the state of the art forward there are easier easier businesses to do i always tell people look if you are trying to make money you know like start a salty snack food company or something you know you you write that idea down like make the lex fridman potato chips you know this this don't don't say it the people are gonna steal it but yeah it's hard you see what i was saying it's like there's nothing easy about this business and but but it's its own reward it's it's it's it's fascinating it's worthwhile it's meaningful and so you know i you know not i don't wanna pick on salty snack food companies but i think it's it's less meaningful you know at the end of the day you're not gonna you're you're not gonna have accomplished something amazing yeah there's even if you do make a lot of money at it yeah there's something fundamentally different about the the quote unquote business of space exploration yeah and it's a for sure it's a grand project of humanity yes it's one of humanity's grand challenges and especially as you look at going to the moon and going to mars and building giant o'neil colonies and unlocking all the you know i won't live long enough to see the fruits of this but the fruits of this come from building a road to space getting the infrastructure i give you an analogy when i started amazon i didn't have to develop a payment system it already existed it was called the credit card i didn't have to develop a transportation system to deliver the packages it already existed it was called the postal service and royal mail and deutsche post and so and so all this heavy lifting infrastructure was already in place and i could stand on its shoulders and that's why when you look at the internet you know and by the way another giant piece of infrastructure that was around in the early i'm taking you back to like nineteen ninety four people were using dial up modems and it was piggybacking on top of the long distance phone network that's how the internet that's you know how people were accessing servers and so on and that again if if that hadn't existed it would have been hundreds of billions of capex to to put that out there no startup company could have done that and so the problem you know you see in if you look at the dynamism in the internet space over the last twenty years it's because you know you see like two kids in a dorm room could start an internet company that could be successful and do amazing things because they didn't have to build heavy infrastructure it was already there and that's what i wanna do i'd take you know my amazon winnings and use that to build heavy infrastructure so that the next generation you know my the generation that's my children and their children is you know the those generations can then use that heavy infrastructure then there'll be space entrepreneurs who start in their dorm room yeah like that that will be a marker of success when you can have a really valuable space company started in a dorm room then we know that we've built enough infrastructure so that ingenuity and imagination can really be unleashed i find that very exciting as they will of course as kids do take all of this hard infrastructure building for granted of course which is an entrepreneurial spirit that's a an inventor's greatest dream yeah is that their inventions are so successful that they are one day taken for granted you know nobody thinks of amazon as an invention anymore nobody thinks of customer reviews as an we pioneer customer reviews but now they're so commonplace same thing with one click shopping and so on yeah but that's a compliment that's how you know you you said you invent something that's so used so beneficially used by so many people that they take it for granted i don't know about nobody i every time i use amazon i'm still amazed how does this work the logistics the the well you you that that proves you're a very curious explorer alright alright back to rockets timeline you said twenty twenty four as it stands now are both the first test launch and the launch of the escapade explorers to mars still possible in twenty twenty four yeah yeah i think so for sure the first launch and then we'll see if if escapade goes on that or not i think that the first launch for sure and i hope escapade too hope well i just don't know which mission is is actually gonna be slated on yeah so we also have other things that might go on that first mission oh i got it but you're optimistic that the launches will still oh the first launch i'm very optimistic that the first launch of new glenn will be in twenty twenty four and i'm just not a hundred percent certain what payload will be on that first launch are you nervous about it are you kidding i'm extremely nervous about it oh man a hundred percent i've you know every every launch i go to you know for new shepard for other vehicles too i'm always nervous for these launches but yes for sure a first launch to have no nervousness about that would be you know some sign of derangement i think so well i got to visit the launch but it's pretty i mean it's epic you know we have done a tremendous amount of ground testing a tremendous amount of simulation so you know a lot of the problems that we might find in flight have been resolved but there are some problems you can only find in flight so you know cross your fingers i guarantee you you'll you'll have fun watching it no matter what happens one hundred percent when the thing is fully assembled it comes up yeah the the the transporter erector just just the transporter erector for a rocket of this scale yeah is extraordinary that's an incredible machine vehicle travels out horizontally and then kind of yeah you know comes up and over a few hours you know yeah it's a beautiful thing to watch speaking of which if that makes you nervous i don't know if you remember but you were aboard new shepard on its first crewed flight how was that experience were you were you terrified then you know strangely i wasn't you know i you ride the rocket it's true wrecking okay i've watched other people ride the rocket and i'm more nervous than when i was inside the rocket myself it was a difficult conversation to have with my mother when i told her i was gonna go on the first one yeah and not only was i gonna go but i was gonna bring my brother too this is a tough conversation to have with a mom and there's a long pause i told her she's like both of you it it it was an incredible experience and we were we were laughing in inside the capsule and you know we're not nervous the people on the ground were very nervous for us it was actually one of the most emotionally powerful parts of the experience was not it happened even before the flight at four thirty in the morning brother and i are getting ready to go to the launch site and lauren is gonna take us there in her helicopter and we're getting ready to leave and we go outside outside the ranch house there in in west texas where the launch facility is and all of our family my kids and my brother's kids and our you know our our our parents and close friends are assembled there and they're saying goodbye to us but they're kind of saying maybe they think they're saying goodbye to us forever mhmm and you know we might not have felt that way but it was obvious from their faces how nervous they were that they felt that way and it was sort of powerful because it allowed us to see it was almost like attending your own memorial service or something like you could feel how loved you were in that moment and it was it was really amazing yeah and i mean there's just a epic nature to it too the ascent floating in zero gravity i'll tell you something very interesting zero gravity feels very natural i don't know if it's because we're you know it's like return to the womb or what an alien but that's i think that's what i think that's what you just said it feels so natural to be in zero g it was really interesting and then when people talk about the overview effect and seeing earth from space i had that feeling very powerfully i think everyone did you see how fragile the earth is if you're not an environmentalist it will make you one the the great jim lovell quote you know he looked back at the earth from space and he said he realized you don't go to heaven when you die you go to heaven when you're born and it's just you know that's the feeling that people get when they're in space you see all this blackness all this nothingness and there's one gem of life and it's earth it is a gem what you know you're you've talked a lot about decision making throughout your time with amazon what was that decision like to to ride to be the first to ride new shepard like what just be before you talk to your mom yeah what what like what the pros and cons like actually as one human being as a as a leader of a company on all fronts like what was that decision making like i decided that first of all i knew the vehicle extremely well i know the team who built it i know the vehicle the i'm very comfortable with the like the escape system we put as much effort into the escape system on that vehicle as we put into all the rest of the vehicle combined it's one of the hardest pieces of engineering in the entire new shepard architecture can you actually describe what do you mean by escape system what's involved we have a solid rocket motor in the base of the crew capsule so that if anything goes wrong on ascent you know while the main rocket engine is firing we can ignite this solid rocket motor in the base of the crew capsule and escape from the booster it's a very challenging system to build design validate test all of these things it is the reason that i am comfortable letting anyone go on to shepherd so the the the booster is as safe and reliable as we can make it but we are harnessing whenever you're talking about rocket engines i don't care what rocket engine you're talking about you are harnessing such vast power in such a small compact geometric space the power density is so enormous that it is impossible to ever be sure that nothing will go wrong mhmm and so the only way to improve safety is to have an escape system and you know and historically rockets human rated rockets have had escape systems only the space shuttle did not and but apollo had one the you know all of the previous you know gemini etcetera they all had escape systems and we have on new shepard an unusual escape most escape systems are towers we have a pusher escape system so the solid rocket motor is actually embedded in the base of the crew capsule and it pushes and it's reusable in the sense that if we don't use it so if we have a nominal mission we land with it the tower systems have to be ejected at a certain point in the mission and so they get wasted even in a nominal mission and so again you know cost really matters on these things so we figured out how to have the escape system be a reusable in the event that it's not used it can reuse it and have it be a pusher system it's a very sophisticated thing so i knew these things you asked me about my decision to go and so i know the vehicle very well i know the people who designed it i have great trust in them and in the engineering that we did and i thought to myself look if i am not ready to go then i wouldn't want anyone to go a tourism vehicle has to be designed in my view to have very to be as safe as one can make it you can't make it perfectly safe it's impossible but you know you just have to people will do thing people take risk you know they climb mountains they you know they skydive they you know do deep underwater scuba diving and so on people are okay taking risk you can't eliminate the risk but it is something because it's a tourism vehicle you have to do your utmost to eliminate those risks and i felt very good about the system i think it's one of the reasons i was so calm inside and maybe others weren't as calm they didn't know as much about it as i did who was in charge of engaging the escape system did you have it's automated okay the escape system is i was visualizing it it's it's completely automated automated is better because it can react so much faster so yeah for for tourism rockets safety is a huge huge huge priority for space exploration also but a little a tiny you know a delta less yes i mean i think for you know if you're doing you know there are human activities where we tolerate more risk if you're saving somebody's life you know if you are you know engaging in real exploration these are things where you know i personally think you we would accept more risk in part because you have to is there a part of you that's frustrated by the rate of progress in blue origin blue origin needs to be much faster and it's one of the reasons that i left my role as the ceo of amazon a couple of years ago i needed i wanted to come in and blue origin needs me right now and so i had always when i was the ceo of amazon my point of view on this is is if i'm the ceo of a publicly traded company it's gonna get my full attention and i really it's just how i think about things i it was very important to me i felt i had an obligation to all the stakeholders at amazon to do that and so having you know turned to ceo i was still the executive chair there but i've turned the ceo role over and the reason the primary reason i did that is so that i could spend time on the origin adding some you know energy some sense of urgency we need to move much faster and we're going to what are the ways to speed it up so i mean there there's you've talked a lot of different ways to sort of at at at amazon you know removing barriers for for for progress sort of distributing making everybody autonomous and self reliant in term although all those kinds of things is that apply at blue origin or is it does apply i know i'm leading this directly we are gonna become the world's most decisive company across any industry and so you know at amazon for you know forever since the beginning i said we're gonna become the world's most customer obsessed company and no matter the industry like people one day people are going to come to amazon from the health care industry and wanna know how did you guys how do you how are you so customer obsessed how do you act not just pay lip service that but actually do that and from you know all all different industries should come on a study us to see how we accomplish that and the analogous thing at blue origin and will help us move faster is we're gonna become the world's most decisive company we're gonna get really good at taking appropriate technology risk making those decisions quickly you know being bold on those things that's what and and having the right culture that supports that you need people to be ambitious technically ambitious you know if there are five ways to do something we'll study them but let's study them very quickly and make a decision we can always change our mind it doesn't you know changing your mind is i talk about one way doors and two way doors most decisions are two way doors can you explain that because i i love that metaphor if you make the wrong decision if it's a two way door decision you walk out the door you pick a door you walk out and you spend a little time there it turns out to be the wrong decision you can come back in and pick another door some decisions are so consequential and so important and so hard to reverse that they really are one way door decisions you go in that door you're not coming back mhmm and those decisions have to be made very deliberately very carefully if you can think of yet another way to analyze the decision you should slow down and do that so you know when i the ceo of amazon i often found myself in the position of being the chief slowdown officer mhmm because somebody would be bringing me a one way door decision and i was okay i can think of three more ways to analyze that so let's go do that because we we are not gonna be able to reverse this one easily if we maybe you can reverse if it's gonna be very costly and very time consuming we really have to get this one right from the beginning and what happens unfortunately in companies what can happen is that you have a one size fits all decision making process where you end up using the heavyweight process on all decisions for everything yeah including the lightweight ones the the two way door decisions two way door decisions should mostly be made by single individuals or by very small teams deep in the organization mhmm and one way door decisions are the ones that that are the universal ones those are the ones that should be elevated up to you know the senior most executives who should slow them down and make sure that the right thing is being done yeah i mean part of the skill here is to to to know the difference between one way and two way i think you mentioned yes yeah i mean i think you mentioned amazon prime the decision to sort of create amazon prime as a one way door and i mean it's not it's unclear if it is or not but it probably is and it's a really big risk to go there there are a bunch of decisions like that that are you know changing the decision is gonna be very very complicated some of them are technical decisions too because some technical decisions are like quick drying cement you know if you're gonna once you make them it gets really hard i mean you know choosing which propellants to use in a vehicle you know selecting lng for the booster stage and selecting hydrogen for the upper stage that has turned out to be a very good decision but if you change your mind that would be a very that would be a very big setback mhmm do you see what i was saying yeah so that's the kind of decision you scrutinize very very carefully other things just aren't like that most decisions are not that way most decisions should be made by single individuals but they need and and and done quickly in the full understanding that you can always change your mind yeah one of the things i really liked perhaps it's not a two way door decisions is i disagree and commit phrase so don't so somebody brings up an idea to you if it's a two way door you state that you don't understand enough to agree but you still back them i'd love for you to explain that i'm just trying to commit is a really important principle that saves a lot of arguing yeah so you know i'm gonna use that in my personal life i disagree but commit like it's very common in any endeavor in life in business and any you know anybody where you have teammates you have a teammate and the two of you disagree yeah at some point you have to make a decision and you know in companies we tend to organize hierarchically so there's this you know whoever is the more senior person ultimately gets to make the decision so ultimately the ceo gets to make that decision and the ceo may not always make the decision that they agree with so like you know i would i would often i would be the one who would disagree and commit some one of my direct reports would very much wanna do it do something in a particular way i would think it was a bad idea i would explain my point of view they would say i jeff i think you're wrong and here's why and we would go back and forth and i would often say you know what i don't think you're right but i'm gonna gamble with you and you're closer to the ground truth than i am i'd known you for twenty years you have great judgment i don't know that i'm right either not really not for sure all these decisions are complicated let's do it your way but at least then you've made a decision and i and i'm agreeing to commit to that decision so i'm not gonna be second guessing it i'm not gonna be sniping at it i'm not gonna be saying i told you so i'm gonna try actively to help make sure it works that's a really important teammate behavior there's so many ways that dispute resolution is a really interesting thing in on teams and there are so many ways when two people disagree about something even the i'm i'm assuming what the case where everybody is well intentioned they just have a very different opinion about what the right decision is and we have in our society and inside companies we have a bunch of mechanisms that we use to resolve these kinds of disputes a lot of them are i think really bad so an example of a really bad way of coming to agreement is compromise so compromise you know look i here's we're in a room here and i could say lex how tall do you think this ceiling is and you'd be like i don't know jeff maybe twelve feet tall and i would say i i think it's eleven feet tall yeah and then we'd say you know what let's just call it eleven and a half feet that's compromised yeah instead of the right thing to do is you know to get a tape measure or figure out some way of actually measuring but think getting that tape measure and figure out how to get it to the top of the ceiling and all these things that requires energy compromise the advantage of compromise as a resolution mechanism is that it's low energy but it doesn't lead to truth and so in things like the height of the ceiling where truth is a noble thing you shouldn't allow compromise to be used when you can know the truth mhmm another really bad resolution mechanism that happens all the time is just who's more stubborn yeah this is also so you have let's say two executives who disagree and they just have a war of attrition and whichever one gets exhausted first capitulates to the other one again you haven't arrived at truth and this is very demoralizing so you know this is where escalation i i try to ask people who you know on my team it's a never get to a point where you are resolving something by you know who gets exhausted first escalate that i'll help you make the decision like let's because that's so deenergizing and such a terrible lousy way to make a decision do you wanna get to the resolution as quickly as possible because that ultimately leads to high velocity of the yes and you wanna try to get as close to truth as possible yeah so you want like you know exhausting the other person is not truth seeking yes and compromise is not truth seeking so you know it doesn't mean no and there are a lot of cases where no one knows the real truth and that's where disagree and commit can come in but it's it's escalation is better than war of attrition escalate just you know to your boss and say hey we can't agree on this we like each other we're respectful of each other but we strongly disagree with each other we need you to you know make a decision here so we can move forward but decisiveness moving forward quickly on on decisions as quickly as as you responsibly can is how you increase velocity most of what slows things down is in is taking too long to make decisions at all skill levels you know so it has to be part of the culture to get high velocity you know amazon has a million and a half people and the company is still fast we're still decisive we're still quick and that's because the culture supports that at every scale in a in a distributed way yes to maximize the velocity of decisions exactly you've mentioned the lunar program let me ask you about that yeah there's a a lot going on there and you haven't really talked about it much so in addition to the artemis program with nasa blue is doing its own lander program can you describe it there's a there's a sexy picture on instagram with with one of them is it the m k one i guess yeah the mark one is it your the picture here is it me with bill nelson the yeah nasa administrator just to clarify the lander is the sexy thing about the i just really wanna clarify i know it's not me i know it was either you the lander or bill okay i love bill but terrifying okay the yes the mark one lander is designed to take three thousand kilograms to the surface of the moon the cargo expendable cargo it's expendable lander lands on the moon stays there take three thousand kilograms to the surface it can be launched on a single new glenn flight which is very important so it's a relatively simple architecture just like the human landing system lander that they call the mark two mark one is also fueled with liquid hydrogen and which is for for high energy missions like landing on the surface of the moon the high specific impulse of hydrogen is a very big advantage the disadvantage of hydrogen has always been that it's since it's such a deep cryogen it's not storable so it's constantly boiling off and you're losing propellant because it's boiling off and so what we're doing as part of the of our lunar program is developing solar powered cryocoolers that can actually make hydrogen a storable propellant for deep space and that's a real game changer it's a game changer for any high energy mission so to the moon but to the outer planets to mars everywhere so the idea with mark one both mark one and mark two is the new glenn can carry it from the surface of earth to the surface of the moon exactly so the mark one is expendable the lunar the the lunar lander we're developing for nasa the mark two lander that's part of the artemisburg they call it the sustaining lander program so that lander is designed to be reusable it can land on the surface of the moon in a in a single stage configuration and then take off so the whole the you know the if you look at the apollo program the lunar lander in apollo was really two stages it would land on the surface and then it would leave the descent stage on the surface of the moon and only the ascent stage would go back up into lunar orbit where it would rendezvous with the command module here what we're doing is we have a single stage lunar lander that carries down enough propellant so that it can bring the whole thing back up so that it can be reused over and over and the point of doing that of course is to reduce cost so that you can make lunar missions more affordable over time which is that's one of nasa's big objectives because this time the the whole point of artemis is go back to the moon but this time to stay mhmm so you know back in the apollo program we went to the moon six times and then ended the program and it really was too expensive to to continue and so there's a few questions there but one is how do you stay on the moon what what ideas do you have about yeah like a sustain sustaining life where a few folks can stay there for prolonged periods of time well one of the things we're working on is using lunar resources like lunar regolith mhmm to manufacture commodities and even solar cells on the surface of the moon we've already built a solar cell that is completely made from lunar regolith simulant and this solar cell is only about seven percent power efficient so it's very inefficient compared to you know the more advanced solar cells that we make here on earth but if you can figure out how to make a practical solar cell factory that you can land on the surface of the moon and then the raw material for those solar cells is simply lunar regolith then you can just you know continue to churn out solar cells on the surface of the moon have lots of power on the surface of the moon that will make it easier for people to live on the moon similarly we're working on extracting oxygen from lunar regolith so lunar regolith by weight is has a lot of oxygen in it it's bound very tightly you know in as oxides with other elements and so it you have to separate the oxygen which is very energy intensive so that also could work together with the solar cells but if you can and then ultimately we may be able to find practical quantities of ice in the permanently shadowed craters on the poles of the moon and we know there is ice water in those or water ice in those craters and and we know that we can break that down with electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen and then you'd not only have oxygen but you'd also have a very good high efficiency propellant fuel in in hydrogen so there's a lot there's a lot we can do to make the moon more sustainable over time but the very first step the thing the kind of gate that all of that has to go through is we need to be able to land cargo and humans on the surface of the moon at an acceptable cost to fast forward a little bit is there any chance jeff bezos steps foot on the moon and on mars one or the other or both it's very unlikely i think it's probably something that gets done by future generations by the time it gets to me i think in my lifetime that's probably gonna be done by professional astronauts mhmm sadly i would love to sign up for that mission so don't count me out yet lex you know give me give me a finding shot here maybe but i think if we're if we are placing reasonable bets on such a thing in my lifetime that will continue to be done by professional astronauts yeah so these are risky difficult missions and probably missions that require a lot of training you know you are going there for a very specific purpose to do something we're gonna be able to do a lot on the moon too with automation so you know in terms of setting up these factories and doing all that that we we're sophisticated enough now with automation that we probably don't need humans to tend those factories and machines so it's there's a lot that's gonna be done in both modes so i have to ask the bigger picture question about the two companies pushing humanity forward out towards the stars blue origin and spacex are you competitors collaborators which and to what degree well i would say you know just like the internet is big and there are lots of winners at all skill levels i mean there are half a dozen giant companies that you know the internet has made but they're a bunch of medium sized companies and a bunch of small companies all successful all with profit streams all driving great customer experiences that's what we wanna see in space mhmm that kind of dynamism and space is big there's room for a bunch of winners and it's gonna happen at all skill levels and so you know spacex is gonna be successful for sure i want blue origin to be successful and i hope there are another you know five companies right behind us but you know i spoke to elon a few times recently about you about blue origin and he was very positive about you as a person and very supportive of all the efforts you've been leading at blue what's your thoughts you worked with a lot of leaders at amazon at blue what's your thoughts about elon as a human being and a leader well i don't really know elon very well you know i know his public persona but i also know you can't know anyone by their public persona it's impossible i mean you may think you do but i guarantee you don't so i don't really know you know elon way better than i do lex but in in terms of his judging by the results he must be a very capable leader there's no way you could have you know tesla and spacex without being a capable leader it's impossible yeah i just i i hope you guys hang out sometimes shake hands and and sort of have a kind of friendship that would inspire just the entirety of humanity because you what you're doing is like one of the big grand challenges ahead for humanity well i agree with you and i think in a lot of these endeavors we're very like minded yeah so i think you know i think i'm not saying we're identical but i think we're very like minded and so i you know i i i love that idea alright going back to sexy pictures on your instagram there's a video of you from the early days of amazon giving a tour of your quote instead of offices i think your dad is holding the camera he is yeah i know right yes this is what the giant orange extension cord and yeah and you're like explaining the the genius of the extension cord and how this is a desk and the crt monitor and sort of that's where the that's where all the magic happens i forget what your dad said but this is like the the the center of it all so what was it like what's going through your mind at that time you left a good job in new york and took this leap were you excited were you scared so excited and scared anxious you know thought the odds of success were low told all of our early investors that i thought there was a thirty percent chance of success by which i just been getting your money back not like turning on what actually happened because that's the truth every startup company is unlikely to work it's helpful to be in reality about that but that doesn't mean you can't be optimistic so you kind of have to have this duality in your head like you on the one hand you're you know what the baseline statistics say about startup companies and the other hand you have to ignore all of that and just be a hundred percent sure it's gonna work and you're doing both things at the same time you're holding that contradiction in your head but it was so so exciting i i love you know every from nineteen ninety four when the company was founded to nineteen ninety five when we opened our doors all the way until today it's i find amazon so exciting and that doesn't mean it's like full of pain full of problems you know it's like there's so many things that need to be resolved and worked and made better and and etcetera but but on balance it's so fun it's such a privilege it's been such a joy i feel so grateful that i've been part of that journey it's just been incredible so in some sense you don't want a a single day of comfort you've written about this many times we'll talk about your writing which i i would highly recommend people read in just the letters to shareholders so you you wrote up explaining the idea of day one thinking i think you first wrote about it in ninety seven letters to shareholders then you also in a way wrote about sad to say is your last letter to shareholders and ceo and you said that day two is stasis followed by irrelevance followed by excruciating painful decline followed by death and that is why it's always day one can can you explain this day one thing this is a really powerful way to describe the beginning and the journey of amazon it's it's really a very simple and i think age old idea about renewal and rebirth and like every day is day one every day you're deciding what you're gonna do and you are not trapped by what you were or who you were or any self consistency self consistency even can be a trap and so day one thinking is kind of we start fresh every day and we get to make new decisions every day about invention about customers about how we're going to operate what our even even even as deeply as what our principles are we can go back to that turns out we don't change those very often but we change them occasionally and when we work on programs at amazon we often make a list of tenants and this and the tenants are kind of they're not principles they're a little more tactical than principles but it's kind of the the main ideas that we want this program to embody whatever those are and one of the things that we do is we put these are the tenants for this program and then when in parentheses we always put unless you know a better way mhmm and that idea unless you know a better way is so important because you never want to get trapped by dogma you never wanna get trapped by history it doesn't mean you discard history or ignore it there's so much value in what has worked in the past and but you can't be blindly following what you've done and that's the heart of day one is you're always starting fresh and to the question of how to fend off day two you said such a question can't have a simple answer as you're saying there will be many elements multiple paths and many traps i don't know the whole answer but i may know bits of it here's a starter pack of essentials maybe others come to mind for day one defense customer obsession skeptical view of proxies the eager adoption of external trends and high velocity decision making so we talked about high velocity decision making that's more difficult than it sounds so maybe you can pick one that stands out to you as you can comment on eager adoption of external trends high velocity decision making skeptical view of proxies how do you fight off day two well you know i'll talk about because i think it's the one that is maybe in some ways the hardest to understand is the skeptical view of proxies one of the things that happens in business probably anything that you're where you're you know you have an ongoing program and something is is underway for a number of years is you develop certain things that you're managing to like let's say the typical case would be a metric and that metric isn't the real underlying thing and so you know maybe the metric is efficiency metric around customer contacts per unit sold or something like if you sell a million units how many customer contacts do you get or how many returns do you get and so on and so on and so what happens is a little bit of a kind of inertia sets in where somebody a long time ago invented that metric and they invented that metric they decided we need to watch for you know customer returns per unit sold as an important metric but they had a reason why they chose that metric the person who invented that metric and decided it was worth watching and then fast forward five years that metric is the proxy mhmm the proxy for truth i guess the proxy for truth the proxy for customers say in this case it's a proxy for customer happiness and but that metric is not actually customer happiness it's a proxy for customer happiness the person who invented the metric understood that connection five years later it a kind of inertia can set in and you forget the truth behind why you were watching that metric in the first place and the world shifts a little yeah and now that proxy isn't as valuable as it used to be or it's missing something and you have to be on alert for that you have to know okay this is i don't really care about this metric i care about customer happiness and this metric is worth putting energy into and following and improving and scrutinizing only in so much as it actually affects customer happiness and so you gotta constantly be on guard and it's very very common this is a nuanced problem it's very common especially in large companies that they are managing to metrics that they don't really understand they don't really know why they exist and the world may have shifted off from under them a little and the metrics are no longer as relevant as they were when somebody ten years earlier invented the metric that is a nuance but that's a big problem right that's a huge problem something so compelling to have a nice metric to try to optimize yes and by the way you do need metrics yes you do you know you can't ignore them and want them but you just have to be constantly on guard this is you know a a way to slip into day two thinking mhmm would be to manage your business to metrics that you don't really understand and you're not really sure why they were invented in the first place and you're not sure they're still as relevant as they used to be what does it take to be a the guy or gal who who who brings up the point that this proxy might be outdated i guess what does it take to have a culture that enables that in the meeting because that's a very uncomfortable thing to bring up at a meeting we all show up here as a friday this is such you have just asked a million dollar question so this is this is what you're if i generalize what you're asking you're talking in general about truth telling yeah and we humans are not really truth seeking animals we are social animals yeah we are and you know take you back in time ten thousand years and you're in a small village if you go along to get along you can survive you can procreate if you're the village truth teller you might get clubbed to death in the middle of the night truths are often they don't want to be heard because important truths can be uncomfortable they can be awkward they can be exhausting impolite yes and all that kind of stuff challenging yeah they can make people defensive even if that's not the intent but any high performing organization whether it's a sports team a business you know a political organization activist group i don't care what it is any high performing organization has to have mechanisms and a culture that supports truth telling one of the things you have to do is you have to talk about that and you have to talk about the fact that it takes energy to do that you have to talk to people you have to remind people it's okay that it's uncomfortable you have to literally tell people it's not what we're designed to do as humans it's not really it's kind of a side effect you know we can do that but it's not how we survive we mostly survive by being social animals and being cordial and cooperative and that's really important and so there's a you know science is all about truth telling it's actually a very formal mechanism for trying to tell the truth and even in science you find that it's hard to tell the truth right even you know you're supposed to have hypothesis and test it and find data and reject the hypothesis and so on it's not easy mhmm but even in science there's like the senior scientists and the junior scientists correct and then there's a hierarchy of humans where the the hub seniority somehow seniority matters yes in the scientific process which is and that's true inside companies too and so you wanna set up your culture so that the most junior person can overrule the most senior person if they have data and and and that really is about trying to you know there are little things you can do so for example in every meeting that i attend i always speak last and i know from experience that you know if i speak first even very strong willed highly intelligent high judgment participants in that meeting will wonder well if jeff thinks that i came in this meeting thinking one thing but maybe i'm not right and so you can do little things like if you're the most senior person in the room go last let everybody else go first in fact ideally just try to have the most senior person go first and the second then try to go in order of seniority so that you can hear everyone's opinion in a kind of unfiltered way because we really do we actually literally change our opinions if somebody who you really respect says something makes you change your mind a little so you're saying implicitly or explicitly give permission for people to have a strong opinion that as long as it's backed by data yes and sometimes it can even by the way a lot of our most powerful truths turn out to be hunches they turn out to be based on anecdotes yeah they're intuition based and sometimes you don't even have strong data but you may know you may know the person well enough to trust their judgment you may feel yourself leaning in it may resonate with a set of anecdotes you have and then you may be able to say you know something about that feels right let's go collect some data on that let's try to see if we can actually know whether it's right but for now let's not disregard it because it feels right you can also fight inherent bias there's an optimism bias like if there are two interpretations of a new set of data and one of them is happy and one of them is unhappy it's a little dangerous to jump to the conclusion that the happy interpretation is right you may want to sort of compensate for that human bias of of looking for you know trying to find the silver lining and so look this that might be good but i'm gonna go with it's it's bad for now until we're sure so speaking of happiness bias data collection and anecdotes you have to how's that for a transition you have to you have to tell me the story of the the call you made the customer service call you made to demonstrate a point about wait times yeah this is very early in the history of amazon yes and we were going over a weekly business review and a set of documents and i have i have a saying which is when the data and the anecdotes disagree the anecdotes are usually right and and and it doesn't mean you just slavishly go follow the anecdotes then it means you go examine the data because the it's usually not the data is being miscollected it's usually that you're not measuring the right thing and so you know if you have a bunch of customers complaining about something and at the same time you know your metrics look like why are they shouldn't be complaining you should doubt the metrics and an early example of this was we had metrics that showed that our customers were waiting i think less than i don't know sixty seconds when they called a one eight hundred number to get you know phone customer service the wait time was supposed to be less than sixty seconds and but we had a lot of complaints that it was longer than that and anecdotally it seemed longer than that like you know i would call customer service myself and so one day we're in a meeting or going through the wbr and the weekly business review and we get to this metric in the deck and the guy who leads customer service is to fit in the metric and i said okay let's call picked up the phone and i dialed the one eight hundred number and called customer service and we just waited in silence for for the what does it turn out to be oh it was really long more than ten minutes i think oh wow i mean it was it was many minutes and so you know it dramatically made the point that something was wrong with the data collection we weren't measuring the right thing and and that you know set off a whole chain of events where we started measuring it right and that's an example by the way of of truth telling is like that's an uncomfortable thing to do yeah but it's but you have to seek truth even when it's uncomfortable and you have to get people's attention and they have to buy into it and they have to get energized around really fixing things so that that speaks to the the obsession with the customer experience so one of the defining aspects of your approach to amazon is just being obsessed with making customers happy i think companies sometimes say that but amazon is really obsessed with that i think there's something really profound to that which is seeing the world through the eyes of the customer like the customer experience the human being that's using the product that's enjoying the product they're like what their like the subtle little things that make up their experience like how do you optimize those this is another really good and kind of deep question because there are big things that are really important to manage and then there are small things in internally into amazon we call them paper cuts so we have we're always working on the big things like if you ask me and and and most of the energy goes into the big things as it should so and you can identify the big things and and i would encourage anybody if if any you know anybody listening to this is a entrepreneur has a small business whatever you know think about the things that are not going to change over ten years and those are probably the big things so like i know at in our retail business at amazon ten years from now customers are still gonna want low prices i know they're still gonna want fast delivery and i just know they're still gonna want big selection so it's impossible to imagine a scenario where ten years from now i say where customers says i love amazon i just wish the prices were a little higher or i love amazon i just wish you delivered a little more slowly so when you identify the big things you can tell they're worth putting energy into because they're stable in time okay but you're asking about something a little different which is in every customer experience there are those big things and by the way it's astonishingly hard to focus even on just the big things so even though they're obvious they're really hard to focus on but in addition to that there are all these little tiny customer experience deficiencies and we call those paper cuts and we make long lists of them and then we have dedicated teams that go fix paper cuts because the teams working on the big issues never get to the paper cuts and they never work their way down the list to get to they're working on big things as they should and as you want them to and so you need special teams who are charged with fixing paper cuts where would you put on the on this paper cut spectrum the buy now with one click button which is i think pretty genius so to me like okay my interaction with things i love on the internet there's things i do a lot i may be representing a regular human i would love for those things to be frictionless for example booking airline tickets just saying but it you know it's buying a a thing with one click making that experience frictionless intuitive all aspects of that like that that just fundamentally makes my life better not just in terms of efficiency in terms of some kind of cognitive load yeah cognitive load and pee inner peace and happiness first of all buying stuff isn't a pleasant experience have having enough money to buy a thing and then buying it is a pleasant experience and like having pain around that is somehow just you're ruining a a beautiful experience and i guess all i'm saying as a as a person who loves good ideas is that a paper cut a solution to paper cut yes so it's probably that particular thing is probably a solution to a number of paper cuts so if you go back and look at our order pipeline and how people shopped on amazon before we invented one click shopping there were whole there was more friction there was a whole series of paper cuts and that invention eliminated a bunch of paper cuts and i think you're absolutely right by the way that there when you come up with something like one click shopping again this is like so ingrained in people now i'm impressed that you even notice it i mean most people every time i click the button i just just never go surge of happiness this there is in in the perfect invention for the perfect moment in the perfect context there is real beauty yeah it is actual beauty and it feels good it's emotional it's emotional for the inventor it's emotional for the team that builds it it's emotional for the customer it's a big deal and you can feel those things but to to keep coming up with that idea with those kinds of ideas i guess is the the day one thinking effort yeah and you need you need a big group of people who feel that kind of satisfaction with creating that kind of beauty there's a lot of books written about you there's a there's a book invent and wander where walter isaacson does an intro and it's mostly collected writings of yours i've read that i also recommend people check out the founder's podcast that covers you a lot and it does different analysis of different business advice you've given over the years i bring all that up because i saw that there i mentioned that you said that books are an antidote for short attention spans and i forget how it was phrased but that when you were thinking about the kindle that you're thinking about how technology changes us yeah we co evolve yeah with our tools so you know we invent new tools and then our tools change us which is fascinating to think about goes in a circle and there's some aspect you know even just inside business where you don't just make the customer happy but you also have to think about like where is this going to to take humanity if you zoom out a a bit a hundred percent and you know you you can feel in your brain brains are plastic and you can feel your brain getting reprogrammed i remember the first time this happened to me was when tetris who had first came on the scene i'm sure you've had anybody who's been a game player has this experience where you close your eyes to lay down to go to sleep and you see all the little blocks moving and you can you're kind of rotating them in your mind and you can just tell as you walk around the world that you have rewired your brain to play tetris and but that happens with everything and so you know one of the i think yeah we still have yet to see the full repercussions of this i fear but i think one of the things that we've done online you know and largely because of social media is we have trained our brains to be really good at processing super short form content and you know your podcast flies in the face of this you know you you you do these long format things and reading books do too reading books is a long format thing and we all do more of if if you if something is convenient we do more of it and so when you make tools you know that we carry around a little we carry around in our pocket a phone and one of the things that phone does for the most part is it is an attention shortening device because most of the things we do on our phone shorten our attention spans and i'm not even gonna say we know for sure that that's bad but i do think it's happening that's one of the ways we're coevolving with that tool but i think i think it's important to spend some of your time and some of your life doing long attention span things yeah i i think you've spoken about the value in your own life of focus of singular focus on a thing for prolonged periods of time and that's certainly what books do and that's certainly what that piece of technology does but i bring all that up to to ask you about another piece of technology ai that has the potential to have various trajectories to have an impact on human civilization how how do you think ai will change us we're if you're talking about you know generative ai large language models things like cha gpt and its soon successors and these are incredibly powerful technologies to believe otherwise is to bury your head in the sand soon to be even more powerful it's interesting to me that that that large language models in their current form are not inventions they're discoveries you know the telescope was an invention but looking through it at jupiter knowing that it had moons was a discovery like my god it has moons and that's what galileo did and so this is closer on that spectrum of invention you know we know exactly what happens with a seven eighty seven it's an engineered object we designed it we know how it behaves we don't want any surprises large language models are much more like discoveries we're constantly getting surprised by their capabilities they're not really engineered objects then you know you have this debate about whether they're gonna be good for humanity or bad for humanity you know even specialized ai can be very bad for humanity i mean i it's just you know just regular machine learning models that can make you know certain weapons of war that could be incredibly destructive very powerful and they're not general ais they're just they could just be very smart weapons and so we have to think about all of those things i'm very optimistic about this so even in the face of all this uncertainty my own view is that that these powerful tools are much more likely to help us and save us even than they are to on balance hurt us and destroy us i think you know we humans have a lot of ways of we can make ourselves go extinct you know these things may help us not do that mhmm you know so we may actually they may actually save us so the people who are you know overly concerned i in my view overly concerned it's a it's a valid debate i i think that i i think that they may be missing part of the equation which is how helpful they could be in making sure we don't destroy ourselves i don't know if you saw the movie oppenheimer mhmm but to me i've first of all i loved the movie and i thought the best part of the movie is this bureaucrat played by robert downey junior who you know some of the people i've talked to think that's the most boring part of the movie i thought it was the most fascinating because what's going on here is you realize we have invented these awesome destructive powerful technologies called nuclear weapons and they are managed and you know we we we humans are we're not really capable of wielding those weapons yeah where and then that's what he represented in that movie is here's this guy who is just he wrongly thinks he's like being so petty he thinks that he said something that oppenheimer said something bad to einstein about him they didn't talk about him at all as you find out in the final scene of the movie and yet he spent his career trying to be vengeful and and and petty and that's that's the problem we as a species are not really sophisticated enough and mature enough to handle these technologies and so and and by the way before you get to general ai and the the possibility of ai having agency and there's a lot of things would have to happen but there's so much benefit that's gonna come from these technologies in the meantime even before they're you know general ai in terms of better medicines and better tools to develop more technologies and so on so i think it's an incredible moment to be alive and to witness the transformations that are gonna happen how quickly it'll happen no one knows but over the next ten years and twenty years i think we're gonna see really remarkable advances and i personally am very excited about it first of all really interesting to say that it's discoveries that it's true that we don't know the limits of what's possible with the current language models we don't and like what the it could be a few tricks and hacks here and there that that open doors to hold entire new possibilities we do know that humans are doing something different from these models in part because you know we're so power efficient you know the human brain does remarkable things and it does it on about twenty watts of power and you know the the ai techniques we use today use many kilowatts of power to do equivalent tasks so there's something interesting about the way the human brain does this and also we don't need as much data so you know like self driving cars are they have to drive billions and billions of miles to try and to learn how to drive and you know your average sixteen year old figures it out with many fewer miles so there are still some tricks i think that we have yet to learn i don't think we've learned the last trick i don't think it's just a question of scaling things up but what's interesting is that just scaling things up and i put just in quotes because it's actually hard to scale things up but just scaling things up also appears to pay huge dividends yeah and and it's there's some more nuanced aspects about human beings that's interesting if it's able to accomplish like being truly original and novel to you know large language models being able to come up with some truly new ideas that's one and the other one is truth it seems that large language models are very good at sounding like they're saying a true thing but they don't require or often have a grounding in sort of a mathematical truth it can just it basically is a very good bullshitter so if if if there's not enough date if there's not enough sort of data in the in the training data about a particular topic it's just going to concoct accurate sounding narratives which is a very fascinating problem to try to solve how do you get language models to infer what is true and not to sort of introspect yeah they need to be taught to say i don't know i don't know more often yeah and i know of several humans who could be taught that as well sure and and then the other stuff because you're still a bit involved in the amazon side with the ai things the other open question is what kind of products are created from this oh so many yeah i mean you know just to you know we have alexa and echo mhmm and alexa has you know hundreds of millions of installed base you know inputs and so there's this there's you know there's alexa everywhere and guess what alexa is about to get a lot smarter yeah and so that's really you know from a product point of view that's super exciting there's so many opportunities there so many opportunities shopping assistant yeah you know like all that stuff is amazing on aws you know we're building titan which is our foundational model we're also building bedrock which our corporate clients at aws or enterprise clients they want to be able to use these powerful models with their own corporate data yes without accidentally contributing their corporate data to that model yes and so those are the tools we're building for them with bedrock so there's tremendous opportunity here yeah the security the privacy all those things are fascinating of how to because so much value can be gained by training on private data but you wanna keep this secure that's a it's a fascinating technical problem this is a very challenging technical problem and it's one that we're you know making progress on and dedicated to solving for our customers do you think there will be a day when humans and robots maybe alexa have a romantic relationship that could maybe be her well i mean i think if you look at the brainstorming products here if you look at the spectrum of human variety and what people like you know sexual variety yes you know there are people who like everything so the answer to your question has to be yes okay i don't know i guess i'm asking you why widespread that would be alright but it will happen i i was just asking wine for a friend but it's alright i'm just moving on next question what's a perfectly productive day in the life of jeff bezos you're one of the most productive humans in the world well i first of all i get up in the morning and i putter i like i like have a coffee how do you define putter just like i slowly move around i'm not as productive as you might think i am i mean i because i do believe in wandering and i sort of i i you know i read my phone for a while i read newspapers for a while i chat with lauren i drink my first coffee so i kind of i move pretty slowly in the first couple of hours i get up early just naturally and and then you know i exercise most days and most days it's not that hard for me some days it's really hard and i do it anyway i don't want to you know and it's painful and i'm like why am i here and i don't want to do you mean why am i here at the gym why am i here at the gym why don't i do something else you know this it's not always easy what's your source of motivation in those moments i know that i'll feel better later if i do it and so like the the real source of motivation i can tell the days when i skip it mhmm i'm not i'm not quite as alert i don't feel as good and then there's harder motivations it's longer term you wanna be healthy want health span you want ideally you know you wanna be healthy and moving around when you're eighty years old you know and so there's a lot of but that kind of motivation is you know so there's a lot of but that kind of motivation so far in the future it can be very hard to work in the second yeah so thinking about the fact i'll feel better in about four hours if i do it now i have more energy for the rest of my day and so on and so on what's your exercise routine just to linger on that what do you how much do you curl i mean what are we talking about here that's all i do at the gym so i just i i my my routine you know on a good day i do about half an hour of cardio and i do about forty five minutes of weightlifting resistance training of some kind mostly weights i have a trainer who you know i love who pushes me which is really helpful you know he'll be i'll be like he'll say jeff do you see you could can we go up on that way a little bit and i'll think about it and i'll be like no i don't think so and he'll be he'll look at me and say yeah i think you can and of course he's right yeah of course so it's of course to have somebody push you a little bit but almost every day you do that i i do almost every day i do a little bit of cardio and a little bit of weight lifting and i'd rotate i do a pulling day and a pushing day and a leg day it's all pretty standard stuff so puttering coffee gym puttering coffee gym and then work work so what's work look like what what what are the productive hours look like for you i you know so i a couple years ago i left as the ceo of amazon alright and i have never worked harder in my life so i'm like i am i am working so hard and i'm mostly enjoying it but there are also some very painful days most of my time is spent on blue origin and i've been i'm so deeply involved here now for the last couple of years and in the big i love it in the small there's all the frustrations that come along with everything you know we're trying to get to rate manufacturing as we talked about that's super important we'll get there we just hired a new ceo a guy i've known for close to fifteen years now a guy named dave lampu i love he's amazing you know so we're super lucky to have dave and you know we're gonna you're you're gonna see us move faster there but so by day of work you know reading documents having meetings sometimes in person sometimes over zoom depends on where i am it's all about you know the technology it's about the organization it's about you know i'm very i've i have architecture and technology meetings almost every day on various subsystems inside the vehicle inside the engines it's super fun for me my favorite part of it is the technology my least favorite part of it is you know building organizations and so on that's important but it's also my least favorite part so you know that's why they call it work you don't always get to do what you wanna do how do you achieve time where you can focus and truly think through problems i do little thinking retreats so for this is not the only i i can do that all day long i'm very good at focusing i'm very good at you know i'm i don't keep to a strict schedule like my meetings often go longer than i plan for them to because i believe in wandering i let my perfect meeting starts with a crisp document so the document should be written with such clarity that it's like angels singing from on high i like a crisp document and a messy meeting and so the meeting is about like asking questions that nobody knows the answer to and and and and trying to like wander your way to a solution and because like and and that is if when that happens just right it makes all the other meetings worthwhile it feels good it has it has a kind of beauty to it it has an aesthetic beauty to it and and you get real breakthroughs in meetings like that can you actually describe the the crisp document like this is one of the legendary aspects of amazon of the way you approach meetings is this the six page memo maybe first describe the process of of running a meeting with memos and meetings at amazon and blue origin are unusual when we when we get new when new people come in like a new executive joins they're a little taken aback sometimes because a typical meeting will start with a six page narratively structured memo mhmm and we do study hall we for thirty minutes we sit there silently together in the meeting and read i love this notes in the margins and then we then we discuss and the reason by the way we do you could say i would like everybody to read these memos in advance but the problem is people don't have time to do that and they end up coming to the meeting having only skimmed the memo or maybe not read it at all and they're trying to catch up and they're also bluffing like they were in college having pretended to do the reading yeah exactly it's better just to carve out the time for people and do it yeah all on the same page we've all read the memo and now we can have a really elevated discussion and this is so much better from having a slideshow presentation you know a powerpoint presentation of some kind where there that has so many difficulties but one of the problems is powerpoint is really designed to persuade it's kind of a sales tool and internally the last thing you wanna do is sell you wanna you're again you're truth seeking you're trying to find truth and the other problem with powerpoint is it's easy for the author and hard for the audience mhmm and a memo is the opposite it's hard to write a six page memo a good six page memo might take two weeks to write you have to write it you have to rewrite it you have to edit it you have to talk to people about it they have to poke holes in it for you you write it again it might take two weeks so the author it's really a very difficult job but for the audience it's much better so you can read a half hour and you know there are little problems with powerpoint presentations too you know senior executives interrupt with questions halfway through the presentation that a question's gonna be answered on the next slide but you never got there if you read the whole memo in advance you you know i often write lots of questions that i have in the margins of these memos and then i go cross them all out because by the time i get to the end of the memo they've been answered that's why i save all that time you also get you know if the person is preparing the memo we talked earlier about you know groupthink and you know the fact that i go last in meetings and that you don't want you know to your ideas to kind of pollute the meeting prematurely you know the author of the memo is is is has kind of got to be very vulnerable they gotta put all their thoughts out there and they've got to go first but that's great because it makes them really good and so and you get to see their real ideas and you're not trampling on them accidentally in a big you know powerpoint presentation what's that feel like when you've authored a thing and then you're sitting there and everybody's reading your thing you you're like i think it's mostly terrifying yeah like maybe in a good way i think it's like a terrifying i think it's terrifying in a in a productive way yeah but i i think it's emotionally a very nerve wracking experience is there art science to the writing of the six page memo or just writing in general to you the i mean it's really got to be a real memo so it means you know paragraphs have topic sentences it's verbs and nouns you can't that's the other problem with powerpoint because they're often just bullet points mhmm and you can you can hide a lot of sloppy thinking behind bullet points when you have to write in complete sentences with narrative structure it's really hard to hide sloppy thinking so it does it it forces the author to be at their best and so you're getting somebody's they're getting somebody's really their best thinking and then you don't have to spend a lot of time trying to tease that thinking out of the person you've got it from the very beginning so it really saves you time in the long run so that part is crisp and then the rest is messy crisp documents so you don't want you don't wanna pretend that the discussion should be crisp yeah there's you know most meetings you're trying to solve a really hard problem there's a different kind of meeting which we call weekly business reviews or business reviews they may be weekly or monthly or daily whatever they are but these business review meetings that's usually for incremental improvement and you're look looking at a series of metrics every time it's the same metrics those we need to be very efficient they can start on time and end on time so we're about to run out of time which is a good time to ask about the ten thousand year clock it's funny yes that's what i'm known for is the humor okay can you explain what the ten thousand year clock is ten thousand year clock is a physical clock mhmm of monumental scale it's about five hundred feet tall it's inside a mountain in west texas yes in a chamber that's about twelve feet in diameter and five hundred feet tall ten thousand year clock is a idea conceived by a brilliant guy named danny hillis way back in the eighties the idea is to build a clock as a symbol for long term thinking and you can kind of just very conceptually think of the ten thousand year clock as it it you know it ticks once a year mhmm it chimes once you know every hundred years and the cuckoo comes out once every thousand years so it just sort of slows everything down and it's a completely mechanical clock it is designed to last ten thousand years with no human intervention so the material choices and everything else it's in a remote location both to protect it but also so that visitors have to kind of make a a pilgrimage the idea is that over time this will take hundreds of years but over time it will take on the patina of age and then it will become a symbol for long term thinking that will actually hopefully get humans to extend their thinking horizons and my view that's really important as we have become as a species as a civilization more powerful you know we're really affecting the planet now we're really affecting each other we have weapons of mass destruction we have all kinds of things where we can really hurt ourselves and the problems we create can be so large you know the unintended consequences of some of our actions so like climate change putting carbon in the atmosphere is a perfect example that's an unintended consequence of the industrial revolution there are a lot of benefits from it but we've also got this side effect that is very detrimental we need to be we need to start training ourselves to think longer term long term thinking is a giant lever you can literally solve problems if you think long term that are impossible to solve if you think short term and we aren't really good at thinking long term as you know it's not really you were kind of you know five years is a tough time frame for most institutions to think past and we probably need to stretch that to ten years and fifteen years and twenty years and twenty five years and we'd do a better job for our children or our grandchildren if we could stretch those thinking horizons and so the clock is in a way it's an art project it's a symbol and it if it ever has any power to influence people to think longer term that won't happen for hundreds of years but we have to you know we're gonna build it now and let it accrue the patina of age do you think humans will be here when the clock runs out here on earth i think so but you know the united states won't exist like whole civilizations rise and fall ten thousand years is so long like no nation state has ever survived for anywhere close to ten thousand years and the increasing rate of progress makes that even even less likely so do i think humans will be here yes what you know how will we have changed ourselves and what will we be and so on and so on i i don't know but i think we'll be here on that grand scale a human life feels tiny do you ponder your own mortality are you afraid of death no i'm you know i i used to be afraid of death i did i like my like i remember as a young person being kind of like very scared of mortality like you didn't wanna think about it and so on and always had a big and as i've gotten older i'm fifty nine now as i've gotten older somehow that fear has sort of gone away i don't you know i'd i'm i would like to stay alive for as long as possible but i'd like to be it's i'm really more focused on health span i wanna be healthy i want that square wave i wanna you know this i wanna be healthy healthy healthy and then gone i don't want the long decay but and i'm curious i wanna see how things turn out you know i'd like to be here i love my my family and my close friends and i wanna i'm curious about them and i wanna see so i have a lot of reasons to stay around but it's mortality doesn't doesn't have that effect on me that it did you know maybe when i was in my twenties well jeff thank you for creating amazon one of the most incredible companies in history and thank you for trying your best to make humans a multiplanetary species expanding out into our solar system maybe
