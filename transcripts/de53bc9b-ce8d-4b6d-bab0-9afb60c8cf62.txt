the following is a conversation with dennis white nuclear physicist at mit and the director of the mit plasma science and fusion center and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this podcast we got rocket money for helping you cancel unwanted subscriptions master class for online education and insight tracker for bio monitoring choose wisely my friends and now onto the full ad rates as always no ads in the middle i try to make this interesting but if you skip them please still check out our sponsors i enjoy their stuff maybe you will too this show is brought to you by rocket money a personal finance app that finds and cancels unwanted subscriptions monitors your spending and helps you lower your bills all in one place i use it especially to monitor my subscriptions it actually in a indirect way makes me realize all the things i'm subscribed to that actually add value to my life for example it shows audible and netflix maybe spotify i'm trying to think things i pay for every single month and things that add a huge amount of value to my life and in that list there are a bunch of subscriptions that i don't need that i completely forgot or actually i aspired to use but i end up not using and then you kinda have to confront yourself with the reality of the fact that you plan to use a service and you don't use it and why pay a huge amount of money every month every year to use it and so it's really nice to kinda have an introspective analysis of your life reflect and start anew i'm a big believer that habits every single day can make a huge amount of progress in your growth in your learning in your development in that same way paying for stuff every single day every week every month can make a huge impact in your bank account so that's why you wanna remove the stuff you're actually not using of course rocket money helps you manage other kinds of spending in general but for me the subscription is a big one go to rocket money dot com slash lex to cancel unwanted subscriptions and manage your money the easy way that's rocket money dot com slash lex this show is also brought to you by masterclass a hundred and eighty dollars a year gets you an all access pass to watch courses from the best people in the world in their respective disciplines the list is ridiculous chris hadfield will wright carlos santana garry kasparov daniel negreanu neil gaiman martin scorsese i would love to talk to martin scorsese on this podcast i think he's probably if not the he's one of the greatest directors of all time but also just a really interesting mind a really unique mind a really unique cinematographer director producer storyteller visionary has created some of the greatest movies ever but i think a podcast is a totally different thing than a masterclass a masterclass is a really condensed elegant clear succinct summary of all the deep lessons that the person has about the particular expertise and that's the kind of people you wanna learn about a thing from is the best people that actually have done it not just good at teaching but good at doing the best teachers are the ones that have reached the top and have sort of done it for long enough to be able to reflect on it and condense it down into wisdom and that's what master class is really good at you can get unlimited access to every masterclass and get fifteen percent off an annual membership at masterclass dot com slash lex this show is also brought to you by insidetracker a service i use to track biological data they have a bunch of plans most include blood tests that give you information to make decisions about your health like john mayer said your body is a wonderland it's a source of a lot of signal a lot of data it's obvious to me that in the twenty first century maybe the twenty second century we're going to create systems for the collection of that data and then use machine learning to analyze that data in order to understand what is going on inside of what you should do next that means recommendations about lifestyle about health about everything career advice relationship advice yeah you should get blood data that then help you understand what your dating life should be like this is obviously the future and then also if you can get data from the brain the the electrical the mechanical the chemical signals from the brain high resolution regular collection of that data all inside an app and make predictions based on that and what you should do with your life because otherwise just like i am right now you would be deeply lost deeply lost in the turmoil of the human condition services like insidetracker can at least give you a little bit of hope get special savings for a limited time when you go to inside tracker dot com slash alex this is a lex fridman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's dennis white let's start with a big question what is nuclear fusion it's the underlying process that powers the universe so as the name implies it fuses together or brings together two different elements technically nuclei that come together and if you can push them together close enough that you can trigger essentially a reaction what happens is that the the element typically changes so this means that you change from one element to know the chemical element to another underlying what this means is that you change the nuclear structure this rearrangement through equals mc squared releases large amounts of energy so fusion is the fusing together of lighter elements into heavier elements and when you go through it you say oh look so here were the initial elements typically hydrogen and they had a particular mass rest mass which means just the mass with no kinetic energy and when you look at the product afterwards it has less rest mass and so you go well how is that possible because you have to keep mass but mass and energy are the same thing which which is what e equals mc squared means and the the conversion of this comes into kinetic energy namely energy that you can use in some way and that's what happens in the center of stars so fusion is literally the reason life is is viable in the universe so fusion is happening in our sun and what are the elements the elements are hydrogen that are coming together it goes through a process which is probably gets a little bit too detailed but there's it's a somewhat complex catalyzed process that happens in in center of stars but in the end stars are big balls of hydrogen which is the lightest that's the simplest element the lightest element the most abundant element most of the universe is hydrogen and it's essentially a sequence through which these processes occur that you end up with helium so those are the primary things and the reason for this is because helium has features as a nucleus like the interior part of of the atom that is extremely stable and the reason for this is helium has two protons and two neutrons these are the things that make up nuclei that make up all of us along with electrons and because it has two pairs it's extremely stable and for this reason it when you convert the hydrogen into helium it just wants to stay helium and it wants to release kinetic energy so stars are basically conversion engines of hydrogen into helium and i mean this also tells you why you love fusion i mean because our our sun will last you know ten billion years approximately that that's how long the fuel will last but to do that kind of conversion you have to have extremely high temperatures it is one of the criteria for doing this but it's the easiest one to understand why is this it's because effectively what this requires is that these hydrogen ions or which is really the bare nucleus so they have a positive charge everything has a positive charge of those ones is that to get them to to trigger this reaction they must approach within distances which are like the size of the nucleus itself because the nature in fact what it's really using is something called the strong nuclear force there's four fundamental forces in the universe this is the strongest one but it has a strange property is that it while it's the strongest force by far it only has impact over distances which are the size of a nucleus so to get let's just put that into what does that mean it's a millionth of a billionth of a meter okay incredibly small distances but because the distances are small and the particles have charge they want to push strongly apart namely they have repulsion that wants to push them apart so in terms of when when you go through the math of this the average velocity or energy of the particles must be very high to have any significant probability of the reactions happening and so the center of our sun is at about twenty million degrees celsius and on earth this means it's one of the first things we teach you know entering graduate students you can do a quick you can do a quick basically power balance and you can you can determine that on earth that it requires a minimum temperature of about fifty million degrees celsius on earth to perform fusion to get enough fusion that you would be able to make get energy gain out of it so you can trigger fusion reactions at lower energy but they they become almost vanishingly small at lower temperatures than that first of all let me just link around some crazy ideas so one the strong force just stepping out and looking at all the physics is it weird to you that there's these forces and they're very particular like it operates at a very small distance and then gravity operates at a very large distance and and they're all very specific and the standard model describes three of those forces extremely well and there's and missile's one of them yeah yeah this is one of them and it's just all kinda works out there's a a big part of you that's you know an engineer that used to step back and almost look at the philosophy of physics so it's interesting because as a scientist i see the universe through that lens of essentially the interesting things that we do are through the forces that are get used around those and everything works because of that richard feynman had i don't know if you've ever had richard feynman it's a little bit of a tangent but he's never been on the podcast he's never been on the podcast he was unfortunately passed away but one of like a hero to almost all physicists and then part of it was because of what you said he kind of looked through a different lens at these what typically look like very dry like equations and relationships and he kind of i think he brought out the wonder of it in some sense right for for those he posited what would be if you could write down a single not even really a sentence but a single concept that was the most important thing scientifically that we that we knew about that in other words you had only one thing that you could transmit like a future or past generation it was very interesting it was so it's not what you think it wasn't like oh strong nuclear force or fusion or something like this and it's very profound which was he was that the reason that matter operates the way that it does is because all matter is made up of individual particles that interact each other through forces that was it so just the atomic theory basically yeah which is like wow that's like so simple but it's not so simple it's because like who thinks about atoms that they're made of like i i this is a good this is a good question i give to my students how many atoms are in your body like almost no students can answer this but to me that's like a fundamental thing yeah by the way it's about ten to the twenty eight ten to the twenty eight so that's you know trillion you know million trillion trillion or something like that yes yeah so one thing is to think about the number and the other is to start to really ponder the fact that it all holds together yeah it all holds together and you're actually that you're more that than you are anything else yes exactly yeah no i mean there are people who do study such things of the fact that if you look at the for example the ratios between those fundamental forces people have figured out oh if this ratio was different by some factor like a factor of two or something i was like oh this would all like not work mhmm and i look you look at the sun right it's like so it turns out that there are key reactions that if they had slightly lower probability no star would ever ignite mhmm and then life wouldn't be possible it does seem like the the universe yes set things up for us that it's possible to do some cool things but it's challenging so that that that keeps it fun for us yeah yeah that's the way i look at it i mean the you know the multiverse model is an interesting one because there are you know quantum scientists who look at and figure it's like oh it's like oh yeah like quantum science perhaps tells us that there are almost an infinite you know variety of other universes but the way that it works probably is it's almost like a form of natural selection it's like well the universes that didn't have the correct or interesting relationships between these forces nothing happens in them so almost by definition the fact that we're having this conversation means that we're in one of the interesting ones by default yeah one of the somewhat interesting but there's probably super interesting ones where we i i tend to think of humans as incredible creatures our brain is is an incredible computing device but i think we're also extremely cognitively limited i can imagine alien civilizations that are much much much much more intelligent in ways we can't even comprehend in terms of their ability to comp to construct models of the world and to do physics to do physics and mathematics i would see it in a slightly different way it's it's actually it's because we have we have we have creatures that live with us on the earth that have cognition right that understand and move through their environment but they they actually see things in a way or they sense things in a way which is so fundamentally different it's really hard like the it's it's the problem is the translation not necessarily intelligence so it's the perception of the world so i have a dog and when when i go and i see my dog like smelling things there's a realization that i have that he sees or senses the world in a way that i can never like i can't understand it because i can't translate my way to this we get little glimpses of this as humans though by the way because there are some parts of it for example optical information which comes from light is that now because we've developed the technology we can actually see things you know i've had i get this you know as of one of my areas of research is spectroscopy so this means the study of light you know and i and i get this quote unquote see things or representations of them from you know the far infrared all the way to like hard hard x rays which is several orders of magnitude of the of the light intensity but our own human eyes like see a teeny teeny little sliver of this yeah so that even like bees for example see a different place than we do so i i don't i i think if you think of there's already other intelligences like around us in a way in a limited way because of the way they can communicate but just like those are already in many ways yeah so if we just focus in on the senses there's already a lot of diversity but there's probably things we're not even considering as possibilities for example whatever the heck consciousness is could actually be a a door into understanding some physical phenomena we're not haven't even begun understanding so just like you said spectroscopy there could be a similar kind of spectrum for consciousness that we're just like we're like these dumb descendants of apes like walking around it sure feels like something to experience the color red but like we don't have it it's the same as in the ancient times you experienced physics you experience light yeah it's like oh it's bright and you know yeah yeah and you could start kind of semi frozen atmosphere tonight we might actually experience this faster than we thought because we might be building another another kind of intelligence yeah and that that intelligence will explain to us how silly we are there was an email thread going around the professors in my department already of so what is it going to look like to figure out if students have actually written their term papers or it's chat the the chat gpt chat gpt it was so as usual as in as we're we tend to be empiricists in my field so of course they were in there like trying to figure out if it could answer like questions for a qualifying exam to get into the phd program at mit which was they didn't do that well at that point but of course this is just the beginning of it so we have some interesting ones to go for eventually both the students and the professors will be replaced by cha gpt yeah and we'll sit on the beach i really recommend you know the i don't know if you've ever seen them it's called the day the universe changed this is is that a movie james burke yeah he's a science historian based in the uk he had a had a fairly famous series on on public television called connections i think it was but the one that i really enjoyed was the day the universe changed and the the reason for the title of it was that this is the universe is what we know and perceive of it so when there's a fundamental insight as to something new the universe for us changes of course the universe from an objective point of view is the same as it was before but for us it has changed so he walks through these these moments of perception in in in in the history of humanity that like changed what we were right and so as i was think thinking about coming to to discuss this you know people see fusion oh it's still far away or we've been it's been slow progress it's like when my when my godmother was born like people had no idea how stars worked so you talk about like that day that insight the universe change is like oh this is the i mean and they still didn't understand all the parts of it but you know they basically got it it was like oh because of the understanding of these processes it's like we unveiled the reason that there can be life in the universe that's probably one of those days the universe changed right yeah and that was around the nineteen thirties yeah it seems like technology is developing faster and faster and faster i tend to think just like with chat jpt i think this year might be extremely interesting just with how rapid mhmm and how profitable the efforts in artificial intelligence are that just stuff will happen where our whole world is transformed like this and we're there's a shock and then next day you kinda go on and you adjust immediately you probably won't have a similar kind of thing with nuclear fusion with energy because there's there's probably going to be an opening ceremony and stuff and now it's it'll take months but with the with digital technology you can just have a immediate transformation of society and then it'll be this gasp and then you kinda adjust like we always do and then you don't don't even remember just like with the internet and so on how the days were before and how did it work before right yeah i mean fusion will be because it's energy it's nature is that it will be and anything that has to do with energy use tends to be a slower transition but they're the most i would argue some of the most profound transitions that we make i mean the reason that we can live like this and sit in this building and have this podcast and people around the world is at its heart is energy use and it's intense energy use that came from the evolution of starting to use intense energies at the beginning of the industrial revolution up to now it's that it's like it's a bedrock actually of all of these but it doesn't tend to come overnight yeah and some of the most important some of the most amazing technologies one we don't notice because we take it for granted because it enables this whole thing yeah exactly which is energy which is amazing for how fundamental it is to our society and way of life is a very poorly understood concept actually just even energy itself people confuse energy sources with energy storage with energy transmission these are different physical phenomena which are very important for so for example you know you buy an electric car and you go oh good i have an emission free car and but it's like so so what why do you say that well it's because if i draw the circle around the car i have electricity and it doesn't emit any anything okay but you plug that into a grid where you follow that wire back there could be a coal power plant or a gas power plant at the end of that oh really i mean so this isn't like carbon free oh and it's not their fault it's just you know they don't like the car isn't a source of energy the underlying source of energy was the combustion of the fuel back somewhere yeah plus there's also a story of how the raw materials are mined yeah in which parts of the world with a sort of basic respect or or deep disrespect of human rights that happens in that money so the whole supply chain there's a story there that's deeper than just a particular electric car with a circle around it and the physics or the science of it too is the energy use that it takes to do that digging up which is also important and all that yeah anyway so yeah we wandered away from fusion but yes oh beautiful but it's but it's very important actually to in the in the context of this just because you know those of us who work in in fusion and these other kinds of sort of disruptive energy technologies it's it's interesting i do think about like what would it what is it going to mean to society to have an energy source that is like this that that would be like fusion you know which has which has such completely different characteristics for example you know free unlimited access to the fuel but it has technology implications so what does this mean geopolitically what does it mean for how we how we distribute wealth within our society it's it's very difficult to know but probably profound yeah we're gonna have to find another reason to start wars instead of resources we're gonna have we we've done a pretty good job of that over the the the course of our history yeah so we talked about the the forces of physics and again sticking to the philosophical before we get to the specific technical stuff e equals m c squared you mentioned how amazing is that to you that energy and mass are the same yeah and what does that have to do when you clear fusion so it has to do with everything we do it's the fact that energy and mass are equivalent to each other they're just the way we we usually comment to it is that they're just just energy just in different forms can you intuitively understand that yes but it takes a long time i haven't for a while but usually often i've i teach the the introductory class for incoming nuclear engineers and and so we put this up as an equation and we go through many iterations of using this to how you derive it how you use it and so forth and then usually in the final exam i would give i would basically take all the equations that i've used before and i flip it around i basically instead of thinking about energy is equal to to mass it's sort of mass is equal to energy and i asked the question a different way and usually about half the students don't get it it takes a while if to get that intuition yeah so so in the end it's interesting is that this is is actually the source of all free energy because that energy that we're talking about is kinetic energy if it can be transformed from mass so it turns out even even though we we used equals mc squared this is burning coal and and burning gas are and burning wood is actually still equals mc squared the problem is that you would never know this because the relative change in the mass is incredibly small by the way which comes back to fusion which is that e equals mc squared okay so what does this mean it tells you that the the amount of energy that is liberated in a particular reaction when you change mass has to because c squared is that's the speed of light squared it's a large number it's a very large number and it's totally constant everywhere in the universe which is a which is another weird thing which is another weird thing and then all rest frames and the the actually the relativity stuff gets more difficult conceptually when until you get through anyway so you go you go to that and and it's and what that tells you is that it's the relative it's the relative change in the mass will tell you about the relative amount of energy that's liberated and this is what makes fusion and you asked about fission as well too this is what makes them extraordinary it's because the relative change in the mass is very large as compared to what you get like in a chemical reaction in fact it's about it's about ten million times larger and that is at the heart of why you use something like fusion it's because that is a fundamental of nature like you can't beat that so whatever you do if you're thinking about and why do i care about this well because mass is like the fuel right so this means gathering the resources that it takes to gather a fuel to hold it together to deal with it the environmental impact it would have and fusion will always have twenty million times the amount of energy release per reaction that you get of those so this is why you know we consider it the ultimate like environmentally friendly energy source is because of that so is it is it correct to think of mass broadly as a kind of storage of energy yes you mentioned it's environmentally friendly so nuclear fusion is a source of energy it's cheap clean safe so easy access to fuel and virtual limited supply no production of greenhouse gases little radioactive waste produced allegedly mhmm can can you sort of elaborate why it's cheap clean and safe i'll start with the easiest one cheap it is not cheap yet because it hasn't been made at a commercial scale mine flies when you're having fun yes yeah yeah but yes not yet we'll talk about but actually we'll we'll we'll we'll come back to that because it it it this is cheaper or or a more technically correct term that it's economic that it's economically interesting is is really the primary challenge actually of fusion at this point but i think we can get back to that so what were the other ones you said so so cheap we're we're actually when we're talking about cheap we're thinking like asymptotically like if you take it forward yeah several hundred years that's sort of because of how much availability there is of resources to use of the fuel yeah of the fuel we should separate those two the fuel will all the fuel is already cheap it's basically free right what do you mean by basically free so if if we were to be using fusion fuel sources to power your and and it's like that's all we had was fusion power plants around and we were doing it the fuel cost per person or something like ten cents a year it's like it's free okay this is why it's hard to in some ways i think it's hard to understand fusion because people see this and go oh if the fuel is free this means the energy source is free because we're used to energy sources like this so we you know we spend resources and drill to get gas or oil or we chop wood or we make coal we find coal or these things alright so fusion this is what makes fusion and it's also it's not an intermittent renewable energy source like wind and solar so say but this is this makes it hard to understand so if you're saying the fuel is free why isn't the like why isn't the energy source free and it's because of the necessary technologies which must be applied to basically recreate the conditions which are in stars mhmm in the center of stars in fact so there's only one natural place in the universe that fusion fusion energy occurs that's in the center of stars so that's going to bring a price to it depending on the the cost and com sorry the size and complexity of of the technology that's needed to recreate those things and we'll talk about the details of yeah we'll get technologies and which parts might be expensive today and which parts might be expensive in two hundred years exactly it will have a revolution in it i'm i'm certain of it so about clean so clean is at its heart what it does is converts it basically converts hydrogen into it's it's it's heavier forms of hydrogen the one the most predominant one that we use on earth and converts it into helium and some other products but primarily helium is the product that's left behind so helium safe inert gas you know in fact that's actually what our sun is doing is eventually going to extinguish itself because it'll just make so much helium it doesn't it doesn't do that so in that sense clean because there's no there's no emissions of of carbon or pollutants that come directly from the combustion of the fuel itself and safe safe yeah we're talking about very high temperatures yeah yeah so this is also the counterintuitive thing so you you i told you temperatures which like fifty million degrees or it actually tends to be more like about a hundred million degrees is really what we aim for so how can a hundred million degrees be safe and it's safe because it is this is so much hotter than anything on earth where everything on earth is at around three hundred kelvin you know it's around a few tens of degrees celsius and what this means is that in order to get a medium to those temperatures you have to completely isolate it from anything to do with terrestrial environment it can have no contact like with anything on earth basically so this means what we this is the the technology that i just described is it fundamentally what it does is it takes this fuel and it isolates it from any terrestrial conditions so that it has no idea it's on earth it's not touching any object that that's at room temperature including the walls of the containment even including the walls of the containment building or containment device or even air or anything like this so so it's that part that makes it safe in this and and there's there's actually another aspect to it but that that fundamental part makes it so safe and in in the mainline's approach to fusion is also that it's very hot where there's very very few particles in at any time in in the thing that would be the power plant and the actually the more correct way to do it is you say there's very few particles per unit volume so in a cubic centimeter or in a cubic meter or something like that so we can do this so right now we're although we don't think of air really as a as there's atoms floating around us and there's a density because if i wave my hand i can feel the air pushing against my face that means we're in a fluid or a gas which is around us that has a particular number of atoms per cubic meter right so it's about this actually turns out to be ten to the twenty fifth so this is one with twenty five zeros behind it per cubic meter so we can figure out like cubic like cubic meters about like this yeah the volume of this table like the whole volume of this table okay very good so like fusion there's a few of those so fusion like the mainstream one of fusion like what we're working on at mit will have a hundred thousand times less particles per unit volume than that so this is very interesting because it's extraordinarily hot a hundred million degrees but it's very tenuous and what matters from the engineering and safety point of view is the amount of energy which is stored per unit volume because this tells you about the the scenarios that the and that's what you worry about because when those kinds of energies are released suddenly it's like what would be the consequences right so the consequences of this are essentially zero because that's less energy content than boiling water because of the low density because of the low density so if you take water is at about a hundred million to a billion times more dense than this so even though it's at much lower temperature it's actually still it has more energy content so for this reason you know one one of the ways that i explain this is that if you imagine a power plant that's like powering cambridge massachusetts like if you were to which you you wouldn't do this directly but if you went like this mhmm on it it actually extinguishes the fusion because it gets too cold immediately yeah so that's the other one and the other part is that it does not in the because it works by staying hot rather than a chain reaction it can't run out of control that's the other part of it so by the way this is what very much distinguishes it from fission it's not a process that can run away from you because it's it's basically thermally stable what does thermostable mean that means is that you want to run it at the optimization in temperature such that if it deviates away from that temperature the reactivity gets lower and and the reason for this is because it's hard to keep the reactivity going like it's a very hard fire to keep going basically oh so it doesn't it doesn't run away from you it can't run away how difficult is the control there to keep it at that it varies from from concept to concept but in generally it's fairly it's fairly easy to do that and the easiest thing it can't it can't physically run away from you because the other part of it is that there's just at any given time there's a very very small amount of fuel available to fuse anyway so this means that that's always intrinsically limited to this so even if the power consumption of the device goes up it just kind of burns itself out immediately yeah so you are the just to take a tan another tangent on a tangent you're the director of mit's plasma science infusion center we'll talk about maybe you can mention some interesting aspects of the history of the center in the broader history of mit and maybe broader history of science and engineering in the history of human civilization but also just the link on the safety aspect yeah you know how how do you prevent you know some some of the amazing reactors that you're designing how do you prevent from destroying all of human civilization in the process what what's the safety protocols fusion is interesting because it's not really directly weaponizable because what what i mean by that is that you have you have to work very hard to make these conditions at which you can get energy gain from from fusion and this means that the the when we design these devices with respect to application in the energy field is that they you know the while while while they will because they're producing large amounts of power and they will have hot things inside of them this means that they have like a level of industrial hazard which is very similar to what you would have like in a chemical processing plant or anything like that and any kind of energy plant actually has these as well too but the underlying under underneath the core technology like can't be directly used in in a nefarious way because of the power that's being emitted it just basically well if you try to do those things typically it just stops working so the safety concerns have to do with just regular things that like equipment malfunctioning melting of like all all this kind of stuff that yeah has nothing to do with fusion necessarily yeah i mean usually what we worry about is the viability because in the end we build pretty complex objects to realize these requirements and so what we try really hard to do is like not damage those components which but those are things which are internal to the to the fusion device and it's this is not something that you would consider about like it would as you say destroy human civilization because that release of energy is just inherently limited because of the fusion process so it doesn't say that there's zero so you asked about the other feature but that it's safe so it is the process itself is intrinsically safe but because it's a complex technology you still have to take into amount consideration aspects of the safety so it produces ionizing radiation instantaneously so you have to take care of this which means that you shield it think of like your dental x rays or or treatments for cancer and things like this we we always shield ourselves from this so we get the beneficial effects but we minimize the harmful effects of those so there there there are all those aspects of it as well too yeah so we'll return to mit's plasma science at future center but let us linger on the destruction of human civilization which brings us to the topic of nuclear fission what is that so the the process that is inside nuclear weapons and current nuclear power plants so it relies on the same underlying physical principle but it's exactly the opposite of which actually the names imply fusion means bringing things together fission means splitting things apart so fission requires the heaviest instead of the lightest and the most unstable versus the most stable elements so this tends to be uranium or plutonium primarily uranium so take uranium so uranium two thirty five is one of the that this is one of the heaviest unstable elements and what happens is that this is and fission is triggered by the fact that one of these subatomic particles the neutron which has no electric charge basically gets in proximity enough to this and and triggers an instability effectively inside of this what is teetering on the border of instability and basically splits it apart and that's the fission right the fissioning and so when that happens because the products that are in in kind of roughly splits in two but it's not even that it's actually more complex it splits into this whole array of lighter elements and nuclei and when that happens there's less rest mass left than the than the original one so it's actually the same so it's again it's rearrangement of the strong nuclear force that that's happening but that's the source of energy and so in the end it's like so this is a famous graph that we show everybody is is basically it turns out every element that exists in the periodic table all the things that make up everything have have a remember you asked a good question it was like so should we think of mass as being the same as stored energy yes so you can make a plot that basically shows the relative amount of stored energy in all of the elements that are stable and make up basically the world okay in the universe and it turns out that this one has a maximum amount of of stability or storage at iron so it's kind of in the middle of the periodic table because this goes from you know this is roughly that and so this what that means is that if if you take something heavier than iron like uranium which is which is more than twice as heavy than that and you split apart if somehow just magically you can just split apart its constituents and you get something that's lighter that will because it moves to a more stable energy state it releases kinetic energy that's the energy that we use kinetic energy meaning the movement of things so it's actually an energy you can do something with and fusion sits on the other side of that because it's also moving towards iron but it's do it has to do it through few fusion together so this leads to some pretty profound differences as i said they have some underlying physics or science proximity to each other but they're literally the opposite so fusion why is this it actually goes into practical implications of it which is that fission could happen at room temperature it's because there's this neutron has no electric charge and therefore it's literally room temperature neutrons that actually trigger the reaction so this means in order to establish what's going on with it and it works by chain reaction is that you can do this at room temperature so enrico fermi did this like on a on a university campus university of chicago campus the first sustained you know chain reaction was done underneath a squash court with the big blocks of graphite you know it was still don't get me wrong an incredible human achievement right but that's you know and then you think about fusion i have to build a contraption of some kind that's going to get to a hundred million degrees okay wow that's a big difference the other one is about the chain reaction that namely fission works by the fact that when that fission occurs it actually produces free neutrons free neutrons particularly if they get slowed down to room temperature trigger can trigger other fission reactions if there's other uranium nearby or fissile materials so this means that the way that it releases energy is that you set this up in a very careful way such that every on average every reaction that happens exactly releases enough neutrons and slows down that they actually make another reaction one exactly one and what this means is that because each reaction releases a fixed amount of energy you do this and then in time this looks like just a constant power output so that's how our fission power plan works and so either control the the chain reactions is extremely difficult and extremely important for it's very important fission and when you intentionally design it that it it creates more than one mhmm fission reaction per per starting reaction then it exponentiates away mhmm but which is which is what a nuclear weapon is yeah so how does an atomic weapon work how does a a hydrogen bomb work asking for a friend yeah yeah so at its heart what it what you do is you very quickly put together enough of these materials that can undergo fission with room temperature neutrons and you put them together fast enough that what happens is that this process can essentially grow mathematically like very fast and so this releases large amounts of energy so that's the underlying reason that it works so you've heard of a fusion weapon so this is interesting is that it is it but it's dislike fusion energy in the sense that what happens is that you're using fusion reactions to but it's simply it increases the gain actually of the weapon rather than it's it's not a pure at its heart it's still a fission weapon you're just using fusion reactions as a sort of intermediate catalyst basically to get even more energy out of it but it's not directly applicable to to be used in in energy source does it terrify you just again to step back at the philosophical that humans have been able to use physics and engineering to create such powerful weapons i wouldn't say terrify i mean we should be this is the this is the progress of of human every time that we've gotten access you talk again you know the day the universe changed those really changed when we got access to new kinds of energy sources but every time you get ax and typically what this meant was you get access to more intense energy right that's and that's what that was and so the ability to move from burning wood to using coal to using gasoline and petroleum and then finally to use this is that is that both the potency and the consequences are elevated around those things it's just like you said the the way that fusion nuclear fusion would change the world i don't think unless we think really deeply we'll be able to anticipate some of the things we can create there's going going to be a lot of amazing stuff yeah but then that amazing stuff is gonna enable more amazing stuff and more unfortunately or depending how you see on it more powerful weapons well yeah but see that's the thing fusion breaks that trend in the following way so one of them so fusion doesn't work on a chain reaction there's no chain reaction zero so this means it cannot physically exponentiate away on you because it works and actually this is why star by the way we know this already it's why stars are so stable why most stars and suns are so stable it's because they are regulated through their own temperature and their heating because what's happening is not that there's some probability of this exponentiating away is that the energy that's being released by fusion basically is keeping the fire hot and these tend to be you know and when it comes down to thermodynamics and things like this there's a reason for example it's pretty easy to keep a constant temperature like in an oven and things like this it's the same thing in fusion so this is actually one of the features that i would argue fusion breaks the breaks the trend of this is that it's it has more energy intensity than than than fission on on paper but it actually does not have the consequences of control and sort of rapid release of the energy because it's actually it it the physical system just doesn't want to do that yeah we're gonna have to look elsewhere for the weapons with which we fight world war three fair enough so what is plasma that you may or may have not mentioned you mentioned ions and electrons so what is plasma what is the role of plasma in nuclear fusion so plasma is a phase of matter or state of matter so unfortunately our schools don't it's like i'm not sure why this is the case but all children learn the three phases of matter right so and what does this mean so we'll take like water as an example so if you if it's cold it's ice it's in a solid phase right and then if you heat it up the temp it's the temperature that typically depends sets the phase although it's not it's not only temperature so you heat it up and you go to a liquid and obviously it changes its physical properties because it can you can pour it and so forth right and then if you heat this up enough it turns into a gas and a gas behaves differently because there's a very sudden change in the density actually that's what's what's happening so it changes by about a factor of ten thousand in density from the from the liquid phase into when you make it into steam at atmospheric pressure all very good except the problem is they forgot like what happens if you just keep elevating the temperature you don't wanna give kids ideas they're gonna start experimenting they're gonna start heating up the gas it's good to start doing anyway so you it turns out that once you get above it's approximately five or ten thousand degrees celsius then you hit a new phase of matter and actually that's the phase of matter that is for all pretty much all the temperatures that are above that as well too and so what does that mean so it actually changes phase so it's a different state of matter and the reason that it becomes a different state of matter is that it's hot enough that what happens is that the atoms that make up remember go back to feynman right everything's made up of these individual things these atoms but atoms can actually themselves be which are which are made of nuclei which contain the positive particles and the neutrons and then the electrons which are very very light very much less mass than than the nucleus and that surround us this is what makes up an atom so a plasma is what happens when you start pulling away enough of those electrons so that they're free from the ion so almost all the atoms that make up us up in this water and all that the electrons are in tightly bound states and basically they're extremely stable once you're at about five thousand or ten thousand degrees you start pulling off the electrons and what this means is that now the medium that is there its constituent particles have mostly have net charge on them so why does that matter it's because now this means that the particles can interact through their electric charge in some sense they were when it was in the atom as well too but now that they're free particles this means that they start it fundamentally changes the behavior it doesn't behave like a gas it doesn't behave like a solid or a liquid it behaves like a plasma right and so why is this why is it disappointing that we don't speak about this it's because ninety nine percent of the universe is in the plasma state it's called stars and in fact our own sun at the center of the sun is what clearly a plasma but actually the surface of the sun which is around fifty five hundred celsius is also a plasma because it's hot enough that is that in fact the things that you see sometimes you see these pictures from the surface of the sun amazing like satellite photographs of like those big arms of things and of light coming off of the surface of the sun and solar flares those are plasmas what are some interesting ways that this fourth state of matter is different than gas let's go to how a gas works right so the reason a and it goes back to feynman's brilliance in saying that this is the most important concept the reason actually solid liquid and gas phases work is because the the nature of the interaction between the atoms changes and so in a gas you can think of this as being this room and the things although you can't see them is that the molecules are flying around but then with some frequency they basically bounce into each other mhmm and when they bounce into each other they exchange momentum and energy around on this and so it turns out that the probability and the distances and the scattering of those of what they do it's it's those interactions that set the about how a gas behaves so what do you mean by this so for example if i take an imaginary test particle of some kind like i spray something into the air that's got a particular color in fact you can do it in liquids as well too like how it gradually will disperse away from you this is this is fundamentally set because of the way that those particles are bouncing in temperature probabilities of those particle bubbles the rate that they go at and the distance that they go at and so forth so this was figured out by einstein and others at the beginning of the brownian motion all these kinds of things these these were set up at the beginning of the last century and was really like this great revelation wow this is why matter behaves the way that it does like wow so but it's really like and and also in liquids and in solids like what really matters is is is is how you're interacting with your nearest neighbor so you think about that one the gas particles are basically going around until they until they actually hit into each other though they don't really exchange information and it's the same in a liquid you're kind of beside each other but you can kind of move around and in a solid you're literally like stuck beside your neighbor you can't move like yeah plasmas are are weird in the sense is that they're it's not like that so it is because the particles have electric charge this means that they can push against each other without actually being in close proximity to each other it's it's not that's not an infinitely true statement which goes get it's a little bit more technical but basically this means that you can start having action or exchange of information at a distance and that's in fact the definition of a plasma that it says these have a technical name is called a coulomb collisions this just means that it's dictated by this force which is being pushed between the charged particles is that the definition of a plasma is a is a medium in which the collective behavior is dominated by these collisions at a distance so you can imagine then this starts to to give you some strange behaviors which i could i could quickly talk about like freaks one of the most counterintuitive ones is as plasmas get more hot as they get higher in temperature then the collisions happen less frequently it's like like what that doesn't make any sense when particles go faster you you think they would collide more often but because the particles are interacting through interacting through their electric field when they're going faster they actually spend less time in the influential field of each other and so they talk to each other less in an energy and momentum exchange point of view interesting just just one of the count one of the counterintuitive aspects of plasmas which is probably very relevant for nuclear fusion yes exactly so if i can try to summarize what a nuclear fusion reactor is supposed to do so you have what a couple of elements what are usually the elements usually deuterium and tritium which are the heavy forms of hydrogen hydrogen you have those and you start heating it and then as you start heating it i forgot the temperature you said but about a hundred million yeah no first first it becomes oh first it becomes plasma so it's it's a gas and then it turns into a plasma at about ten thousand degrees and then so you have a bunch of electrons and ions flying around and then you keep heating the thing yeah and i guess as you heat the thing the ions hit each other rarer and rarer yes so oh man that's not fun so you have to keep yes heating it such that you you have to keep hitting it until the probability of them colliding becomes reasonably high and so if you're also on top of that and sorry to interrupt you have to prevent them from hitting the walls exactly of the reactor exactly somehow so you asked about the the the definitions of the requirements for fusion so the most famous one or some sense the most intuitive one is the temperature and the reason for that is that you you can make many many kinds of plasmas that have zero fusion going on in them and the reason for this is that the average so you can make a plasma at around ten thousand in fact if you come by the way you're welcome to come to our laboratory at the psfc i can show you a demonstration of a plasma mhmm that you can see with your eyes and it's at about ten thousand degrees and you can put your hand up beside it and all this and it's like and nothing there's zero fusion going on so you have sorry what was the temperature of the plasma about ten thousand degrees you can stick your hand in well you can't stick your hand into it but there's a glass tube you can basically see this see if you're right yeah and you can put your hand on the glass tube because it's what's the color is it purple it's it's purple yeah a little purple it's beautiful it is it is kind of beautiful yeah plasmas are actually quite astonishing sometimes in their beauty actually one of the most amazing forms of plasma is lightning by the way which is instantaneous form of plasma that exists on earth but immediately goes away because everything else around it is at room temperature that's fascinating yeah so there's different requirements in this so making a plasma takes about this but at ten thousand degrees even at a million degrees there's almost no probability of the fusion reactions occurring and this is because while the the charged particles can hit into each other if you go back to the very beginning of this remember i said oh these charged particles have to get to within distances which are like this size of a nucleus because of the strong nuclear force well unfortunately as the particles get closer this the repulsion that comes from the charge the coulomb force increases like the inverse distance squared oh no so as they get closer they're pushing harder and harder apart so then then it gets a little bit more exotic which you maybe you'll like though that it turns out that you people understood this in the at the beginning of the of of the age of after rutherford discovered the nucleus it's like oh yeah i was like how are we going to how is this gonna work right because how do you get anything within these distances enquire extraordinary energy and it does and in fact when you look at those energies they're very very high but it turns out quantum physics comes to the rescue because the particles aren't aren't actually just particles they're also waves this is the point of quantum right the you can treat them both as waves and as as particles and it turns out if you get if they get in close enough proximity to each other then the particle pops through basically this energy barrier through an effect called quantum tunneling which is really just the transposition of the fact that it's a wave so that it has a finite probability of this it's by the way you talk about like do you have a hard time like conceptualizing this these are this is one of them quantum tons is one of them yeah this is like throwing a ping pong ball like at a a piece of paper and then every like you know one hundred of them just like magically show up on the other side of the paper without seemingly breaking the paper i mean to use a physical analogy and that that phenomena is import is is critical for the function of nuclear fusion yes for for all kinds of fusion so this this is the reason why stars can work as well too like the stars would have to be much much hotter actually to be able to in fact it's not clear that they would actually ignite in fact with without this effect anyway so we get to that so this is why there's another requirement it's it's not so you must make a plasma but you also also must get it very hot in order for the reactions to have a significant probability to actually fuse mhmm and it actually falls effectively almost to zero for lower temperatures as well too and so there there's some nice equation yes that gets you to fifty million degrees or like yeah the the or that you said practically speaking a hundred million so it's a really simple equation it's the ideal gas law basically almost though in the end you've got a certain number of particle of these fusion particles in the plasma state they're in the plasma state there's a certain number of particles and if the confinement is perfect if you put in a certain content of energy then basically eventually they just they come up in a temperature and they become they they go up they go up to high temperature this turns out to be by the way extraordinarily small amounts of energy and you go what it's like i'm getting something to like a hundred million degrees that's gonna take the biggest flame burner that i've ever seen no and the reason for this is it goes back to the energy content of of this so yeah you have to there's you have to get it to high average energy but there's very very few particles there's low density it's low density low density in a in a reactor is this so you the way that you do this is primarily again this is not exactly true in all kinds of fusion but in the in the primary one that we work on magnetic fusion this is all happening in a hard vacuum so it's like it's happening in outer space so basically you've gotten rid of all the other particles except for these specialized particles so you add them one at a time no actually it's even easier than that you you connect a gas valve and you basically leak gas into it in a controlled fashion yeah yeah well this is beautiful how do you the gas cylinder how do you get it from hitting the walls yeah so now you've touched on the other necessary requirements so it turns out it's not just temperature that's required you must also confine it so what does this mean confine it and there's two types of confinement as you mentioned you mentioned the magnetic one magnetic one there's another one called inertial as well too but the general principle actually has nothing to do with in particular with what you what the technology is that you use to confine it it's because this goes back to the fact that the requirement in this is high temperature and thermal content so it's like building a fire right and what this means is that if you when you release the energy into this or or or apply heat to this if it just instantly leaks out it can never get hot right so you're familiar with this it's like you've got something that you're you're you're trying to apply heat to but you're just throwing the heat away very quickly this is why we insulate homes by the way and things like this right it's like like you don't want the heat that's coming into this room to just immediately leave because you'll just start consuming infinite amounts of heat to try to keep it hot so in the end this is one of the requirements and it actually has a name we call it the energy confinement time so this means if you release a certain amount of energy into this fuel kind of how long you sit there and you look at your watch how long does it take for this energy to like leave the system so you could imagine that in this room that you know these heaters are putting energy into the air in this room and you waited for a day would all the heat have gone to outside if i open up the windows oh there that's energy confinement time okay so it's the same concept as that so this is an important one so all fusion must have confinement there's another more esoteric reason for this which is that people often confuse temperature and energy so what do i mean by that so this is literally a temperature which means that it is a system in which all the particles every particle has high kinetic energy and is actually in a fully relaxed state namely that entropy has been maximized and it gets a little bit more technical but this means that basically it is it is a thermal system so it's like the air in this room is like the water it's the water in this these all have temperatures which means that there's a distribution of those energies because the particles have collided so much that it's there so we this is distinguished from having high energy particles like what we have in like particle accelerators like cern and so forth those are high kinetic energy but it's not a temperature so it actually doesn't count as confinement so we go through all of those you have temperature and then the other requirement not too surprising is actually that there has to be enough density of the fuel enough but not too much enough but not too much yes and so in the end the way that it there's a fancy name for it it's called the lawson criterion because it was it was it was formulated by scientists in the united kingdom about nineteen fifty six or nineteen fifty seven and this was essentially the realization of oh this is what it's going to take regardless of the confinement method these are this is the basic what it is actually power balances just says oh there's a certain amount of heat coming in which is coming from the fusion reaction itself because the fusion reaction heats the the fuel versus how fast you would lose it and it it basically summarize it's summarized by those three parameters which are fairly simple so temperature and then the reason we say a hundred million degrees is because almost all way in in for the for this kind of fusion deuterium tritium fusion the minimum in the density and the confinement time product is at about a hundred million so you almost always design your device around that minimum and then you try to get it contained well enough and you try to get enough density so you know so that temperature thing sounds crazy right that's what we've actually achieved in the laboratory like our experiment here at mit when it ran its optimum configuration it was at a hundred million degrees but it wasn't actually the the product of the density in the confinement time wasn't sufficient that we were at a place that we were getting high net energy gain but it was making fusion reactions so this is the sequence that you go through make a plasma then you get it hot enough and when you get it hot enough the fusion reactions start happening so rapidly that it's overcoming the the rate that which is leaking heat to the outside world and at some point it just becomes like a star like a sun and our own our our own sun and a star doesn't have anything plugged into it it's just keeping itself hot through its own fusion reactions in the end that's really close to what a fusion power plant would look like what does it visually look like does it does it look like like you said like purple plasma you know yeah actually it's it's invisible to the eye because it's so hot that it's basically emitting light in frequencies that we can't detect it's literal it's invisible in fact light goes through it visible light goes through it so easy that if you were to look at it what you would see in in our own particular configuration what we make is in the end is a donut shaped it's a vacuum vessel to keep the the air out of it and when you when you turn on the plasma it gets so hot that most of it just disappears in the visible spectrum you can't see anything and there's very very cold plasma which is between ten and a hundred thousand degrees which is out in the very periphery of it which is kind of so the very coal plasma is allowed to interact with the kind of has to interact with something eventually at the boundary of the vacuum vessel and this kind of makes a little halo around it and it glows this beautiful purple light basically and these are that's the that's the that's what we can sense in the human spectrum yeah i i remember reading on subreddit called shower thoughts which people should check out it's just fascinating philosophical ideas that strike you while you're in the shower and one of them was it's lucky that fire when it burns communicates that it's hot using visible light yeah otherwise humans would be screwed yeah i don't know if there's a deeper fond truth to that but nevertheless i did find it on shower thoughts subreddit actually i do have this goes off in a bit of you're right this is actually it's interesting because you know as a scientist you also think about evolutionary functions and how we got like why do we have the senses that we do it's an interesting question like why can bees see in the ultraviolet and we can't then you go well it's natural selection for some reason this wasn't really particularly important to us right why can't we see in the infrared and other things can't it's like it's a fascinating question right obviously there's some there's some advantage that you have there that isn't there and even color distinguishing right of something safe to ease not safe but whatever it would be i actually go back to this because it's something that i that i tell all of my my students when i'm teaching ionizing radiation and radiological safety whatever you say there's a cultural concern or that when people hear the word radiation like what does this mean it literally just means light is what it means right but it's light in different parts of the spectrum right and so it turns out besides the visible light that we can see here we are immersed in almost the totality of the electromagnetic spectrum there is visible light there's infrared light there is microwaves going around as that's how our cell phone works you can't it it's way past our detection capability but also higher energy ones which have to do with ultraviolet light how you get a sunburn and even x rays and things like this at small levels are continually being like from the concrete in the walls of this hotel there's x rays hitting our body continuously i can bring out a we can go down to the lab at mit can bring out a detector and show you every single room will have and have these by our body you mean the ten to the twenty eight atoms yeah the ten to the twenty eight atoms and they're coming in and they're interacting with those things and those particularly the ones where the light is at higher average energy per per light particle those are the ones that can possibly have an effect on human health so we we have it's interesting humans and all animals have evolved on earth where we're immersed in that all the time yeah there's natural sources of radiation all the time yet we have zero ability to detect it like zero yeah and our ability cognitive ability to filter it all out and not it would probably overwhelm us actually if we could see all of it but my main point is goes back to your thing about fire and and self protection if these ionized if ionizing radiation was such a critical aspect of the health of organisms on earth we would almost certainly have evolved methods to detect it and we have none and yes the physical world that's all around us is yes subscribe you're blowing my mind doctor dennis white okay let's so you have experience with magnetic confinement you have experience with inertial confinement most of your work has been in magnetic confinement yeah but let's sort of talk about the the the the sexy recent thing for for a bit of a time there's been a breakthrough in the news that laser based inertial confinement was used by doe's national ignition facility at the lawrence livermore national laboratory can you explain this breakthrough that happened in december yeah so it goes to the set of criteria that i talked about before about getting high energy gain so in the end what what are we after in fusion is that we we basically assemble this plasma fuel in some way and we provide it a starting amount of energy think of lighting the fire and what you want to do is get back like significant excess gain from the fact that the fusion is is making more is releasing the energy so it's it's like the equivalent of like we wanna have a match a small match light a fire and then the fire keeps us hot it's like this is very much like that so as i said we've we've made many of the and what do we mean by we it's like the fusion community has pursued aspects of this through a variety of different confinement methodologies is that the the key part about what happens what was the threshold we had never gotten over before was that if you only consider the plasma fuel not the not the total engineering system but just the plasma fuel itself we had not gotten to the point yet where basically the size of the match was was smaller than the amount of energy that we got from the future is there a good term for when the output is greater than the input yes yes it there is well there's several special definitions of this so one of them is that if you if you like in a fire if you light a match and you have it there and it's an amount of energy compared to what you're getting out of the fire we call this ignition mhmm which makes sense right this is like what this what our own sun is as well too so that that was not ignition in that sense as well too so what we call this is scientific what the one that we i just talked about which is for for some instance when i get enough fusion energy released compared to the size of the match we call this scientific breakeven breakeven breakeven and it's because you've gotten past the fact that this is unity now at this point what is fusion gain or as using the notation q from the paper overview of the spark talking about before talk yeah using just the same kind of technical actually so that so sorry the technical term is q capital q oh so people actually use q we actually use capital q or some days it's called q taken q sub p or something like this okay okay so this is which which means that which what it means is that it's in the plasma so all we're considering is is the energy balance or gain that comes from the plasma itself we're not considering the technologies which are around it which are providing the containment and so forth so why why the excitement and so well because for one reason it's a rather it's a rather simple threshold to get over to understand that you're getting more energy out from the fusion even the theoretical sense than you were from the you know from the starting match do you mean conceptually simple it's conceptually simple that you get past one that everyone under like when you're less than one that's much less interesting than getting past one because so there's a really big you start a new energy gain yeah to get past but it's it's really it really is a scientific threshold because what q p actually denotes is the relative amount of self heating that's happening in the in the plasma mhmm so what what i mean by this is that in the end in these systems for and what what you want is something that where the the relative amount of of heating which is keeping the fuel hot is dominated by from the fusion reactions themselves mhmm and and and so it becomes it's it's sort of like thinking like a bonfire is a lot more interesting physically than just holding a blowtorch to a wet log right there's a lot more dynamics it's a lot more self evolved and so forth and what we're excited as as scientists is that it's clear that the in that experiment that they actually got to a point where the fusion reactions themselves were actually altering the state of the plasma it's like wow i mean we'd seen it in glimpses before in magnetic confinement at relatively small levels but apparently it seems like in this experiment it's likely to be a dominant dominated by self heating that's a very important that's a very interesting so that makes it a self sustaining type of area it's more self sustaining it's more self referential system in a sense and it sort of self evolves in a way again it's not that it's going to evolve to a dangerous state it's just that we want to see what happens when when the fusion is the dominant heating source and we'll talk about that but you know there's also another element which is the inertial confinement laser based inertial confinement is kind of a little bit of an underdog i saw a lot of the broad nuclear fusion community has been focused on magnetic confinement can you explain just how laser based inertial confinement works so it says a hundred and ninety two laser beams were aligned on a deuterium tritium d t target smaller than a p yes this is like e b actually yeah throw b okay well you know it depends not all p's are made the same but this is like throwing a perfect strike in baseball from a pitch this is like a journalist wrote this i think this is like oh no it's not a journalist it's doe yeah yeah i could department of energy we we try to use all these analogies this is like throwing a perfect strike in baseball from a pitcher's mouth three hundred and fifty miles away from the plate there you go department of energy the united states department of energy wrote this okay sir can you explain interesting what the what the lasers what what what actually happens actually there's usually mass confusion about this so so what's going on in this form of it so the fuel is is is delivered in a discreet the fusion fuel the deuterium and tritium is in a discreet spherical it's more like a b b let's call it a b b so it's a small one and all the fuel that you're gonna try to to burn is basically there okay and it's about that size so what's hap so how are you going to get and it's at literally it's it's like at twenty degrees above absolute zero because the deuterium and tritium are kept in in a liquid and in solid state oh wow so the fuel is injected not as a gas but as a as a solid or it's actually and it's very and and in these particular experiments they can introduce one of these you know these targets once per day approximately something like that because it's very it's very it's a kind of amazing technology actually that i know some of the people that worked on this back in the is they actually make these things at a b b size of this frozen fuel it's actually at cryogenic temperatures and they're almost like smooth to the atom level i mean they're amazing pieces of technology so what you do in the end is think you what you have is a spherical assembly of this fuel like a ball and what what is the purpose of the lasers the purpose of the lasers is to provide optical energy to the very outside of this and what happens is the that energy is absorbed because it's it's it's in the solid phase of matter so it's absorbed really in the surface and then what happens is that when it's absorbed and of something called the ablator what does that mean it it means it goes instantly from the solid phase to the gas phase so it becomes like a rocket engine and but you hit it like very uniformly so all there's like rocket engines coming off this surface think of like an asteroid almost where there's like rockets coming off all this thing so what does that do what does a rocket do it actually pushes by by newton's laws right it pushes the other thing on the other side of it equal and opposite reaction it pushes it in so what it does is it that the the lasers actually don't heat this is what was confusing people think the lasers oh we're gonna get it to a hundred million degrees in fact you want the exact opposite of this what you want to do is get essentially a rocket going out like this and then what happens is that the sphere like and this is happening in a billionth of a second or or less actually this rapidly that that force like so rapidly compresses the fuel that what happens is that you're squeezing down on it and and and you know it's like what was the see bb too that's bad actually bb i should have started with a basketball basketball goes from like a basketball down to something like like this mhmm and then billionth of a second and when when that when that happens i mean scale that in your mind so when that happens and in this this comes from almost from classical physics so there's some quantum in it as well too but basically if you can do this like very uniformly and so called adiabatically like you're not actually heating the fuel what happens is that you get adiabatic compression such that the very center of this thing all of a sudden just spikes up in temperature because it's it's it's it's actually done so fast so why is it called inertial fusion it's because you're doing this on such fast time scales that the inertia of the hot fuel basically is still finite so it can't like push itself apart before the fusion happens oh wow so so how do you make it so how do you make it so fast this is why you use lasers because you're applying this energy in very very short periods of time like under a fraction of a billionth of a second and so basically that and then the force which is coming from this comes from the energy of the lasers which which is basically the rocket action which does the compression so is the force is the inward facing force is is that is that increasing the temperature no exponentially you wanna keep the fuel cold and then and just literally just ideally compress it and then in something which is at the very center of that compressed sphere because you've compressed it so rapidly the laws of physics basically require for it to increase in temperature so the effect is like if you know the thing so adiabatic cooling we're actually fairly familiar with if you take a spray can right and you push the button when it when it rapidly expands it cools this is the nature of a lot of cooling technology we use actually well the opposite is true that if you would take all of those particles and jam them together very fast back in they wanna heat up and that's what happens and then what happens is you you basically have this very cold compressed set of fusion fuel and at the center of this it goes to this hundred million degrees celsius and so if it gets to that hundred million degree celsius the fusion fuel starts to burn and when that fusion fuel starts to burn it wants to heat up the other cold fuel around it and and it just basically propagates out so fast that what you would do ideally you would actually burn in a fusion sense most of the fuel that's in the pellet so this was very exciting because what they had done was they it's clear that they propagated this they got this what they call a hot spot and in fact that this heating had propagated out into the fuel and that's the that's the science behind inertial fusion so the idea behind a reactor is based on this kind of inertial confinement is that you would what have a new bb every like ten times a second or something like that there's some kinda yeah so there's a incredible device that you kind of implied that kinda has to create one of those bbs that so you have to make the bbs very fast there's reports on this but about what what does it mean you know the starting point is can you make this gain so this was a scientific achievement primarily right and the rest is just engineering no no no the rest is incredibly complicated engineering well in fact there's still physics hurdles to overcome so so where does this come from and it's actually because if you want to make an energy source out of this this had a gain of around one point five that namely the fusion energy was approximately was one point five times the the laser input energy again this is a fairly significant threshold however from the from the science of what i just told you is that there's two fundamental efficiencies which come into it which really come from physics really one of them is hydrodynamic efficiency what i mean by this is that it's a rocket so this just has a fundamental efficiency built into it which comes out to orders of like ten percent so this means is that your your ability to do work on the system is just limited by that okay and then the other one is the efficiency of laser systems themselves which if their wall plug efficiency is ten percent you've done spectacularly well in fact the wall plug efficiency of the ones using that experiments are like more like one percent right so when you go through all of this the approximate you know place that you're ordering this is for for fusion power plant would be a gain of a hundred not one point five so you still you know and hopefully we see experiments that keep climbing up towards higher and higher gain but then the the whole fusion power plant is a totally different thing so it's not one it's not one b b and one laser pulse per day it's like ten time five or ten times per second like like that right so you're doing it there and then then then and then comes the other aspect so it's making the targets delivering them being able to repeatedly get them to burn and then we haven't even talked about like how do you then get the fusion energy out which is mainly because these things are basically micro you know implosions which are occurring so this energy is coming out to some medium on the outside that you've got to figure out how to extract the energy out of this thing how do you convert that energy to electricity so in the end you have to basically convert it into heat in some way so most of the what you in the end what fusion makes mostly is like high very energetic particles from the fusion reaction so you have to slow those down in some way and then make heat out of it so basically the conversion of the kinetic energy of the particles into heating some engineered material that's on the outside of this and that's from a physics perspective is a somewhat solved problem but from an engineering is is is still is still yeah it's it's physics i can draw the i can show you all the equations that tell you about how it slows down and converts kinetic energy into heat and then what that heat means you know you can write out like an ideal thermal cycle like a carnot cycle so the physics of that yeah great the integrated engineering of this is a whole other thing i'll ask you to maybe talk about the difference between inertial and magnetic but first we'll talk about magnetic but let me just linger on this breakthrough you know it's nice to have exciting things but in a deep human sense there's no competition in science and engineering we're all like you said we we're broad first of all we are a humanity altogether and you talk about this it's a bunch of countries collaborating it's it's really exciting there's a nuclear fusion community broadly yeah but then there's also mit there's colors and logos and it's exciting and there's a that you you have friends and colleagues here that that work extremely hard and done some incredible stuff is there some sort of how how do you feel seeing somebody else get a breakthrough in a using a different technology is that exciting is this does the competitive fire get all of the above i mean i mean the ignition you know i have so you know to you know just to to wave the wave the flag a little bit so mit was a central player in in this in this accomplishment interesting i would say it it showed our two some of our two best traits so one of them was that like how do you know that this happened this measurement right so one of the ways to do this is if i told you is that the in the dt fusion what actually the the product that comes out is helium mhmm we call an alpha but it's it's helium and a free neutron right so the neutron contains eighty percent of the fusion of the energy released by the fusion reaction and it also because it has lacked it lacks a charge it basically tends to just escape and go flying out so this is what we would use eventually for that's mostly what fusion energy would be but so what my my colleagues my scientific colleagues at at the plasma science infusion center built were extraordinary measurement tools of being able to see the exact details of not only the number of neutrons that were coming out but actually what energy that they're at and by looking at that that configuration it reveals enormous i'm not gonna i'm not gonna scoop them because they need to publish the paper but it it it reveals enormous amounts of scientific information about what's happening in that process that i just described so i mean and i have there you know i have colleagues there that have worked like for thirty years on this for that moment of course you're excited for them i mean and it's one of those like there is there is nothing it's hard to describe to people who aren't who haven't who it's like almost addicting to be a when you get to be at the forefront of research of anything like when you see like an actual discovery of some kind and you're looking at it particularly when you're the person who did it right and you go no human being has ever seen this or understood this it's like it's pretty thrilling right so even even in proxy it's it's incredibly thrilling to see this it's not i don't i don't know if it's rivalry or jealousy it's like i can tell you already fusion is really hard so anything that keeps pushing the needle forward is a good thing but we also have to be realistic about what it means you know to making a fusion energy system yeah that's the that's the and then but that's the fun yeah i mean these are the still the early steps you maybe you can say the early leaps yeah so let's talk about the magnetic confinement yeah what is how how does magnetic confinement work what's the tokamak yeah how does it all work so go back to that so why inertial confinement works on the same principle that a star works so like what is the confinement mechanism in the star is gravity mhmm because it's it's it's it's it's own inertia of the something the size of the sun basically pushes literally a force by gravity against the center so the center is is very very hot twenty million degrees and literally outside the sun it's essentially zero because it's vacuum of space how the hell does that do that it does that by and it's out of like why does it just leak all of its heat it doesn't leak its heat because it all is held together by the fact that it can't escape because of its own gravity so this is why the fusion happens in the center of the star like we think of the surface of the sun as being hot that's the coldest part of the star so of our own sun this is about in fifty five hundred degrees a beautiful symmetry by the way is like so how do we know all this because we can't of course see directly into the interior of the sun by knowing the volume and the temperature of the surface of the sun you know exactly how much power it's putting out and by this you you know that this is coming from fusion reactions occurring at exactly the same rate in the middle of of of the sun is it possible as a a small tangent to build an inertial confinement system like the sun is it possible to create a sun it is of course possible to make a sun otherwise you wouldn't have stars but it is not impossible on earth because for the simple reason that it takes the gravitational force is extremely weak and so it takes something like the size of a star to make fusion occur in the center well i i i didn't mean on earth i mean if you had to build like a second sun how'd you do it you can't there's not enough hydrogen around yeah so the the limiting factor is the the just the hydrogen yeah i mean the the forces that and energy that it takes to assemble that is just mind boggling alright so we would do that right to be continued yeah to be continued so what are we doing it with so in the one that i just described it's like you say so you have to replace this with some force which is better than that and so what i mean by that is it's it's stronger than that so what i talked about the laser fusion this is coming from the force which is enormous compared to gravity like like from the rocket action of pushing it together so in magnetic confinement we use another force of nature which is the electromagnetic force and that's very it's orders and orders of magnitude stronger than the gravitational force and the key force that matters here is that if you have a charged particle that namely it's a particle that has an electric net electric charge and it's in the proximity of a magnetic field then there is a force which is exerted on that particle so it's called the lorentz force for those who are keeping track so that is the force that we use to replace physical containment so in so this again confuse so how do you hold something at a hundred million degrees it's impossible in a physical container this is not like you know it's not this plastic bottle holding in this liquid or a gas chamber what you're doing is you're using you're immersing the fuel in a magnetic field that basically exerts a force at a distance this comes back again to again like why plazas are so strange it's the same thing here and and if it's immersed in this magnetic field you're not actually physically touching it but you're making a force go on to it so that's the and that's the inherent of of magnetic confinement and then magnetic confinement devices are like a tokamak are basically configurations which exploit the features of that magnetic containment there's several features to it one is that the stronger the strength of the magnetic field the stronger the force and for this reason is that if you increase the strength of magnetic fields this means that the containment because namely the force which you're pushing against it is more effective and the other feature is that there is no force so for those who remember magnetic fields what are these things they're they're also invisible but you know if you think of a permanent magnets or your fridge magnet there are there are field lines which we actually designate as arrows which are going around you sometimes see this in school when you have the you know the iron filings on a thing and you see the directions of the magnetic field lines or or when you use a compass right so that's telling you because we're living in an immersed magnetic field made by the earth which is at very low intensity magnetic where it's strong enough we can actually see what direction it's in so this is the arrow that the the magnetic field is pointing it's always pointing north and for us is that so an interesting feature of this force is that there is no force along the direction of the magnetic field there's only force in the directions orthogonal to the magnetic the of like our near atmosphere so the study of aurora borealis what's happening in the near atmosphere what happens when solar flares hit the magnetic in fact remember i said fusion is the reason that life is responsible in the universe well you could also argue so is magnetic confinement because the the charged particles which are being emitted from from the galaxy and from our own star would be very very damaging to on earth so we get two layers of protection one is the atmosphere itself but the other one is the magnetic field which just surrounds the earth and basically traps these charged particles so they can't get away away it's the same it's the same it's the same deal how do you create a strong magnetic field yeah so with a giant magnet giant magnet yeah so it's it's basically true engineering is not there's essentially there's essentially two ways to create a a magnet so one of them is that we're familiar with like fridge magnets and so forth these are so called permanent magnets and what it means is that within these the atoms arranged in a particular way that it produces the electrons basically arranged in a particular way that it produces a permanent magnetic field that is set by the material so those tend those have a fundamental limitation how strong they can be and they also tend to have this like circular shape i guess so we don't you we don't typically use those so what we use are so called electromagnets and what is this it's like so the other way to make a magnetic field also go back to your you know your elementary school physics or science class is that you take a a nail and you wrap a copper wire around it and connect it to a battery then it can pick up iron filings this is an electromagnet mhmm at its simplest what it is it's an electric current which is going in a in a pattern around and around and around and what this does is it produces a magnetic field which goes through it by the laws of electromagnetism so that's what an electric that's so that's how we make the magnetic field in these in in these configurations and the key there is that you it's not limited by the magnetic property of the material the magnetic field amplitude is set by the amount of the the geometry of this thing and the amount of electric current that you're putting through and the more electric electric current that you put through the more magnetic field that you get the closest one that people maybe see is one of my one of my favorite skits actually was super dave osborne on it's probably it's probably past years like in a show called bazaar super dave osborne which is a great comedian called he was a stunt man and one of his tricks was that he was he gets into a car and then one of those things in the junkyard comes down you know and picks up the car and then puts it into the into the crusher this is his stunt which is pretty hilarious anyway but that thing that picks him up like how does that work that's actually not a permanent magnet it's a it's an electromagnet and so you can turn by turning off and on the power supply it turns off and on the magnetic field so this means you can pick it up and then when you switch it off the magnetic field goes away and the car drops okay so that's that's what it looks like speaking of giant magnets mit and commonwealth fusion systems cfs built a very large high temperature superconducting electromagnet that was ramped up to a field strength of twenty tesla the most powerful magnetic field of its kind ever created down on earth because i enjoy this kind of thing can you please tell me about this magnet yeah sure oh it was it's fun yeah there's a lot to parse there so maybe we so we already explained an electromagnet which in general is what you do is you take electric current and you force it to to follow a pattern of some kind typically like a circular pattern around and around and around around it goes the more time the more current and the more times it goes around the stronger the magnetic field that you make and as i pointed out it's like really important in magnetic confinement because it is the the force that's produced by that magnet in fact technically it goes like the magnetic field squared because it's it's a pressure which is actually being exerted on the plasma to keep it contained just just so we know for magnetic confinement what is usually the geometry of the magnet what do we what are the geometry yeah so the geometry is typically that typically is what you do is you want to produce a magnetic field that loops back on itself mhmm and the reason for this was goes down to the nature of the force that i described which is that there's no there's no containment or force along the direction of the magnetic field so here's a magnetic field in fact what it what it's more technically or more graphically what it's doing is that when the when the plasma is here's plasma particles here here's a magnetic field what it does is it forces all those because of this the this lorentz force it makes all of those charged particles execute circular orbits around the magnetic field and they go around like this but they stream freely along the magnetic field line so this is why the nature of the containment is that if you can get that circle smaller and smaller it stays further away from earth temperature materials that's why the confinement gets better but the problem is is that because it free streams along so we just have a long straight magnetic field okay it'll just keep leaking out the ends like really fast so you get rid of the ends so you basically loop it back around so what these look like are typically donut shaped or more technically toroidal shaped but donut shaped things where this collection of magnetic fields loops back on itself and it also for reasons which are more complicated to explain basically it also twists it also twists slowly around in this direction as well too so that's what it looks like that's what the plasma looks like because that's what the fuel looks like so then this means is that the the electromagnets are configured in such a way that it produces the desired magnetic fields around this so they how precise does this have to be you were probably listening to our conversation with some of my colleagues yesterday mhmm so it's actually it's it depends on the configuration about how you're doing it the configuration of the plasma the configuration of the electromagnets and about how you're achieving this this requirement it it it's it's fairly precise but it doesn't have to be in particularly in something like a tokamak what we do is we produce planar coils which just mean they're flat and we situate them so if you think of a circle like this what does it produce if you put current through it it it produces a magnetic field which goes through the circle like this so if you align many of them like this this this this there's things online you can go see the picture you keep arranging these around in a circle itself this forces the magnetic field lines to basically just keep executing around like this so we tend to align that one tends to re well it requires good or good alignment it's not like insane alignment because you're you're actually exploiting the symmetry of the situation to to help it there's another kind of configuration of magnetic of this kind of magnetic confinement called a stellarator which is we have these names for historic reasons which which is different than a tokamak it's different than a tokamak but it actually works on the same physical principle that namely in the end it produces a plasma which loops in magnetic fields which loop back on themselves as well but in that in that case the totality basically the totality of the confining magnetic field is produced by external three-dimensional magnets so they're twisted and it turns out the precision of those is is is more stringent yeah so are are tokamaks by far more popular for research and development currently than stellar raters of the concepts which are there the tokamak is by far the most mature in terms of its breadth of performance and and thinking about how would it be applied in a fusion energy system and the history of this was that many in fact you you asked what if we go back to the history of the plasma fusion center the history of fusion is that people scientists had started to work on this in the nineteen fifties it was all hush-hush and you know cold war and all that kind of stuff and and it's like they realized holy cow this is like really hard like we actually don't really know like what we're doing in this because everything was at low temperatures they couldn't get confinement it was interesting and then they they they declassified it and this is one of the few places that the the west and the soviet union actually collaborated on was a science even during the cold war even during the middle of the cold war it was really and this actually perpetuates all the way till now for we we can talk about the the project that that is sort of captured in now but and and and the reason they declassified it was because like everything like kind of like sucked basically you know about trying to make this confinement in high temperature plasma and then the russians then the soviets right came along with this device called the tokamak which is a russian acronym which basically means magnetic coils arranged in the shape of a doughnut and and they said holy holy cow like everyone was stuck at like a meager like half a million degrees or half a million degrees which is like in fusion terms of zero basically and then they come along and they say oh we've actually achieved a temperature twenty times higher than everybody else and it's actually started to make fusion reactions and everyone just go oh you know no way it's just hype from this it's like there's no way because we we failed at this it's a great story in the history of fusion is that then but they insisted and said no look you can see this from our data it's like this thing is really hot and it seems to be working this is you know late 1960s and there was a there was a team that went from the united kingdom's fusion development lab and they brought this very fancy amazing new technology called a laser and they use this laser and they shot the laser beam like through the plasma and by looking at the scattered light that came from the they go that basically the scattered light gets more broadened in its spectrum if it gets hotter so you could you could exactly tell the temperature of this and even though you're not physically touching the plasma it's like holy cow you're right it is like it is ten million degrees and so this was one of those explosions of like everyone in the world then wanted to build a token back because it was clearly like wow this is like so far ahead of everything else that we tried before so that actually has a part of the the story to mit and the pliosulysis infusion center was why is there a strong fusion in a major fusion program at mit it was because we were host to the francis bitter magnet laboratory which is also the national high field magnet laboratory well you can see where this goes right from this you know we're kind of telling the stories backwards almost but you know the the the advent of a tokamak along with the fact that you could make very strong magnetic fields with the technology that had been developed at that laboratory that was the origins of sort of pushing together the physics of the of the plasma containment and the magnet technology and put them together in a way that i would say is you know a very typical mit success story right we don't do just just pure science or pure technology we sort of set up this intersection between them and there were several pioneers that of of my of the of people at mit like bruno coppi who's a professor in the physics department and ron parker who was a professor in electrical engineering and nuclear engineering it's like even the makeup of the people right has got this blends of science and engineering in them and that's actually was the origin of the plowasilis infusion center was was doing those things so anyway so back to this so why so yes tokamaks have been have achieved the highest in magnetic fusion by far like the the the the best amounts of these of these conditions that i talked about and in fact pushed right up to the point where they were near q p of one mhmm they just didn't quite get over one so can we actually just linger on the on the collaboration across different nations just maybe looking at the philosophical aspect of this even in in the cold war there's something hopeful to me besides the energy that these giant international projects are a really powerful way to ease some of the geopolitical tension even military conflict across nations there's a war in ukraine and russia there's a brewing tension and conflict with china mhmm just the world is still seeking military conflict cold or hot what can you say about sort of the lessons of the twentieth century in these giant projects in their ability to ease some of this tension so it's it's it's a great question so as i said there was a reason because it was so hard that was one of the reasons they they declassified it and actually they started working together in some sense on it as well too and i think it was really there was you know an heuristic or or altruistic aspect to this it's like this is something that could change you know the future of humanity and its nature and its relationship with energy isn't this something that we should work on together right and and and and that went along in those ones and in particularly that any kind of place where you can actually have an open exchange of of of people who are sort of at the intellectual frontiers of your society this is a good thing right of being able to collaborate i've i've had the i mean i've have had an amazing you know career i've worked with people from it's like hard to throw a dart at a country and on the map and and not hit a country of people that i've been able to work with how amazing is that and and even just getting small numbers of people to bridge the cultural and societal you know divides is a very important thing even when it's a very even a teeny fraction of the overall populations it can be held up as as an example of that but it's interesting that if you look at then that continued collaboration which continues to this day is that it was it this actually played a major role in fact in east west relations or like so soviet west relations is that back in the reagan gorbachev days which of course were interesting in themselves of all kinds of changes happening you know on both sides right and but still like a desire to you know push down the the stockpile of nuclear weapons and all that within that context there was a very fairly significant historic event that at one of the the the reagan gorbachev summits is that they had really they they didn't get there like they couldn't figure out how to bargain to the point of the of the of some some part of the treaty i can't even remember the details of it anymore but they needed some kind of a symbol almost to say but we're still gonna keep working you know towards something that's important for all of us what did they pick a fusion project and that was in the mid nineteen eighties and actually then after so they basically signed an agreement that they would move forward to like literally collaborate on a on a project whose idea would be to show large net energy gain in fusion's commercial viability and work together on that and very soon after that japan joined as did the european union and now that project it it evolved over a long period of time and had some interesting political ramifications to it but in the end this actually also had south korea india and china join as well too so you're talking about major a major fraction of and and now russia of course is at the soviet union and actually that coalition is holding together despite the obvious political you know turmoil that's going around on all those things and that's a project called iter which is in under construction in the south of france right now can you actually look at before we turn to the giant magnet and maybe even talk about sparc and the stuff going the all amazing stuff going on at mit what is iter what what is this international nuclear fusion mega project being built in this in the south of france so its scientific purpose is a worthy one that it's essentially in any fusion device the thing that you want to see is more and more relative amounts of self heating and this is something that had not been seen although although we have made fusion reactions and we'd seen small amounts of the self heating we never got to a dom this actually goes to this qp business okay the goal of iter and it shifted around a little bit historically but very you know fairly quickly became we want to get to a large amount of self heating so this is why it has a a its primary feature is to get to qp of around ten and through this this is a way to study this plasma that has more higher levels of self determination around on it but it also has another feature which was let's produce fusion power at a you know relevant scale and and actually they're linked together which actually makes sense when you think about is that because the fusion power is the heating source itself this means that they're linked together and so iter makes it is projected to make about five hundred million watts of fusion power so this is a significant amount like this is what you would use you know for powering cities so it's not just the research they're really it is the development of really trying to achieve scale here so self heating and scale yeah yes so this this meant then too is the the development of an industrial base that can actually produce the technologies like the electromagnets and so forth and to do it with it is a tokamak it is it is one of these yes but very interesting it also revealed limitations of of this as well too like what well it is it's interesting is that it is clearly a on paper and in fact and in practice as well too the world the you know and very different political systems and you call it you consider at least geopolitical or economic rivals or whatever you wanna use like working towards a common cause and and one that we all think is worthy is is very like okay that's very satisfying but it's also interesting to see the limitations of this it's because well you've got seven you know chefs in the kitchen so what is this what is this meant in terms of the speed of the project and the ability to to govern it and so forth it's just been a challenge honestly around this and this is i mean it's very hard technically what's what's occurring but when you also introduce such levels of i mean this isn't just me saying it there's like g o o reports from the us government and so this is it's hard to like steer all of this around and what that's tended to do is make it it's it's not the fastest decision making process you know my own personal view of it was it was it was interesting because you asked you you said about the magnet and commonwealth fusion systems it was i worked most of my career on iter because when i came into the field in the early nineteen nineties when i completed my phd and started to work this was one of the most like you can't imagine being more excited about something like we're going to change the world with this project we're gonna do these things and we just like pour like an entire generation and and afterwards as well too is just poured their imagination and their creativity about making this thing work very good but at at also at some point though when you know when it got to being another five years of delay or a decade of delay you start asking yourself well is this what i want to do right am i going to wait for for this so it was a part of me starting to ask questions with my students i was like is there another way that we can get to this extremely worthwhile goal that maybe maybe it's not that that maybe it's not that pathway and the other part that was clearly frustrating to me because i i'm an advocate of fusion you you asked me about was i you know i was like well it's laser fusion or inertial or inertial fusion or magnetic fusion i just want fusion energy okay because i think it's so important to the to the world is that but the the other thing if that's the case then why do we have only one attempt at it on the entire planet which was iter mhmm it's like that makes no sense to me right we should have multiple attempts at this with different levels of whatever you wanna think about it technical schedule scientific risk which are incorporated in them and that's gonna give us a better chance of actually getting to the goal line with that spirit you're leading mit's effort to design spark yeah a compact high field dt burning takamak how does it work what is it what's the motivation what's the design what are the ideas behind it yeah at its heart it's exactly the same concept as iter so it's basically a configuration of electromagnets it's arranged in the shape of a doughnut and within that we will do we would do the same thing that happens in all the other tokamaks and including an eater and in this one is that namely you put in gas make it into a plasma you heat it up it gets to about a hundred million degrees the differentiator in spark is that we use the actual deuterium tritium fuel and because of the access to very high magnetic fields it's in a very compact space it's very very small what do i mean by small so it's forty times smaller in volume than iter mhmm but it uses exactly the same physical principles so this comes from the high magnetic field so in the end like what is why does this matter what it does is it does those things and it should get to the point where it's producing over a hundred million watts of fusion power but remember it's forty times smaller so iter was five hundred megawatts technically our our design is around a hundred and fifty megawatts so it's only about a factor of three difference despite being forty times smaller and we see qp large order of ten or something like this at that at that at that state is very important scientifically because this is basically matches what iter is looking to do the plasma is dominated by its own heating that's very very important and it does that for about ten seconds and the reason it's for ten seconds is that in terms of that that basically allows everything to settle in terms of the fusion in the plasma equilibrium everything is nice and settled so you know you have seen the physical state at which you would expect a power plant to operate basically for for magnetic fusion like wow right but it's more than that and it's more than that it's because about who's building it and why and how it's being financed mhmm mhmm so that scientific pathway was made possible by the fact that we had access to a next generation of of magnet technology so to explain this real quick why do we call it you you you said it in the words a superconducting magnet what does this mean superconducting magnet means that the materials which are in the electromagnet have no electrical resistance mhmm therefore when the electric current is put into it the current goes around unimpeded mhmm so it could basically keep going around and around you know technically for infinity and what that mean or for eternity and what that means is that the when you energize these large electromagnets they're they're using basically zero electrical power to maintain them whereas if you would do this in a normal wire like copper you basically make an enormous toaster oven that's consuming enormous amounts of power and getting hot which is a problem that was the technical breakthrough that was realized by myself and at the time my students and postdocs and colleagues at at mit was that we we saw the advent of this new this new superconducting material which would allow us to access much higher magnetic fields it's basically a next generation of the technology and and it was quite disruptive to fusion but namely what it would allow that if we could if we could get to this point where we can make the round twenty tesla we knew by the rules of tokamaks that this is going to be is going to allow us to vastly shrink like the sizes of these devices so it wouldn't take although although it's a worthy goal it wouldn't take a seven nation international you know treaty basically to build it you could build it with a company in a university so same kind of design but not using the superconducting magnets yeah and if in fact if you look at it's like it's if you just expand the size of it they're like they look almost identical to each other because it's based on the and actually that comes for a reason by the way is that it also looks like a bigger version of the tokamak that we ran at mit for twenty years mhmm where we established the scientific benefits in fact of these higher magnetic fields so that's the pathway that we're on so we say so what does this mean the context is different because it was made because it's primarily being made by a private sector company spun out of mit mhmm because the way that it raised money and the purpose of the entity which is there is to make commercial fusion power plants not just to make a scientific experiment this is actually why we have it's why we have a partnership right is that our purpose at mit is not to commercialize directly but boy do we want to advance the technology and the science that comes along this and and that's the reason we're sort of doing it together so it's mit and commonwealth fusion systems yeah so what's what's interesting to say about financing and this seems like from a scientific perspective maybe not an interesting topic but it's perhaps an extremely interesting topic i mean you can just look at the tension between spacex and nasa for example yes it's just clear that there's different financing mechanisms that can actually significantly accelerate the development of science and engineering it's great that you brought that up we use several historic analogs and one of them is around spacex which is an appropriate one because space you know putting things into orbit has a just has a minimum size to it and integrated technological complexity and budget and things like this so you know our point when we were like talking about starting like a fusion commercialization you know company people look at you like like isn't this still really just a science experiment you know but our one of the things that we pointed to was spacex to say well tell me like twenty five years ago how many people would have voted that you know the the the leading entity on the planet to put things into orbit it's a private company people would have thought you were not so right it's like and what is interesting about spacex was that it it proved it's more than actually just financing it's really the purpose of the organization so the purpose of a and i'm i'm not against public finance or anything like that but the purpose of a public entity like like nasa correctly you know speaks to the political because the because the cost comes from the political you know assembly that is there and and i guess from us eventually as well too but its purpose wasn't about like making a commercial product it's about fundamental discovery and so forth which is all which is all really great it's like why did why did spacex it's interesting why did spacex succeed so well is because the idea was it's like the the focus that comes in the idea that you're going to relentlessly like reduce cost and increase efficiency is a drive that comes from the commercial aspect of it right and this also then changes the people in the teams which are doing as well too and in fact trickles throughout the whole thing because the purpose isn't while you're while you're advancing things like it's really good that we can put things in orbit a lot less more cheaply like it advances science which is an interesting synergy right you know it's the same thing that that that we think is gonna happen in fusion that namely these this is a bootstrap effect that actually that when you start to push yourself to think about near term commercialization it like allows the science to to to get in hand faster which then allows the commercialization to go faster and and up we go by the way we've seen this also in another again it's a you you have to watch out with with analogies because they only can go so far but like biotech is another one like you look at the human genome project which was it's sort of like it's it to me that's like the like mapping the human genome is like like that we can make net energy from fusion like it's one of those like in your drawer that you go this is a significant achievement by humanity right in this century and there's the human genome project fully government funded it's gonna take twenty twenty five years because we basically know the technology we're just gonna be really diligent keep going and then all of a sudden what comes along disruptive technology right you can sequence you you know shotgun sequencing and and computer you know recognition patterns and basically oh i can do this a hundred times faster like wow right and so so that's really the you know to me the the story about why we started why we launched comofusion systems was more than just about another source of funding which which it is a different source of funding because it comes it it's also a different purpose which is very important but there's also something about mechanism that creates culture so mhmm giving power to like a a young student ambitious student to have a tremendous impact on the progress of nuclear fusion creates a culture that actually makes progress more aggressively like like you've said when seven nations collaborate it gives more incentive to the bureaucracy to slow things down to kinda have let's have first have a discussion and certainly don't give voice to the young ambitious minds that are really pushing stuff forward yeah and there's something about like the private sector that rewards encourages inspires young minds to say in the most beautiful of ways f you to the to the it is it is a to the boss yeah just say like we'll make it faster we'll make it simpler we'll make it better we'll make it cheaper yeah and sometimes that brashness doesn't bear out you know that's an aspect that that you just take a different risk profile as well too but you're you're right it's this you know of the i mean it was interesting our our own trajectory at the at the fusion center was like we were pushed into this place by necessity as well too because i told you we have and we had operated for a long time a tokamak at at on the mit campus achieved these world records like a hundred million degree plasma and so i was like wow this is fantastic but you know somewhat ironically i have to say is that it was like oh but we're not this isn't the future of fusion anymore like we're not we're just gonna stop with small projects because it's too small right so we should need we need to really move on to these much bigger projects because that's really the future of fusion and so it was defunded and this basically put at risk like like we were going to essentially lose mit in the ecosystem really of fusion both from the research but also clearly important from the educational part of it so we you know we push back against this we got a lifeline we're able to go it was in this it was in this time scale that we basically came up with this idea it's like we should do this and in the end it was all of those that the people who were in the c level of the company were all literally students who got caught in that they were phd students at the time so you talk about enabling another generation it's like yeah there you go right so spark gave a lifeline a lifeline a fuel to the the the future center at mit that it continues but it's way more than that it was it wasn't just about like surviving for the sake of surviving it was like in the end for me it became like this i remember the moment we talk about these moments as a scientist and we were just like we were working so hard about figuring out like does this really will this really work like and is it's complex like does the magnet work does the interaction with the plasma work does all these things work and it was just a grind push push push push and i remember the moment because i was sitting in my office in in brookline and and and and there was just like i read like and i was in i don't know whatever the twenty or fortieth slide or something into it and it was sort of that moment like it just came together and i like i i got i couldn't even sit down because all it was just like my wife was like why are you walking around the apartment like like this like i just couldn't she i said it's going to work like it's going to work like holy cow that that moment of realization is like kind of amazing but it also brings the responsibility of making it work as well yeah how do you make it work so you you mean like that magic realization that you can have this this modern magnet technology and you can actually like why do we need to work with iter we can do it here yeah yeah but it's interesting that iter is that one one of one of the reasons that like that we started with a group of six of us at mit and then it's once we got some funding through the through the establishment of the company it became slightly larger mhmm but in the end we had a rather small team like this was like a team of you know order of like twenty to twenty five people design spark in like a like about two years right how does that happen well we're clever but you have to give iter its due here as well too that again this is an aspect always of the bootstrap up like i go back to the the human genome project so modern day genomics would not be possible without the underlying basis that came from setting that up it had to be there it had to be curiosity driven public program is the same with iter but we because we had the tools that were there to understand iter we also had the tools to understand spark so we we parlayed those in an extremely powerful way to be able to tell us about what was going to happen so these things are never simple right it's like people look at this go oh this means we should like should we really have a public based program about fusion or should we have it all in the private it's like no no the answer is neither way because in all these complex technologies you have to keep pushing on all the fronts to actually get it there so you know the natural question when people hear breakthrough with the with the inertial confinement with the magnetic confinement is so when will we have commercial yeah reactors power plants that are actually producing electricity what's your sense looking out into the future when when do you think you can envision a future where we have actual electricity coming from nuclear fusion partly driven by us but in other places as well too so there's the advent what's you know what's so different now than three or four years ago like we launched around four years ago what's so different now is is the advent of a very nascent but seemingly robust like commercial fusion you know endeavor so it's not just commonwealth fusion systems there's something like twenty plus you know companies but there's a sector now there's a sector they actually they actually have something called the fusion industry association which if your viewers wanna go see this this describes the different and they've got this plethora of approaches like i haven't even described all the approaches i've basically described the mainline approaches you know and they're all at varying degrees of technical and scientific maturity with very huge different you know balances between them but what they share is that because they're going out and finding getting funding from the private sector is that their stated goals are about getting fusion into place so that both it meets the investors' demands which are interesting right and the time skills of that but also it's like well there's gonna and why it's because it's easy there's gonna there's this enormous push driver about getting carbon free energy sources out into the market and whoever figures those out is going to be both very it's it's gonna be very important geopolitically but also economically as well too so it's a different kind of bat i guess or a different kind of gamble that you're taking with fusion but it's so disruptive that it's like there's there's essentially a class of investors and teams that are ready to go after it as well too so what do they share in this they typically share getting after fusion on a time scale so that could it have any relevance towards climate change battling climate change and i would say this is difficult but it's it's fairly easy because it's math so what you do is you actually go to some target like two thousand and fifty or two thousand and sixty something like this and say i wanna be blank percent of the of the world's market of electricity or something like that and you and we know historically what it takes to evolve and curve exponential type curve it's a straight line a log plot curve exponential type curve it's a straight line a log plot and like you look at wind solar fission they all follow the same thing so it's easy you take that curve and you go that slope and you work backwards and you go if you don't start in the early twenty thirties like it's not gonna have it's not gonna have a significant impact by that time so all of them share this idea and in fact it's not just the companies now the us federal government has a program that was started last year that said we should be looking to try to get like the first and what do we mean by like what does it mean to start that you've got something that's putting electricity on the grid a pilot what do you call it and if that can get started like in the early twenty thirties you know the idea of ramping it up you know makes sense it's math right yeah so that's the ambition then the question is and and actually this is different because the government program and that they vary around in this so for for example the united kingdom's government idea was to get the first one on by twenty forty and china has ambitions probably middle twenty thirties or maybe a little bit later and europe you know continental europe is is is a little bit i'm not exactly sure where it is but it's like later it's like twenty fifty or twenty sixty because it's mostly linked to the iter timeline as well too the fusion companies which makes sense it's like of course they've got the most aggressive timelines it's like we're gonna map the human genome faster as well too right so it's interesting the about where we are and i think you know my we're not all the way there but my intuition tells me we're probably gonna have a couple of cracks at it actually on that timeline so this is where we have to be careful though you say commercial fusion you know what does that mean commercial fusion to me means that you actually have a known quantity about what it costs what it costs to build and what it costs to operate the reliability of putting energy on the grid that's commercial fusion it's like so it turns out that that's not necessarily exactly the first fusion devices that put electricity on the grid because you got it there's a learning curve to get like better and better at it but that's probably i would suspect the biggest hurdle is to get to the first one the work i've done the work i continue to do with autonomous vehicles and semi autonomous vehicles there's an interesting parallel there where a bunch of companies announced a deadline for themselves in twenty twenty twenty one twenty two and only a small subset of those companies have actually really pushed that forward there's google with waymo or alphabet rather is and and then there's tesla with semi autonomous driving in their autopilot full self driving mode and those are different approaches so tesla is achieving much much higher scale but the sort of the quality of the drive is semi autonomous right i i i don't know if there's a metaphor and analogy here yep and then there's waymo that's focusing on very specific cities but achieving real full autonomy with actual passengers but the scale is much smaller so i wonder like just like you said there'll be these kinds of similar kind of really hard pushes absolutely so actually this is what i it's why i've encouraged about fusion so fusion's still hard let's let everyone be clear because of the science under underneath it of of achieving the right conditions for the plasma basically is a is a is a a yardstick that you have to put up against all of them what's encouraging that i see in this and it's actually what happens when you sort of let loose the creativity of this is maybe i'll go back to first principles so fusion is also a fairly strange so if you think about building a coal plant like burning wood and coal and gas is actually not that much different from each other because they're kind of about the same physical conditions and you get the fuel and you light it fusion is very remember i told you that there's this condition of the temperature which is kind of universal but if you take the density of the fuel between magnetic fusion and inertial fusion they're different by about a factor of ten billion mhmm so this and the density of fuel really matters that actually so does the and that this means energy confinement time is also different by a factor of ten billion as well too because it's the product of those two so one's really dense and short lived and the other one's really long lived and and and actually under dense as well too so what that means is that the way to to the the way to the to get the underlying physical state is so different among these different approaches what it lends itself to is does this mean that eventual commercial products will actually fill different needs in the energy system so it sort of goes to your comment about i have to suspect this it's it's because anything that is high-tech and is like in a really important thing in our economy tends to never find its way as one only one manifestation like look at transportation as well too we have scooters vespas you know overland trucks cars electric cars of course we have these because they meet different demands in it so what's interesting you know that i find fascinating now is that we have infusion it's going to look like that that probably there's the while the near term focuses on electricity production there might even be different kinds of markets that actually make sense in some places less in others it comes to trade offs because we haven't really talked about the engineering yet but engineering really matters like to the to the operation of the device and so it could be that that you know i suspect what we'll end up with is several different configurations which have different features which are trade offs in the energy market what do you see as the major engineering or general hurdles yeah that are in the way yeah so the first one is just the cost of building a single unit so fusion has and it's it's actually interesting you talked about the about the different models that you have so fusion has one of its interesting limitations is that it's very hard it almost at some point becomes physically impossible to actually make small power units like a kilowatt a thousand watts you know which is like a personal home like you know this is about a this is about a thousand watts or your personal use of energy of of electricity is about like a thousand watts this is basically impossible in in for a single you know unit to do this so like you're not gonna have a fusion like power plant like as your furnace in or your electric heater in your home and the reason for this comes from the fact that fusion relies on it being it's not just that it's very hot it says that the fusion power is the heating source to keep it hot so if mhmm if you if you get if you go too small it basically just cannot keep it hot that's so it's interesting is that this so this is one of the hard parts so this means that the individual units you know and it's it it varies from concept to concept but the the the national academy's report that came out last year sort of put the the benchmark as being like probably the minimum size looks like around fifty million watts of electricity which is like enough for like a mid like a small to you know midsize city actually so that is so that's sort of like a scale challenge and in fact it's one of the reasons why in commonwealth and in other private sector ones like we they try to push this down actually of trying to get to to these smaller units just because it reduces the cost of it then probably obviously it's i i would say it's an obvious one like achieving the fusion state itself and high gain is is a is a hard one but we already talked about what kind of hurdle what kind of challenge is that that that that's achieving the right temperature density and energy confinement time in the fuel itself in the plasma itself and so some of the so some of the the configurations which are being chosen have are actually have quite a ways to go in practice seeing those but what their their consideration is oh yes but by our particular configuration the engineering simplicity confers like an economic advantage even if we're behind in a in sort of in a science sense okay mhmm which is fine that's the this is also what you get when you get a an explosion in in the private sector you basically are distributing risks in different ways right which makes sense all of that good so what i would say is that the the next hurdle to to really overcome is is about making that electricity so like we need to see a unit or several units like put using fusion in some way to put a meaningful amount of energy on the grid because this starts giving us real answers as to like what this is going to look like the full end to end the full end to end thing so commonwealth's goal is that i'll i'll just comment to commonwealth because i'll take some you know some i guess some credit for this is that the the origins of commonwealth were in fact in examining that like we could see this new technology coming forward this this new super conducting material and the origins of our thought process were really around designing effectively the pilot plant or the commercial unit it's called arc which is actually the the step forward after sparc and that was the or of the origins of it so all the things that were other parts of the plant like sparc and the magnet were actually all informed totally by building something that's gonna put net electricity on the grid and the timing of that we still hope is actually the early twenty thirties so spark is the design of the tokamak and arc is the actual full intent thing it's like a thing that actually puts the energy on the grid so spark is named you know intentionally that it's like it's on for a short period of time and it doesn't have a it has yeah yeah you know it's the spark of the fusion you know revolution or something like that i guess we could call it yeah so those are those are so those are sort of the programmatic challenges of doing that and you know it's inter you asked about you talked about spacex so what has evolved even in in the last year or so was in fact in march of twenty twenty two the white house announced that it was going to start a program that kind of looks like a spacex analogy that namely wow we've got these things in the private sector we should leverage the private sector and the advantages of what they obtain but also with the things like this is gonna be hard and it's gonna it's it's gonna take quite a bit of financing so why don't we set up a program where we don't really get in the way of the private sector fusion companies but we help them finance these difficult things which is how spacex basically became successful through the cots program fantastic right and that's evolving as well too so like the the fusion ecosystem is almost unrecognizable from where it was like five years ago around those things how important is it for the heads of the companies that are working on nuclear fusion to have a twitter account and to be quite because you said you don't use twitter i don't use twitter very much i mean there there is some element to and i don't think this should be discounted whatever you think about figures like jeff bezos with blue origin or elon musk with spacex yeah there is a science communication yeah to put it in nice terms that's kind of required to really educate the public and get everybody excited and sell the sexiness of it i mean just even the videos of spacex just being able to kind of get everybody excited about going out to space once again i mean there's all kinds of different ways of doing that but part i mean i guess what's the companies do well you know is is to advertise themselves to really sell themselves it is yeah well actually it is it like i feel like why one of the reasons on on this podcast and so like i i don't have an official role in the company and one of the reasons for for this was also that it's interesting because when you come from like you're running a company it's it makes sense that they're promoting their own product and their own vision which totally makes sense but there's also a very important role for academics who have knowledge about what's going on but are sufficiently distant from it that they're not fully only self self motivated just by their own you know projects or so forth and for me this is i mean we we we see particularly the problems of the distrust in technology mhmm and then honestly in the scientific community as well too it will be the one of the greatest tragedies i would say that if we go through all of this and almost pull off what looks like a miracle like technologic and scientific wise which is to make a fusion power plant and then nobody wants to use it because they feel that they don't trust the people who are doing it or the technology so we have to get so far out ahead of this like so i give lots of public lectures or think things like this of of accessing a larger range of people we're not trying to hide anything you can come and see you know come do tours of our laboratory in fact i want to set those up virtually as well too you might look at our plasmosis infusion center youtube channel so we are reaching out through those meetings right and it's really important that we do those things but it's also and but also then realizing setting up the realistic expectations of what we need to do you know we're not there like we don't have commercial fusion devices yet and you ask like what are the challenges i'm not gonna get in into any deep technical you know questions about what the challenges are but it is it the pathway not just to make fusion work technically but to make it economically competitive and viable so that's actually used out in the private sector is a non trivial task and it's because of the newness of it like we're simultaneously trying to evolve the technology and make it economically viable at the same time those are two difficult couple tasks so my own my own research and my own drive right now is that fantastic commonwealth fusion systems is set up we have a commercialization unit of that particular kind which is gonna drive forward a token back in fact i was just there there's discussions or there's there's dialogues going on around the world with other kinds of ones like stellarators and so which prefer different kinds of challenges and economic advantages but what we have to i know what we have to have what we have to have is a new generation of integrated scientists technologists and engineers that understand like how what needs to get done to get all the way to the goal line mhmm because we don't we don't have them now like a multidisciplinary yeah exactly what's required i mean you you spoken about you said that fusion is quote the most multidisciplinary field you can imagine yes yeah why why is that what are the yeah well because because most of our discussion that we've had so far is really like a physics discussion really so which don't don't neglect physics is at the origin of this but i've already we touched on plasma physics and nuclear physics which are basically two you know somewhat overlap but independent disciplines then when it comes to the engineering it's almost everything so so why is this well let's build let's build an electromagnet together okay what is this gonna take it's gonna take it's basically electrical engineering computer in so you understand what how it goes together what happens computational engineering to model this very complex integrated thing materials engineering because it's this you're pushing materials to their limit with respect to stress and so forth it takes cryogenic engineering which is sort of a subdiscipline but cooling things to extremely low temperatures probably some kind of chemistry thing in there too well actually yeah which tends to show up in the materials and that's just one of the sub components of it like almost everything gets hit in this right so you're and you're also in a very integrated environment because in the end all these things while you isolate them from each other in a physics sense in an engineering sense you they all have to work like seamlessly together so it's one of those i mean i've in my own career i've basically done atomic physics spectroscopy you know plasma physics ion etching so this includes material science something called mhd magnetohydrodynamics and now all the way through like i i don't i'm not even sure how many a recruiting stage for like young scientists thinking to come in like my comment aside is if you're bored in fusion you're not paying attention because there's always something interesting to go and and do so that's a really important part of what we're what we're doing which isn't new in fusion actually and in fact is in the roots of of what we've done at mit but holy cow like the proximity of of possibility of commercial fusion is the new thing you know so my catchphrase is like you may wonder like why weren't we doing all these things like why weren't we pushing towards economic fusion and new materials and new methods of heat extraction and so forth because everybody knew fusion was forty years away and now it's four years away there is a history like you said forty thirty whatever mhmm that kind of old joke there's a history of fusion projects that you know are characterized by cost overruns and delays yeah how do you avoid this how do you minimize the chance of this you have to build great teams is one of them it tends to be that the smaller the there's sort of an like like i'm not an expert in this but you i've seen there's enough integrated is there any equations yeah well there's almost and there's there's i i've seen this from enough teams like i've seen also the futility of lone geniuses trying to solve everything by themselves like no but also organizations that have ten thousand people in them is is just not doesn't lend itself at all to innovation so like one of our original sponsors and a good friend vinod khosla i don't know if you've ever talked to vinod khosla he's a venture he's got fantastic ideas about like the right sizes of teams and things that really innovate right and and there is an optimum place in there is that you get enough cross discipline and ideas but it doesn't become so overly bureaucratic that you can't execute on it so so one of the ways and this was one of the challenges of fusion is that everything was leading towards like i have to have like enormously large like teams just to execute because of the scale of the project the fact that now through techno through both technology and the argue financing innovation we're we're driving to the point where it's smaller focused teams about doing those things so that's one way to make it faster the other way to make it faster is modularize the the problem or or parse the problem so this is the other difficulty infusion is that you know you tend to look at this as like oh it's it's really just about making the plasma into this state you know here that you get this energy gain no because in the end if you can parse out the different problems of making that and then make it as separate as possible from extracting the energy and then converting it into electricity the more separate those are the better they are because you get parallel paths that basically mitigate risk this is not new infusion by the way and this is the way that we attack most complex technological you know integrated technological challenges have you by any chance seen some of the application of artificial intelligence reinforcement learning a deepmind has a has a nice paper has a nice effort yeah on basically using reinforcement learning for a learned control algorithm for for controlling nuclear fusion yeah do you do you find those kinds of i guess you throw them under the umbrella of computational modeling do you find those interesting promising directions they're all they're all interesting so when when people you know i'll pull back maybe a a natural question is like why is it different in fusion like there's a long history to fusion right it was going on for like i told you like stories from the late 1960s like what's different now right so i think from the from the technology point of view there's two massive things which are different so one of them you know i'll be parochial it's the advent of this new superconducting materials because the most mature ways that we understand about how we're gonna get to fusion power plants are magnetic fusion and by the fact that you've got access to something which like changes the economic equation by an over and order magnitude is just a totally you know and that that wasn't that long ago it was only september of twenty twenty one that we actually demonstrated the technology that changes the the prospects there and the other one is computing and it's across the whole spectrum it's not just in control of the fusion device it's actually in the we actually use machine learning and things like this in the design of the magnet itself it's an incredibly complex design space so you use those tools the simulation of the plasma itself is actually we're at a totally different place than we were because of those things so those are the two big drivers that i see actually that make it different and actually and it's interesting both those things self enforce about what you asked about before like how do you avoid delays and things well it's by having smaller teams that can actually execute on those but now you can do this because the new magnets make the devices all smaller mhmm and the computing means your human effectiveness about exploring the optimization space is way better it's like they're all interlinked to each other so cluster modularization like you said and it's everything just kind of works works together to make smaller teams more effective move faster and it's actually and it's through that learned experience i mean you know of the things that i'm the most proud of about what came out in fact the origins of thinking about how we would use the the the the high temperature superconducting magnets came out of my design class at mit and in the design class like one of the features that i kept i mean it was interesting i actually learned i really learned along with the students about this but like this insistence on the features like we can't have so many coupled integrated hard technology developments like we have to separate these somehow so we worked and worked and worked at this and in fact that that's what really in in my opinion the greatest advantage of the arc design and when it come you know and and built into the commonwealth fusion system idea is like to parse out the problems like how can we attack these in parallel yeah and so it really comes to a we talked about philosophy it's like a design philosophy like how do you attack these these kinds of problems and you know you do it like that and also like you mentioned offline that there's a power to you know as part of a class yeah to design a nuclear fusion it's a big plan well then then it is reality and i and it's it's hard to imagine a more powerful force than like fifteen mit phd students yeah like working together towards solving a problem and what i always in fact we just we recently just taught the the the most recent you know i say i teach it i mean i i guide it actually the most recent version of this where they actually designed you know based on this national academy's report they actually designed like the pilot plant that has basis and similarities to what we had done before but you know i kept wanting to like push the envelope in where they are it's like the creativity and the and the the energy that they bring to these things is kind of like it keeps me going like that's you know i'm not gonna retire anytime soon when i keep seeing that kind of dedication and it's wonderful around on that it almost not to overuse a or to paraphrase something right which is that you know the the famous quote by margaret mead you know never doubt that a small group of dedicated you know persons will change the world indeed it's the only thing that ever has i mean that's just such a powerful and inspiring thing for an individual find the right team be part of that and then you yourself your passion your efforts could actually make a big change yeah a big impact i i gotta ask you so it's it's a whole another different conversation i'm sure to have but nuclear power as it currently stands so using fission is extremely safe despite public perception it is the safest actually so that's a whole another conversation but almost like a human bureaucratic physics engineering question of what lessons do you draw from the catastrophic events where they the the the pop lands did fail so chernobyl and three mile island chernobyl what lessons do you draw actually three mile island wasn't really a disaster because nothing escaped from the thing but but chernobyl and fukushima were have been you know had obvious consequences in the populations and that live nearby what lesson do you draw from those yeah that you can carry forward to fusion now i know there's you can say that you're not gonna have the same kind of issues but it's possible that the same folks also said they're not gonna be have those same kind of issues yeah yeah we humans the human factor we haven't talked about that one quite as much but it's still there so to be clear it's so fusion has the intrinsic safety with respect to it can't run away those those are physics basis technology and engineering basis of running a complex and again anything that makes large amounts of power and heats things up has got intrinsic safety in it and by the fact that we actually produce very energetic particles this doesn't mean that there's no radiation involved in ionizing radiation to be more accurate infusion it's just that it's in a very different order of magnitude basically so what are the lessons in in fusion so so one of them is make sure that you're looking at aspects of the holistic environmental and societal footprint that the technology will have as technologists we tend not to focus on these and particularly in early stages of development like we just want something that works right but if we if we come with just something that works but doesn't actually satisfy the societal demands for safety and for i mean we will have materials that we have to dispose of out of fusion just this is but there's technological questions about what that looks like so will this look like something that you have to you know put in the ground for a hundred years or five years like and the consequences of those are both economic and societal acceptance and so forth but don't bury those like put the bring these up front talk to people about them and make people realize that you're actually you know the way i would look at it is that you're making fusion more economically attractive by making it more societally acceptable as well too and then realize is that you know i think there's a few interesting you know boundaries basically so one of them speaking of boundaries that successful fusion devices i'm pretty sure will require that you don't have to have an evacuation plan for anybody who lives at the site boundary mhmm so this has this has implications for what we build from a fusion engineering point of view but has major implications for where you can cite fusion devices right mhmm so in many ways it becomes more like well you know we have fences around you know industrial heat sources and things like this for a reason right for personal safety it looks more like that right it's not quite as simple as that but that's what it should look like and in fact we have research projects going on right now at mit that are like trying to push the technologies to make it more look like that i think that those are key and then in the end as i said like so chernobyl is physically impossible actually in a in a fusion system from a physics perspective from a physics perspective you can't run away like it did at at chernobyl which was basically human error that you know of letting letting the reactors like run out of control essentially human error can still happen nuclear with fusion based reactors so but in that one if human error occurs then it just stops and this is done and all of those things this is the requirement of of us as technologists and and and developers of this technology to not ignore that dimension in fact of the design and that's why me personally i'm actually pouring myself more and more into that area because this is going to be i i actually really think it is an aspect of the economic viability of fusion because it clearly differentiates ourselves and also sets us up to be about what we want fusion to be is that again on paper fusion can supply all of our energy like all of it so this means i want it to be like like really environmentally benign but this takes engineering ingenuity basically to do that let me ask you some wild out there questions so for we've been talking too much you know simple practical things in everyday life no only revolutionizing the entire energy infrastructure of human civilization yes but so cold fusion yeah this this idea this dream this interesting physical goals seem to be impossible but perhaps it's possible do you think it is possible do you think down the line somewhere in in in the far distance is possible to achieve fusion at a low temperature it's very very very unlikely and this comes from so this would require a pretty fundamental shift in our understanding of of physics like as we know it now and we know a heck of a lot about how nuclear reactions occur by the way what's interesting is that there's they they actually have a different name for it they call it leaner like low energy nuclear reactions but we do have low energy nuclear reactions we know these it's because these come from particularly the weak interaction the weak force nuclear force and so it's at this point you know as a scientist you always keep yourself open because but you also demand proof right and that's the thing it almost requires a breakdown on the theoretical physics side so something some deeper understanding about quantum mechanics something so the quantum tunneling some some weird yeah and that and and people have looked at that but even like something like quantum tunneling has a limit as to what it can actually do so there there are people who are genuine you know that that really want to see it make but you know sort of goes to the i mean we know fusion happens at these high energies like when we know this extremely accurately and i can show you a plot that shows that as you go to lower lower energy it basically becomes immeasurable so if you're going down this other pathway it means there's really a very different physical mechanism involved so all i would say is that i i i actually poke in my head once in a while to see what's going on in that area and as scientists we should always try to make ourselves open and but in this one it's like but show me something that i can measure and that is repeatable and then and then it's then it's gonna take more extraordinary effort and and to date this has not met that threshold in my opinion so i'm even more so than just mentioning or in that question thinking about people that are claiming to have achieved cold fusion i'm more thinking even about people who are studying black holes and they're they're basically trying to understand the function of you know theoretical physicists yeah they are doing the the long haul yeah look trying to investigate like okay what is happening at the singularity what is the this kind of holographic projections on a plate these weird freaking things that are out there in the universe and like somehow accidentally they start to figure out something weird weird yeah and then all of a sudden there's weirdness all over the place already yeah somehow that weirdness will yeah i think on a time scale probably of a hundred years or so that weirdness will open yeah so it it just seems like nuclear fusion and black holes and all of this are too they're next door neighbors a little bit yeah too much for like you'll find something yeah interesting let me tell you a story about this yes okay every it's a real story yeah so there are really really clever scientists in the in the end of the late eighteen hundreds in the world you talk about like james clerk maxwell and you talk about lord kelvin and you talk about lorenz actually who named after these other ones and you on and on and on and like faraday and they discovered electromagnetism holy cow and it's like they figure out all these things and yet there were these weird things going on that you couldn't quite figure out it's like what the heck is going on with this right but but we we teach this all the time in in in physics classes right so what was going on well there's just a few there's just a few kind of things things unchecked but basically we're at the end of discovery because we figured out how everything works mhmm because we've got we've got basically newtonian mechanics and we've got maxwell's equations which describe basically how matter gets pushed around and how electromagnetism works holy cow what a feat but there are these few nagging things like for instance there's certain kinds of rocks that for some reason like if you put a photographic plate around it it like gets burned or it gets an image on it like well where's the electromagnetism in that there's no electromagnetic properties of this rock oh yeah and the other thing too is that if i if i take this wonderful classical derivation of how of of of something that is hot about how it releases radiation everything looks fantastic perfect match oh until i get to high frequencies of of the light and then it basically just the whole thing falls apart in fact it gives a physical explanation which is total nonsense it tells you that every object should basically be producing an infinite amount of heat mhmm and by the way here's the sun and we can look at the sun and we can figure out it's made out of hydrogen and lord kelvin actually made a very famous you know calculation who was basically one of the founders of thermodynamics so you look at the hydrogen hydrogen has a certain energy content that you know the latent heat basically of hydrogen we know the mass of the sun because we knew the size of it and he conclusively proved that basically there could only the the sun could only make net energy for about two or three thousand years so therefore all this nonsense about like deep it's like because clearly the sun can only last for two or three thousand years if you think about the chem and this is basically the chemical energy content of hydrogen and what comes along in one decade basically one guy sitting in a postal office you know in switzerland figures out that all these you know einstein of course which was like figured out all this create like took these these seemingly unconnected things and it's like boom there it is this is why it wasn't just him but it was like there's quantum physics like this explains this other disaster and then there's other guy my hero ernest rutherford experimentalist did the most extraordinary experiment which is like which was that okay they had these funny rocks they emitted these particles in fact they called them alpha particles alpha just a in the alphabet right because it was the first thing that they discovered and what were they doing so they were they were taking these alpha particles and i by the way i do this to all my students because it's a demonstration of what you should be as a good scientist so he took these alpha things and he's a classically trained physicist knew everything about momentum scattering and so forth like that and he took this and these alpha which clearly were some kind of energy but they couldn't quite figure out what it was so so let's try to figure that we'll actually use this to try to probe the nature of matter so he took this took these alpha particles in a very very thin gold foil and so what you wanted to see was that as they were going through the way that they would scatter based on classical in fact the coulomb collision based on classical mechanics this will tell me reveal something about what the nature of the charge distribution is in matter because they didn't know like where the hell is this stuff coming from even though they'd solved that electromagnetism they didn't know like what made up charges mhmm okay very interesting on and through it goes and so what did you set up so it turns out in the in these experiments what you did was because if these out these so called alphas which actually now we know is something else as they go through they would deflect how much they deflect tells you how strong an electric field they saw so you put detectors because if you put if you put like a piece of glass in front of this what will happen is that when the alpha particle hits it literally gives a little boop a little of light like this it scintillates a little blue flash so he would train his students or post doc or whatever the heck they were at the time you have to train yourself because you have to put yourself in the dark for like hours to get your eyes adjusted and then they would start the experiment and they would sit there and literally count the things and they could see this pattern developing which was revealing about what was going on but there was also another part to the experiment which was that it's like here's the alphas here's the source they're going this they could tell they were going in one direction only basically they're going in this direction and you put all these over here because you wanna see how they deflect and bend through it but you put a control in the experiment but you basically put glass particle glass glass plates back here because obviously everything should just deflect but nothing should bounce back so it's a control of the experiment mhmm but what did what did they see they they saw things bouncing back like what the hell like that fit no model of any idea right but rutherford like refused to like ignore what was a clear like they validated it and he sat down and based on classical physics he made the most extraordinary discovery which was the nucleus which is a very very strange discovery what what i mean by that because what he could figure out from this is that in order for these particles to bounce back and hit this plate they were hitting something that must be heavier than them and that that basically something like ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the mass of the matter that was in this gold foil was in something that contained about one trillionth of the volume of it mhmm and that's called the nucleus and until and you talk about so how revealing is this it's like this totally changes your idea of the universe because a nucleus is a very unintuitive nonintuitive thing it's like why is all the mass in something that is like zero like basically is the realization that matter is empty mhmm it's all empty space and that changes everything and it changes everything until you had that like you had steam engines by the way you had telegraph wires you had all those things but that that realization like opened up those two realization opened up everything like lasers every all you just think about the modern world of what we use and that set it up so all i would point out is that there's a story already that sometimes there's these nagging things at the edge of science that you know we seem we we pat ourselves on the back and we think we got everything under control of course that by the way that was the origin of also that that it think about this that was nineteen o eight it took like another twenty some years before people put that together with that's the process that's powering stars mhmm it's the rearrangement of those nuclei not atoms that's why rather kelvin wasn't wrong he just he was working with the wrong assumptions right so fast forward to today like what would this mean right now there's a couple of things like this that sit out there in physics and i'll point out one of them which is very interesting we don't know what the hell makes up ninety percent of the mass in the universe mhmm so the you know the search for dark matter right what is it we still haven't discovered it yeah ninety percent of the mass of the universe is undetectable like what and then you know and dark energy and the again black holes are the the window into this well then black hole but i mean sometimes black holes are way better understood than than those things as well too so all it tells us is that we shouldn't have hubris about the ideas that we understand everything and when we you know who knows what the next major intellectual insight will be about how the universe you know functions and actually i think rutherford is the one who's attributed at least that that quote that physics is the only real science everything else is stamp collecting right so there's i'm sorry he's my hero but i'll slightly disagree with that yes well no offense to stamp collecting that's very important too but you know that you have to have humility about the kind of disciplines that make progress at every stage in in in science yeah exactly physics did make a huge amount of progress in the twentieth century but it's possible that other disciplines start to step in yeah but rutherford couldn't imagine like mapping the human genome because we didn't even know about dna yeah or computers really or computers he really probably didn't think deep about computation like is it here's here's a wild one what if like the next great revelation to humanity about the universe is not done by the human mind that seems increasingly likely more likely yeah and then you start to ask deep questions about what is the purpose of science for example if ai system will design a nuclear fusion reactor better than humans do but we don't quite understand how it works and the ai can't we know that it works we could test it very thoroughly mhmm but we don't know exactly what the control mechanisms is maybe what the chemistry the physics is ai can't quite explain it they just can't it's it's it's impenetrable to our consciousness basically i'm trying to hold it all together and then and then okay so now we're living in that world where many of the biggest discoveries are made by ai systems yeah as if we weren't going big but i i say you know it's again i'll point out like when my when i when my godmother was born like we none of this was in front of us right it's like yeah we live in an amazing time it's like right like my grandfather you know plowed you know fields with a horse i get to work on designing fusion reactors yeah yeah pretty amazing time but still there's humans so we'll see we'll see we'll see if that's around a hundred years maybe it'll be cyborgs rob us i think we're pretty resilient actually yeah i know that that's that's one lesson from life is it finds a way yeah let me ask you even a bigger question if is it as if those weren't big enough let's look out maybe a few hundred years maybe a few thousand years out there's something called the kardashev scale it's a method of measuring civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy it's able to use so type one civilization and this might be given all your work is not no longer a scale that makes quite make sense but it very much focuses on the source of fusion natural source of fusion which is for us the sun and type one civilizations are able to leverage sort of collect all the energy that hits earth and then type two civilizations are the ones that are able to leverage the entirety of the energy that comes from the sun by maybe building something like a dyson sphere yeah yeah so when will we reach type one status is get to the level which we're i think maybe a few orders of magnitude away from currently and in general do you think about this kind of stuff because where energy is so fundamental to yeah the like of life on earth but also the expansion of life into the universe oh oh yeah so one one of the fun you know on the on a weekend when i i i sat down and figured out what would it mean for interstellar travel like to have a a dt fusion in fact one of the i talked about my design class one of my design classes was how you use essentially a special configuration of a fusion device for not only traveling to but colonizing mars mhmm so because what we're we're you talk about energy use being at the heart of civilization it's like so what if you want to go to mars not to just visit it but actually like leave people there and make it something happen mhmm needs massive amounts of energy so what would that look like and it it actually transforms what what how you're thinking about doing that as well too oh yeah so we we do all those kinds of fun and actually it was it was a fairly you know quasi realistic actually so do you think it'll be nuclear fusion that powers the civilization on mars well what we considered was something so it turns out that there's thorium which is a heavy element it's so it's a so called fertile element that we know what we we still know fairly little about the the the geology of mars in in in a deep sense and we know that there's a lot of this on the surface of mars so one of the things we considered was what would happen that it's basically a combination of a fusion device that actually makes fuel from the thorium oh but the under but the underlying energy one was was fission itself as well too so this is one of the examples of being trying to be clever right around those things or what is it you know this also means it's like in interstellar travel it's like oh yeah that looks almost like impossible basically from an energy balance point of view just because like the energy required to that you have to transport to get there almost the only things that would work are d t fusion and basically annihilation it's like star trek right so inter your sense is that interstellar travel will require fusion power oh it's it's almost even impossible with fusion power actually it's so hard it's so hard because you have to carry the fuel with you and the rocket equation tells you about how much fuel you'll use to take so what you end up with is like how long does it take to go to these places and it's like staggering you know periods of time so i i tend to believe that there's alien civilizations dispersed all throughout yeah but we might be totally isolated from them do you think we're not there's none in this galaxy so like and i guess and the question i also have is what kind of do you think they have nuclear fusion because like is it all is the physics all the same yeah all the physics is all the same yeah right so this is the and this is the fermi paradox like where where the hell is everybody in the universe well there's some so you know the the scariest one of those is that i would point out that there's been you know there's you know order of many tens of millions of species on the planet earth and only one ever got to the point of sophisticated tool use that we could actually start essentially leveraging the power of what what's in nature to our own will does this mean that basically this means so almost look there is almost certainly life or dna equivalents or whatever would be somewhere i mean just because you just need a soup and you need energy and you get organics and whatever the equivalent of amino acids are and but you know most of the life on earth has been that those are still amazing but it's still like it's it's not very interesting are we are we actually the accident of history this is a very super rare accident super rare and then of course the other part is that also just the other scary part of it which is if you look at the faraday paradox is good good we got to this point how long has it been in humans so humans homo sapien has been around for whatever one hundred thousand years two hundred thousand years something like that our ability in in that timeline to actually make an imprint on the universe like for by emitting radio waves or by modifying you know nature in a significant way has only been for about a hundred of those hundred thousand years and you know are we this is a good question so is it by definition that by the fact that when you are able to reach that level of being able to manipulate nature and for for example discover you know discover like fission or or or other or or or burning fossil fuels and all this is that what it says oh you're doomed because by definition any species that gets to that point that can modify their environment like that they'll actually push themselves you know past that's that's one of the most depressing scenarios that i can imagine yeah so the the so basically we're we'll we will never line up in time because you get this little teeny window in time of where civilization might occur and you you can never see it because you never these these sort of like scatter like like fireflies around the galaxy and you never yeah yeah it splits up it's up it's up it's up and then explodes destroys itself because of the or it's natural and when we say destroy ourselves all we'd have to do is that we basically go if if you humans are all left and we're still living on the planet and yeah but all we have to do is go to the technology of like you know eighteen hundred yeah and we're invisible in the universe again yeah so it was when i when i listened to the i i thought i wanted to to talk about this as well too because it's it comes from well it comes from a science point of view actually of what it means but also to me it's like another compelling driver of telling us it's like why we should try really hard not to screw this up like we're in this unique place of our ability to discover and to make it and i just don't want to give up about thinking that we can get through yeah i i tend to see that there is some kind of game theoretic force like with the mutually assured destruction that ultimately in each human being there's a desire to survive and a willingness to cooperate yeah to have compassion for each other in order to survive yeah and i think that's i mean maybe not in in humans but i can imagine a nearly infinite number of species in which that overpowers any technological advancement that can destroy yeah or or rewind the species so i think if humans fail i hope they don't i see a lot of evidence for them not but it seems like somebody will survive and there you start to ask questions about why why we haven't met yet maybe it's just space is large oh space is it's i i think in logarithms and i can't even fathom you know space this is extraordinary right yeah it's extraordinarily large yeah i mean there's so many places on earth i just recently visited paris for the first time yeah and there's so many other places i haven't visited there's so many other places well i i like to you know it's interesting that we have this fascination with alien life we have what is essentially alien life on earth already like you think about the organisms that develop around deep sea like thermal vents one of my favorite books of all time from stephen j gould if you've never read that book it kind of blows your mind it's it's about the cambrian explosion mhmm of life and it's like oh you look at these things and it's like our the chance of us existing as a species like the the the genetic diversity was larger back then mhmm you know this is about five about five hundred million years ago or something like that it is a mind altering trip of thinking about our place in the universe i have to say plus the mind itself yeah is a kind of alien with almost almost a mystery to ourselves we still don't understand it the very the very mechanism that helps us explore the world is still a mystery yeah so that like understanding that will also unlock quite quite possibly unlock our ability to understand the world and maybe build machines that help us understand the world build tools that yes i mean it already has i mean our ability to understand the world is is ridiculous almost actually and and post the bottom on tiktok it's almost unbelievable like where where we've gotten all this to yeah so what advice would you give to young folks or folks of all ages who are lost in this world looking for a way looking for a career they they can be proud of or looking to have a life they can be proud of yeah oh the first thing i would say is don't give up i get to see multiple sides of this and you know there's there seems to be a level of despair in a young generation it's like you know it's it's almost like the monty python skit like i'm not dead yet right i mean like we're we're we're we're not there we're we're we're we're in a place that you know in in in you know you know don't say the world's gonna end in three hundred days or something it's it's not okay and and what we mean by this is that we have a robust society that's figured out how to do like amazing things and we're gonna keep doing amazing things but that shouldn't be complacency about what our future is and the future for their children as well too and in the end i mean it's a very it's a staggering legacy to think of what we've built up primarily by basically using carbon fuels like people almost tend to think of this as an evil thing that we've done mhmm i think it's it's an amazing thing that we've done but we owe it to ourselves and and and to this thing that we've built i mean we're talking about the end of the world is this nonsense what it is is it's the end of this kind of lifestyle and civilization at this scale and the ability to execute on these kinds of things that we are talking about today like we are extraordinarily privileged we are in a place where it's just it's it's almost unfathomable compared to most of the misery that humans have lived in for our history so don't give up about this okay but also roll up your sleeves and let's get going at solving and getting real solutions to the problems that are in front of us which are significant you know it's i would argue most of them are linked to how what we use in energy but it's not just that it's it's around all the aspects of like what does it mean like what does it mean to have a distributed energy source that lifts billions of people out of poverty you know particularly outside of like the western nations right that seems to me a pretty compelling you know moral goal for our for all of us but particularly for this upcoming you know generation and then the other part is that is that we've got possible solutions in front of us apply your talents in a way that that that you're passionate about and is gonna make a difference and that's only possible with optimism hope and hard work yeah what easy question certainly easier than nuclear fusion what's the meaning of life why are we here forty two is it forty two no no we already discussed about the beauty of physics there's almost a desire to ask a why question about why the parameters have these values yeah it's very tempting yeah it's it's an interesting hole to go down as a scientist because we're a part of what people have a hard time people who aren't scientists have a hard time understanding what scientists do to themselves and a great scientist does a very non intuitive or non human thing what we do is we train ourselves to doubt ourselves like hell like that's a great scientist we doubt everything we see we doubt everything that we think because we we we try to we we basically try to turn off the belief valve right that that humans just naturally have so when it comes to these things like i can i can make my own comments to this is like personally you see these things about the ratios of life and i made a comment where i said well you know i wrap my some part of my brain that just goes yeah well yeah because we're the only interesting you know multiverse because by definition it has to look like this yeah you know but there's i have to say there's other times i can say in the history of the whole of what has happened over the last ten years there have been some pretty weird coincidences like coincidences that like you look at it and just go is that really was that really a coincidence is something like pushing us toward towards these things yeah and it's a natural it's a human instinct because you know since the beginnings of humanity we've always assigned you know you know human motivation and and and needs to these somewhat you know empirical observations and in some sense the stories before we understand the real explanations the stories the myths service as as a good approximation yeah for the thing that we're yet to understand absolutely and in that sense you said the antithesis to sort of scientific doubt is is having a faith in these stories they're almost silly when looked at from a scientific perspective but just even the feelings of it seems that love is a fundamental fabric of human condition yeah and what the hell is that well actually we we're so connected to each other as a as a physicist i go it's you know this is a repeatable thing yeah that's due to a set of synapses that fire in a particular pattern and all this yes you know that's kind of like okay man what a you know what a drag that is right to think of it this way and you can have an evolutionary biology explanation but there's still a magic to it i mean i see scientists i some of my colleagues you know do this as well too like where what what is spirituality compared to science and and so forth i my my own my own feeling in this is that you know as a scientist because i've had the pleasure of being able to like both understand what my predecessors did but i also had the privilege of being able to discover things right as a scientist and and i see that and you just and just in just the range of our conversations like that is my in in a weird way my it's the awe that comes from looking at that that is if you're not in awe of the universe and nature you haven't been paying attention i mean my own personal feeling is that i feel if i go if i go snorkeling on an on a coral reef i feel more awe than i could ever feel like in a in a church you kinda notice some kind of magic there there's something about the way the whole darn thing holds together that just sort of escapes your imagination and that's to me the this thing of and then we have different words we call them holistic or spiritual the way that it all hangs together in fact one of the interesting you asked about like what i think about well the craziest things that i that i think that how does it hold together is like our society mhmm like how does what yeah like how are because there's no way like you just think of the united states there's three hundred and like thirty million people kind of working like this engine mhmm about going towards making all these things happen but there's like no one in charge of this really not really yeah how the how the heck does this happen yeah it's kind of like it's so these things these are the kinds of things mathematically and organization wise that i think of just because they're they're sort of they're awe inspiring and there's different ideas that we come up together and we share them and then there's there's teams of people that share different ideas and those ideas compete like there's the ideas themselves are these kinds of different organisms and ultimately somehow we build bridges and and nuclear reactors and do those things well i have to give a shout out to my daughter by the way who's who's a who's interested she's an applied math major and she's she's amazing at math and over the break she was showing she was doing research and it's it's basically about how ideas and ethos are transmitted within a society nice so she's built an applied math model that is explaining like she was showing me in this like this simulation she goes oh look look at this and i said oh oh that's like how political parties like evolve right yeah and even though it was a rather you know quote unquote simple math mathematical model it wasn't really it's like oh wow well maybe she has a chance to derive the the answer to the what what's the meaning of life there we go and maybe it is indeed forty two well dennis thank you so much for just doing creating tools creating systems exploring this idea that's one of the most amazing magical ideas in all of human endeavor which is nuclear fusion i mean that's so interesting i i you know it's almost like my one of my lifelong goals is like to make it it's like it's not magic it's like it's it's boring as all heck and this means we're using it everywhere right yeah yeah yeah and the magic is then built on top of it yeah well thank you for everything you do thank you for talking to me it's a huge honor this was a fascinating and amazing conversation thank you thanks for listening to this conversation with dennis white to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from albert einstein there are two ways to live your life one is as though nothing is a miracle the other is though everything's a miracle thank you for listening i hope to see you next time
