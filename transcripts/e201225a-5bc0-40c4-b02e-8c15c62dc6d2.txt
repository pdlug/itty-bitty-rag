is a lex fridman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's serhiy plohi what are the major explanations for the collapse of the soviet union maybe ones you agree with and ones you disagree with very often people confuse three different processes that were taking place in the late eighties and early nineties and the one was the collapse of communism as ideology another was the end of the cold war and the third one was the end of the soviet union all of these processes were interrelated interconnected but when people provide ideology as the explanation for all of these processes that's where i disagree because ideological collapse happened on the territory of the soviet union in general soviet union lost the cold war whether we are talking about moscow leningrad or saint petersburg now or vladivostok but the fall of the soviet union is about a story in which vladivostok and saint petersburg ended up in one country and ended in different countries so the theories and explanations about how did that happen for me these are really very helpful theories for understanding the soviet collapse so the mobilization from below the collapse of the center against the background of economic collapse against the background of ideological ideological implosion that's that's how i look at the at the fall of the soviet union and that's how i look at the theories that explain that collapse so it's a story of geography ideology economics which are the most important to understand of what made the collapse of the soviet union happen the soviet collapse was unique but not more unique than collapse of any other empire so what we really witnessed or the the the world witnessed back in nineteen ninety one and we continue to witness today with the russian aggression against ukraine is a collapse of one of the largest world empires we talk about talked about the soviet union and now talk about russia as possessing plus minus one sixth of the surface of the earth you don't get in possession of one sixth of the earth by being a nation state you get that sort of size as an empire and the soviet collapse is continuation of the disintegration of the russian empire that started back in nineteen seventeen that was arrested for some period of time by the bolsheviks by the communist ideology which which was internationalist ideology and then came back in full force in the late eighties and early nineties so the most important story for me this is the story of the continuing collapse of the russian empire and the rise of not just local nationalism but also rise of russian nationalism that turned out to be as a destructive force for the imperial or multi multiethnic multinational state as was ukrainian nationalism or georgian or or estonian for that matter oh you said a lot of interesting stuff there nineteen seventeen bolsheviks internationalists how that plays with the idea of russian empire and so on but first let me ask about us influence on this so one of the ideas is that you know through the cold war that mechanism us had made your interest to weaken the soviet union and therefore it the collapse could be attributed to pressure and manipulation from the united states is there truth to that the pressure from the united states this is part of the cold war and cold war part of that story but it's it it doesn't it doesn't explain the soviet collapse and the reason is quite simple the united states of america didn't want the soviet union to collapse and disintegrate they didn't want that at the start of the cold war in nineteen forty eight we now have the strategic documents they were concerned about that they didn't want to do that and certainly they didn't want to do that in the year nineteen ninety ninety one as late as august of nineteen ninety one the day of coup the the month of the coup in moscow president bush george h w bush travels from moscow to kyiv and gives famous or infamous speech called chicken kiev speech basically warning ukrainians against going for independence the soviet collapse was a huge headache for the administration in the white house for a number of reasons they liked to work with gorbachev the soviet union was emerging as a junior partner of the united states in the international arena collapse was destroying all of that and on the top of that there was a question of the nuclear weapons unaccounted nuclear weapons so the united states was doing everything humanly possible to keep the soviet union together in one piece until really late november of nineteen ninety one when it became clear that it was it was a lost cause and they had to say goodbye to to gorbachev and to the project that he he introduced a few months later or a year later there was a presidential campaign and bush was running for the second term and was looking for for achievements and there were many achievements i i i basically treat him with great respect but destruction destruction of the soviet union was not one of those achievements he was on the on the other side of the of that divide but the the the the politics the political campaign of course have their own rules and they produce and give birth to mythology which we we still at least in this country we live till now till today so gorbachev is an interesting figure in all of this is there a possible history where soviet union did not collapse and some of the ideas that gorbachev had for the future of the soviet union came to life of course history on the one hand there is a statement it it doesn't allow for what ifs on the other hand in my opinion history is full of what if that's what history is about and certainly certainly there there are scenarios how the soviet union would would would continue would continue beyond let's say gorbachev's tenure mhmm and the argument has been made that the reforms that he introduced that they were mismanaged and they could be managed differently or there could be no reforms and there could be continued stagnation so that is all possible what i think would happen one way or another is the soviet collapse in a different form on on somebody else's watch at some later period in time because we we dealing with not just processes that were happening in the soviet union we're dealing with global processes and the twentieth century turned out to be the century of the disintegration of the empires you look at the globe at the map of the world in nineteen fourteen and you compare it to to the map at the end of the twentieth century nineteen ninety one nineteen ninety two and suddenly you realize that there are many candidates for being the most important event the most important process in the twentieth century but the biggest the biggest global thing that happened was redrawing the map of the world and producing dozens if not hundreds of new states that's the outcome of the different processes of the twentieth century look yugoslavia is falling apart around the same time czechoslovakia goes through what can be called a civilized divorce a very very rare occurrence in in the fall of multi multinational states so yeah the writing was on the wall whether it would happen under gorbachev or later whether it would happen as the result of reforms or as the result of no reforms but i i i i think that sooner or later that's that that that would happen yeah it's very possible hundreds of years from now the way the twentieth century is written about as the century defined by the collapse of empires you call the soviet union the last empire the book is called the last empire so is there something fundamental about the way the world is that means it's not conducive to the formation of empires the meaning that i was putting in the term of the soviet union as the last empire was that that was the soviet collapse was the collapse of the last major european empires traditional empires that was the in the eighteenth century nineteenth century and through most of the twentieth century the the austria hungary died in in the midst of world war one the ottoman empire disintegrated the brits were gone and and left india and there was the the the successor to the russian empire called the soviet union was still hanging hanging on there and then came nineteen ninety one and what we see even with today's russia it's it's it's a very different it's a very different sort of policies the the the russia or russian leadership tried to learn a lesson from nineteen ninety one so there is no national republics in the in the russian federation that would have more rights than the the russian administrative units so the the structure is different the nationality policies are different the the level of russification is much higher so it is it is in many ways already a post post imperial formation and you write about the that moment nineteen ninety one the role that ukraine played in that seems to be a very critical role can you describe just that what role ukraine played in the collapse of the soviet union history is many things but it started in a very simple way of making notes about on the yearly basis what happened this year or that so it's about chronology chronology in the history of the collapse of the soviet union is very important you have ukrainian referendum on december first nineteen ninety one and you have dissolution of the soviet union by the leaders of russia ukraine and belarus one week later mhmm and the question is why ukrainian referendum is is the answer but ukrainians didn't didn't answer their referendum question of whether they want the soviet union to be dissolved or not they answered very limited in terms of it's it's it's been in question whether you support the decision of virchow narada of your parliament for ukraine to go independent and the rest was not was not on the ballot so why then one week later the soviet union is gone and president yeltsin explained to president bush around that time the reason why why ukraine was so important he said that well if ukraine is gone russia is not interested in this soviet project because russia would be outnumbered and outvoted by the muslim republics so there was there was a cultural element mhmm but there was also another one ukraine happened to be the second largest soviet republic and then post soviet state in terms of population in terms of the economy economic potential and so on and so forth and as yeltsin suggested close culturally linguistically and otherwise to russia so with the second largest republic gone russia didn't think that it was in russia's interest to continue with with the soviet union and around that time yegor gaidar who was the chief economic adviser of yeltsin was telling him well we just don't have money anymore to support other republics we have to focus on russia we have to use oil and gas money within the russian federation so the state was bankrupt imperial projects at least in the context of the late twentieth century they costed money it it it wasn't a money making machine as it was back in the eighteenth or nineteenth century and the combination of all these factors led to the to the processes in which ukraine's decision to go independent spelled the end to the soviet union and if today anybody wants to restore not the soviet union but some form of russian control over the post soviet space ukraine is as important today as it was back in december of nineteen ninety one let me ask you about vladimir putin's statement that the collapse of the soviet union is one of the great tragedies of history to what degree does he have a point to what degree is he wrong his formulation was that this is the greatest the the greatest geopolitical catastrophe or tragedy of the twentieth century and i specifically went and and looked at the text and and put it in in specific time when it was happening and it was interesting that the statement was made a few weeks before the may nine parade and and celebrations of the of the victory key part of of the mythology of the current of of the current russian state so why say things about the soviet collapse being the the largest geopolitical strategy and not in that particular context the second world war my explanation at least is that the world war two the price was enormous but the soviet union emerged as a great victor and captured half of europe nineteen ninety one the the the in terms of the of the lives lost at that point the price was was actually very very low but for putin what was important that the state was lost and he in particular was concerned about the division of the russian of the russian people which he understood back then like he understands now in a very very broad terms so for him for him the biggest tragedy is not the loss of life the biggest tragedy is the loss of the great power status or or the unity of those whom he considered to be russian russian nations so at least this is my reading this is my understanding of what what what what is there what is on on on on the paper and what is between the lines so both the unity of the sort of quote russian empire and the status of the superpower that's how i read it you wrote a book the origins of the slavic nations so let's go back into history what is the origin of slavic nations we can look at that at that from different perspectives and we are now making major breakthroughs in in answering this question with the very interesting innovative linguistic analysis the study of dna so that's that's that's really the new frontier we are getting into a prehistorical period where there is no historical sources and from what we can understand today and that can of course change tomorrow with all these breakthroughs in in sciences is that the the slavs came into existence somewhere in the area of marshes pripet marshes northwestern part of ukraine southwestern part of belarus eastern part of poland and that's is considered to be historical homeland of slavs and then and then they spread and they spread all the way to the adriatic so we have croats we have russians spreading all the way to the pacific we have ukrainians we have belarusians poles once we had czechoslovaks now we have we have czechs and slovaks so that's the story of starting with the eighth and ninth century we can even a little bit early we can already follow that story with the help of the of the written sources mostly from byzantine then then then late from western from western europe but what i was trying to do not being a scientist not being an expert in in linguistics or not being an expert in in in dna analysis i was trying to see what was happening in the minds of those peoples and their elites in particular whom we call today not slavs but eastern slavs which means russians ukrainians and belarusians how they imagine themselves how they imagine their world and eventually i look at the so called nation building projects so trying to answer the question of how we arrived to the situation in which we are today where there are not just three east slavic nations but there are also three east slavic states russian ukrainian and belarussian so this is this is the focus of my of my book i end admittedly in that particular book i end on the eighteenth century before the era of nationalism but then there are other books like lost lost kingdom that where i i bring the story all the way up to today so what aspects of the eighth and ninth century the east slavic states permeates to to today that we should understand well the the most important one is that the existence of the state of kievan rus back during the medieval period created the foundations for historical mythology common historical mythology and there are just wars and battles over who has the right mhmm or more right for kevan rus' the legal code that was created at that time existed for a long period of time the acceptance of christianity from byzantium that became a big issue that separated then eastern slavs from their western neighbors including czechs and and and and and poles but united in that way to let's say bulgarians or serbs and the beginning of the written literature beginning beginning in kyiv so all of that is considered to be part of heritage all of that is being contested and this this debates that were academic for a long period of time what we see now tragically are being being continued on the on the battlefield what is kyiv what is rus' that you mentioned what's the importance of these you mentioned them as a sort of defining places and terms labels at the beginning of all this so what what is kyiv kyiv became a capital or or the the outpost of the vikings who were try trying to establish control over the trade route between what what is today's western russia and and and belarus and northern ukraine so the forest areas and the biggest and the richest market in the world that existed at that time which was in constantinople in byzantium so the idea it was the idea was to get whatever goods you can get in that part of eastern europe and most of those goods were slaves local population put them on the ships in kyiv because kyiv was on the border with the step zones step zones were controlled by other peep other groups scythians sarmatians and so on and you you you you name it and then staying on the on the river being protected from attacks of the moments to come to the black sea and and sell these products in constantinople that was that was the idea that was the model vikings vikings tried to practice that sort of of of business model also in other parts of europe and like in other parts of europe they turned out to be by by default creators of new politics of new states and that was that was the story of the first of the first kievan dynasty and kyiv as the capital of that huge empire that was going from the baltics to today's central ukraine and then was trying to get through the southern ukraine to to the black sea that was a major major european state kingdom if you if you want to call it of medieval europe with a lot creating a lot of tradition in terms of dynasty in terms of language in terms of religion in terms of again historical mythology so kyiv is central for for the nation nation building myth of a number a number of groups in the region so in one perspective and narrative kyiv is at the center of this russian empire at which point does moscow become come to prominence as the center of the russian empire well the russian empire is a term and really creation of the eighteenth century what we what we have for the kievan we call it kievan rus again this is a term of the nineteenth century they call themselves rus rus and there was metropolitan of rus' and there was rus' principalities so very important to keep in mind that rus' is not russia because that was a self name for all multiple groups on that on that territory and moscow doesn't exist at the time when kyiv emerges as as the capital mhmm the first the first reference to moscow comes from the twelfth century when it was founded by one of the kavan one of the kavan princes and moscow comes to prominence really in a very different context and with a very different empire running the show in the region the story of moscow and the rise of moscow this is the story of the mongol rule over over former rus' lands and former rus' territories the the part of the former rus' eventually overthrows the the mongol control with the help of the small group of people called lithuanians which which had a young young state and young dynasty and and united the this lands which were mostly in today's terms ukrainian and belarusian so they separate early and what is today's russia mostly western russia central russia stays under the mongol control up until late fifteenth century and that was the story when moscow moscow rises as the new capital of that realm replacing the city of vladimir as as that capital for those who ever went to russia they they familiar with the with of course vladimir as the place of the oldest architectural monuments the so called the golden ring of russia and so on and so forth vladimir is central and there are so many architectural monuments there because before there was moscow there was vladimir eventually in this in this struggle over over control of the territory struggle for favors from from the mongols and and and the tatar horde moscow emerges as as the center of that particular realm under mongols after the mongol rule is removed moscow embarks on the project that historians russian historians of the nineteenth century called the gathering of the russian lands using russian now for rus' and and and and trying to to bring back the the the lands of of former kyivan rus' but also the lands of the former mongol empire the russians get to the pacific before they get to kyiv historically and really the the the quote quote unquote gathering of the quote unquote russian lands ends only in nineteen forty five when the soviet union bullies the czechoslovak government into turning what is today's transcarpetian ukraine to the soviet union it is included in the ukrainian soviet socialist republic so that's that's the moment when that destiny the way how it was imagined by the nineteen century russian historian was eventually fulfilled moscow was in control of all these lands so to what degree are the slavic people one people and this is a theme that will continue throughout i think versus a collection of multiple peoples whether we're talking about the kievan rus' or we're talking about the nineteenth century russian empire conception well a number of ways to look at that one the most obvious the most clear is language and there there is no question that poles speak a separate language in their slavs and there is no question for anyone going to ukraine and here in ukrainian realizing that this is not russian the level of comprehension can be different you can understand certain words and you you you don't understand others and the same would be with with polish and the same would be with czech so there is this linguistic linguistic history that is in common but languages very clearly indicate that you are deal you are dealing with different with different peoples we we know that language is not everything americans speak a particular way of english australians speak a particular variant of english but for reasons of geography history we we pretty much believe that despite linguistic unity these are different nations and different peoples and and there there are there are some parts of political tradition are in common others others are quite different so the same when it comes to language the same when it comes to political tradition to the loyalty to the political institution applies to slavic nations so that's that's again there is nothing particularly unique about the slavs in that regard you wrote the book the cossack myth history and nationhood in the age of empires it tells the story of an an anonymous manuscript called the history of the rus' it started being circulated in eighteen twenties i i would love it if you can tell the story of this this is supposedly one of the most impactful texts in history modern history so what's the importance of this text what did it contain how did it define the future of the region in the first decades of the nineteenth century after napoleonic wars a mysterious text emerged that was attributed to a orthodox archbishop that was long dead which was claiming that the cossacks of ukraine were in fact the original rus' people and that they they had the right for particular place for central place in in the russian empire and it tells the history of the cossacks full it's it's the era of romanticism full of all sorts of drama there are heroes there are villains and the text captivates the attention of some key figures in the in the russian intellectual elite in saint petersburg people like kondraty yirelev who was was executed for his participation in eighteen twenty five uprising writes writes poetry on the basis of this text pushkin pays attention to it as well and then comes along the the key figure in ukrainian national revival of the nineteenth century ukrainian national project tarasovchenko and and reads it as well and they all read them it's very differently eventually by the by the beginning of the of the mid twentieth century some of the russian mostly nationalist writers call this text the quran of ukrainian nationalism so what is what is there the story it's it's it's very important in a sense that what the authors and that's what i claim in the book what the authors of the text were trying to say they were trying to say that the cossack elite should have the same rights as the russian nobility and brings the long historical records to prove how cold the cossacks were over the period of time but in at the beginning of the nineteenth century they put this claim already they use new new arguments and these arguments are about nation and nationalism and they're saying that the cossacks are a separate nation and that's that's a big big big claim the russian empire and this is a very very good argument in historiography that russian empire grew and acquired this one sixth of the earth by using one very specific way of integrating those lands it integrated elites it was making deals with the elites whether the elites were muslim or the elites were roman catholic as the case with the poles they would be elites would be integrated and the empire was made based on that estate the the the state loyalty and the state integration but once you bring in the factor of nation and nationalism and language then once in a sudden the whole model of the integration of the elites irrespective of their language religion and culture starts falling apart and the poles were the first who really produced produced this this sort of a challenge to the russian empire by uprisings two uprisings in the nineteenth century and ukrainians then followed in their footsteps so the text the importance of the text is that it was making claim on the part of a particular estate the cossack officer class which was that empire could survive but it turned it given the conditions of the time into the claim for the special role of cossacks as a nation creating that this is a separate nation a rus' nation and that is the challenge of nationalism that no empire really survived and and the russian empire was not an exception so there's a turning point when the discourse switches from loyalty based on the integration of the elites to the loyalty based on attachment to your nation to your language and to your culture and to your history so that was like the initial spark the flame that led to nationalist movements that was the beginning and the beginning that was building a bridge between the existence of the cossack state in the seventeenth and eighteenth century that was used as a foundation for the cossack mythology ukrainian national mythology went into the ukrainian national anthem and the new age and the new stage where the cossacks were not there anymore where there were professors intellectuals students members of the of the national and and organizations and it started of course with romantic poetry it was started with collect and folklore and then later goes to the to the political stage and eventually the stage of mass politics so to you even throughout the twentieth century under stalin there was always a force within ukraine that wants it to be independent there were five attempts for ukraine to declare its independence and to to maintain it in the in the twentieth century only one succeeded in in nineteen ninety one but there were four four different attempts attempts before and you see the ukrainian national identity manifesting itself in two different in two different ways in the form of national communism after after the bolshevik victory in the in bolshevik controlled ukraine and in the form of radical nationalism in the parts of ukraine that were controlled by poland and and romania and part of that was also controlled by czechoslovakia and and later hungary so in those parts outside of the of the soviet union the the form of the national mobilization the key form of national mobilization became radical nationalism in in soviet ukraine it was national communism that came back in the nineteen sixties and nineteen seventies and then in the nineteen ninety one the the majority of the members of the ukrainian parliament who voted for independence are members of the communist party so that that spirit on on on on certain level never died so there's national communism and radical nationalism well let me ask you about the radical nationalism because that is a topic that comes up in the discussion of the war in ukraine today can you tell me about stepan bandera who was he this controversial far right ukrainian revolutionary there are at least two stepan banderas one is the real person and another is mythology that really comes comes with this name and the real person was a young student missionistically oriented student in the late nineteen twenties and early nineteen thirties in the part of ukraine that was controlled by poland who belong to the generation who regretted that they were not born in time for the big struggles of the of the world war one and and revolution at that time they believed that their fathers lost opportunity and new tactics were not needed so bandara becomes the leader of the organization of ukrainian nationalists in ukraine at the young age and organizes a number of assassinations of the polish officials or members of the ukrainian community who these young people in their seventeen eighteen nineteen considered to be to be collaborators he's arrested put on trial and that's that's where the myth of bandara starts starts to emerge because he uses the trial to make statements about about the ukrainian nationalism radical nationalism and its goals and suddenly becomes becomes a hero among the in the youth ukrainian youth at that time he is sentenced for for execution for death so when he delivers his speech he he knows that he he probably would would die soon and then it was the sentence was commuted to life to to life in prison then world war two happens the polish state collapses under the the pressure coming of course from from nazi germany and the soviet union bandara walks walks away and presides over the act of the split of the organization of ukrainian nationalists into two groups the most radical one you used to call revolutionary they call themselves revolutionary is led by by bandera they worked together with the nazi germany at that time with the hope that nazi germany would deliver them independent ukraine first days of the german attack nazi attack on the soviet union the units formed on the basis of organization of ukrainian nationalists march into the city of lviv and declare ukrainian independence that was not sanctioned by the german authorities that was not in german plans so they arrest bandara members of his family his brothers members of the leaders leaders of the organization so his two brothers go to auschwitz die there he was sent to sachsenhausen for most duration of the of the war until nineteen forty four refusing to revoke declaration of ukrainian independence which again contributes contributes further to his mythology after the war he never comes back to ukraine he lives in exile in munich so between nineteen thirty and his death in nineteen fifty nine he spent in ukraine maybe up to two years maybe a little bit more but most of the time was either in the polish prison or in the in the german concentration camp or in exile but the myth of bandara lived and all the members of the organization of ukrainian nationalists and then the ukrainian insurgent army that fought against the soviets all the way into the early nineteen fifties they were called benderides they were called benderides by the soviet authorities they were known also in that way to the local population so there was a faraway leader that barely was there on the on the spot but whose whose name was attached to this to this movement for really liberation of ukraine at that time again the battle that failed the fact that he collaborated with the nazis sticks from one perspective he's considered by many to be a hero of ukraine for fighting for the independence of ukraine for another perspective coupled with the fact that there's this radical revolutionary extremist flavor to the way he sees the world that label just stays that he's a fascist he's a nazi to what degree is this true to what degree is it not the the this label is certainly promoted by the first by the soviet propaganda and then by russia prop russian propaganda it's it's it works very nicely if you if you focus on the on the years of collaboration those were the same years when joseph stalin collaborated with hitler right so we we we have we have the same the same reason to call stalin stalin nazi collaborator as we have the reason to call bandara nazi collaborator we we look at the at the situation in the pacific in indonesia in other places the leaders who worked together with japanese with the idea of promoting independence of their countries after the japanese collapse become leaders of the empire so the difference with bandara is that he never becomes the leader the leader of empire and and and immunity that that comes with that with that position certainly doesn't apply to him but there there are other parts of his life which certainly certainly put this whole thing in in question the the fate of his family his own time in the german concentration camp certainly don't fit don't fit the the propaganda one one-sided image of bandera in terms of him being a hero that's that's a very very interesting question because he is perceived in ukraine today by not by by by all and probably not by the majority but by many people in ukraine as a symbol of fighting against against the the soviet union and by extension against russia and russian occupation so his popularity grew after february twenty fourth twenty twenty two as a symbol of that resistance again we are talking here about myth and mythology because bandera was not leading the fight against the soviet the the the soviet occupation in in ukraine because at that time he was just simply not in ukraine he was in germany and you can imagine that geography mattered at that time much more than it matters today there's a million questions to ask here i think it's an an important topic because it is at the center of the claimed reason that the war continues in ukraine and so i would like to explore that from from different angles but just to clarify was there a moment where bandera chose nazi germany over the red army when the war already began so in the list of allegiances is ukraine's independence more important than fighting nazi germany essentially the ukrainian independence was their their goal and they were there to to work with anybody who would who would support and and in one way or at least allow the ukrainian independence so the the there is no question that they they are just classic nationalists so the the goal is nationalism is the principle according to which the at least one definition is according to which the cultural boundaries coincide with political boundaries so their goal was to create political boundaries that would coincide with the geographic boundaries in the conditions of the world war two and certainly making making deals with with whoever would would would either support as i said or tolerate that that project of this so i would love to find the line between nationalism even extreme nationalism and fascism and nazism so for bandera the myth and bandera the person to what degree let's look at some of the ideology of nazism to which degree did he hate jews was he antisemitic we know that basically in his circle there were people who were antisemites in a sense that okay we have the texts right we know that we don't have that that information about about or that that sort of tax or that sort of evidence with regards to to bandera himself in terms of fascism there is very clear and there is research done that in particular italian fascist fascism had influence on the on the thinking of people in that organization including people at the top but it is also very important to keep in mind that they call themselves nationalists and revolutionaries and despite the fact that in nineteen thirty nine in nineteen forty in nineteen forty one it was very beneficial for them to declare themselves to be ukrainian fascists and establish this bond with not just with with italy but with nazi germany they refused to do that and then they refused to recall their independence so influences yes but but clearly it's it's it's it's a different it's it's a different type of a political political project so let me fast forward into the future and see to which degree the myth permeates does ukraine have a neo nazi problem my understanding is there are nazis in ukraine and there are there are supporters of white supremacy theories but also my understanding is that they're extremely marginal and they're more marginal than the same sort of groups are in central europe maybe in the us as well and for me the question is not whether the ukraine has it but why even in the conditions of the war the radical nationalism and extremism and and and white supremacists is such a marginal force when in the countries that are not at the war this is this you you look you look at france you look at again it's it's it's not exactly nasa's but really right radical right is is becoming so important why why in the conditions of the war is the country that manages relations between different ethnic groups and languages in the way that strengthens political nation so for me as a scholar and a researcher what i see is that in ukraine the the influence of the far right in different in different variations is much lower than it is among among some of ukraine's neighbors and in europe in general and the question is why i i don't know i have guesses i i i don't know answer but that's that's the the the the the that's the question that i think is interesting to answer how how ukraine ended up to be the only country in the world outside of israel who has a jewish president who is my at least understanding is the the most popular president in history in terms of how long his popularity goes after the election so this these are the the really from my point of view interesting interesting questions and again we we can we can certainly debate that so just for context the the the most popular far right party won two point one five percent of the vote in twenty nineteen this is before the war so that's where things stood it's unclear where they stand now it'd be an interesting question whether it escalated and how much what you're saying is that war in general can serve as a catalyst for expansion of extremist groups of extremist nationalistic groups especially like the far right and it's interesting to see to what degree they have or have not risen to power in the sort of in the shadows so no nationalist or nationalistic party actually crossed the the barrier to get into the parliament yeah so ukraine is the country where there is no right or far right in the parliament we we can't say that about germany we can't say that about france so that's that's just one more way to to to to stress this unique unique place of ukraine in that in that sense and the year twenty nineteen is the year already of the war the war started in twenty fourteen with the annexation of the crimea the the the front line was near donbas all these groups were fighting there so ukraine maybe not to a degree that it is now was already on the on the war footing and yet and yet the the the the the right party couldn't couldn't get more than two percent so that's that's the question that i have in mind and yes the war historically historically of course puts forward and and makes from the the more nationalist views and forces turn them from marginal forces into more central ones we talked about bandera and we talked about organization of ukrainian nationalists they were the most marginal group in the political spectrum in ukraine in the nineteen thirties that one can only imagine but world war two comes and they become the most central group because they also were from the start go they knew that they had the organization the the the violence was basically one of their means they knew how to fight so historically historically wars indeed produce the those results so we are we are looking at ukraine we are we are trying to see what is happening there so vladimir putin in his interview with tucker carlson but many times before said that the current goal for the war in ukraine is denazification that the purpose of the war is denazification can you explain this concept of denazification as putin sees it denazification is the trope that is accepted quite well by the by the former soviet population and russian population in particular the the most powerful mythology soviet mythology that then was basically passed as as part of heritage to the to the russian federation was world war two was fighting against fascism so once you use terms fascism and nazi indemnification suddenly suddenly people not just start listening they just stop analyzing and as a as a propaganda tool this is this is of course very very powerful tool in terms of to what degree this is this is the real goal or not we discussed the the importance of the far right in in in europe and and in ukraine so if that's the real goal of the war probably the war would have to start not against ukraine but probably against france or some other country if you take this at face value there's something really interesting here as you mentioned because i've spoken to a lot of people in russia and you said analysis stops in the west people look at the word denazification and look at the things we've just discussed and kinda almost think this this is absurd when you talk to people in russia maybe it's deep in there somewhere the history of world war two still reverberates through the maybe the fears maybe the pride whatever the deep emotional history is there it seems that the goal of denazification appears to be reasonable for people in russia they don't seem to see the absurdity or the complexity or the or even the need for analysis i guess in this kind of statement word of denazification i would say this is broader this is broader the the war that started under the banner that russians and ukrainians were one and the same people and produces that sort of casualty really goes against also some any sort of logical of of logical thinking but the russia is a place where the free press doesn't exist already for a long period of time russia is the place where there is an echo chamber to a degree and as war started first in twenty fourteen and then all out war in twenty twenty two i came across a lot of people on the personal level but also in the media reporting that they really can't find common language with their close relatives in in russia people who visited ukraine who know that it is not taken over by by nationalists and is not taken over by nazis but the the media around them the neighbors around them the people at their work basically say one and the same thing and we as humans in general what whatever our background we are very very our mind is is really it's it's relatively easy to manipulate it and to a degree that even family connections even family ties don't sometimes help to to to maintain that that ability to to think and and to analyze on your own to look at at the facts so putin has alluded to the yaroslav hanke incident in the canadian parliament september twenty twenty three this man is a veteran of world war two on the ukrainian side and he got two standing ovations in the canadian parliament but they later found out that he was part of the ss so can you explain on this what are your thoughts on this this had a very big effect on the narrative i guess propagated throughout the region yes what what happened during world war two was that once the germans started to run out of of manpower they created sort of foreign legion groups but because those people were not aryans they they were created for fighting on the on the on the battle grounds because they were not aryans they couldn't be trusted so they were put under the command of henry himmler under command of ss and became known as sswafn units and one of such units was created in ukraine with great difficulties because nazis didn't consider slavs to be generally worthy of even even that sort of foreign legion formations but they made an exception because those people were coming from galicia which was part of austria hungary which means part of austria which means somehow we're open to the benevolent influence of the of the germanic of the germanic race and called called the the division galitzen or galicia part of of ukrainian youth joined the galits the the division the one of the explanations was that they were looking at the experience of world war one and seeing that the units the ukrainian units in the austrian army then played a very important role in the fight for independence so that is one of the explanations you can't just use one explanation to to to describe motivations of everyone and every single person who who was joining there so they were sent to the front they were defeated within a few few short days by the by the by the red army and then were were retreating through through slovakia where they were used to fight with the partisan movement there and eventually surrendered to the british so that's that's the story you can personally maybe understand what what what the the good motivations for this person or that person but that is one of the the best one of the very tragic and and and unfortunate pages in in in in ukrainian history you you can't you can't justify that as as as as as a phenomenon so from that point of view the the celebration of that experience as opposed to looking at that okay that that happened and we wish that those young men who were idealistic or joined the division for idealistic purposes had had had better understanding of things or made other choices but you can't you can't certainly certainly celebrate it and and once that happened that of course became a big a big propaganda a propaganda item in in in in the current war we are talking about about ten to twenty thousand people in the division and we are talking about two to three million ukrainians fighting in the red army and again it's it's not like red army is is is is is completely blameless in the way how it behaved in in in prussia in germany and so on and so forth but it's basically it's it's again we are going back to the story of bandera so there is a period of collaboration and that's that's what propaganda tries to define him by or there is a division the leads by twenty thousand people and somehow it makes irrelevant the experience of two to three million people i mean just to clarify i think there is just a blunder on the canadian parliament side the canadian side of not doing research of maybe correct me if i'm wrong but from my understanding they were just doing stupid shallow political stuff let's applaud you know when zelensky shows up let's have a ukrainian veteran let's applaud a veteran of world war two and then all of a sudden you realize well there's actually complexities to wars we can talk about for example a lot of dark aspects on all sides of world war two the mass rape at the end of world war two by the the red army when they say marched over germany there's a lot of really dark complexity in it on all sides so you know that could be an opportunity to explore the dark complexity that some of the ukrainians were in the ss or bandera the the complexities there but i think they were doing not a complex thing they were doing a very shallow applaud and we should applaud veterans of course but in that case they were doing it for show for zelensky and so on so we should clarify that the applause wasn't knowing it wasn't for the ss it was for a ukrainian it was for world war two veterans but the propaganda or at least an interpretation from the russian side from whatever side is that they were applauding the full person standing before them which wasn't just a ukrainian veteran but ukrainian veteran that fought for the ss i don't have any particular insights but i would be very much surprised if even one person in the parliament i mean the members of the parliament actually knew the whole story i would be very surprised yeah the whole story of this person and frankly the whole story of ukraine and russia in world war two period yes nevertheless it had a lot of power and really reverberated in support of the narrative that there is a neo nazi a nazi problem in ukraine this is the the the narrative that is out there and it's it's especially powerful in russia it's especially powerful in russia given that there are really the the the the the the the atmosphere that that that is created really is not conducive to any to any independent analysis well i wonder what is the most effective way to respond to that particular claim because there could be a discussion about nationalism and extreme nationalism and the fight for independence and whether it isn't like putin wrote one people but the question of are there nazis in ukraine seems to be a question that could be analyzed rigorously with data that is being done on the academic level but in terms of the of the public response and public discourse the the only response that i see is not to focus on the on the questions raised and and put by the propaganda because you already become victim of that propaganda by definition but talk about that much broadly and and talk about about different different aspects of or if it is world war two about different aspects of world war two if it's about issue of the far right in ukraine let's talk about us let's talk about russia let's talk about france let's compare that's the only way how you deal with propaganda because propaganda is not necessarily something that is is an outright lie it can be just one factor that's taken out of the context and and is is blown out of proportion and that's that that that is good enough and the way to defend against that is to bring in the context let us move gracefully throughout back and forth through history back to bandera you wrote a book on the kgb spy bogdan stashinsky can you tell his story this is a story of the history of the organization of ukrainian nationalists and and bandara as well already after the end of the second world war mhmm because what you got after the second world war so imagine may of nineteen forty five the red banner is all over riksdag the red army is in control of half of europe but the units of the red army are still fighting the war and not just behind the soviet lines but within the borders of the soviet union and this war continues all the way into the early nineteen fifties up to almost up to stalin's death the war is conducted by the organization of ukrainian nationalists which have a ukrainian insurgent army and the government tries to crush that resistance so what it does is basically recruits local people to to spy on the partisans on the underground and bodenstashinsky is one of those people his family is supporting the resistance they provide food his his sister is engaged with one of the local commanders of the of this underground unit and they know everything about stashinsky's family and they know everything about him because he is also collecting funds for the underground so they have a conversation with him saying that okay that's that's what we got and you and your family can go to to prison or you help us a little bit we we are interested in the fiance of your sister and we want to get him and stasinski says yes and once once they round up the the fiancee he basically betrayed a member or almost member of his family he's he's done he can't go back to to to his village he can't go back to his study he was studying in lviv at that time so he becomes as i write in my book the the secret police becomes his family and he is sent to kyiv he's trained for two years sent to east germany into berlin and becomes becomes an assassin so they sent him across the across the border to to western germany to munich he was the headquarter of different different organizations anti soviet organizations ukrainian and then russian and then georgian and so on and so forth and he kills he kills two leaders of the of the organization of ukrainian nationalists one editor of the newspaper and eventually he kills bandara he does that with the new weapon a spray pistol that eventually makes it into the bond novel the man with the golden gun and that whole episode is a little bit reshaped but it is it it is not in the film but it is in the in the novel itself and dan later has a change of mind under the influence of his german german fiancee and then and then wife they decide to escape to the west and while they're doing that they discover that their apartment was bugged and probably the kgb knows all of that so a long story short his son dies in in berlin it should be doesn't allow him to go there but his wife has a nervous breakdown so they allow him to go there to just calm her so that there would be no scandal and two of them one day before their son's burial because that's after after that they would be sent to moscow they jump the ship and go to west berlin two hours before the berlin wall was being built so they they they you if they would stay for the funeral probably they would the kgb would not let them go but also if they would stay the the the the water would be there and he goes he goes to the american intelligence and says okay that's that's who i am and that's what i did and they look at him and they say we don't trust you we don't know who you are you have documents and five names you say you killed bandera oh we have a different information he was he was poisoned and probably by someone in his in in his in his close in his close circle a spray pistol did did did you reach too much ian fleming mhmm where does this come from mhmm he insists they said okay you insist if you committed all those crimes we're giving you to the german police and german police will be will be investigating you and then the trial comes and if he says if he takes back his testimony the whole case against him collapses he can go free he knows that if he goes free he is a target of his colleagues from from from the same department so his task at the trial is to prove that he is guilty that he's did that mhmm and then he disappears nobody knows where he goes and there are all sorts of cover stories and i was lucky to interview a commander for former chief of the of the south african police who confirmed to me that staszynski was in south africa he fled the the west german intelligence thought that it was too dangerous for him to stay in germany they sent him under under a different name to to south africa so that's that's that's the story of stasinski himself but going back to bandara of course the fact that he confessed and it became known that kgb assassinated bandara that added to the to the image and and to to general mythology about bandara what a fascinating story of a village boy becoming an assassin who killed one of the most influential revolutionaries of the region in the twentieth century so what just zooming out broadly on the kgb how powerful was the kgb what role did it play in this whole story of the soviet union it depends on the period at the time that we just described late fifties and early sixties they were not powerful at all and the reasons for that was that people like khrushchev were really concerned about the secret police becoming too powerful it became too powerful in their mind under stalin and dabirya and it was concern about the beria's power as a secret police chief that led to the coup against beria and khrushchev come come into power and beria was arrested and executed and what what khrushchev was trying to do after that was trying to put since fifty four the name was already kgb kgb under his control so he was appointed the former comsol leaders as the heads of the kgb so the people who really really owed everything to him that that sort of position and the heads of the kgb were not members of it changed it changed in the seventies with andropo where kgb started started to play again very important role in in the soviet history and let's say decisions on afghanistan and the soviet troops marching into afghanistan were made by the apart from brezhnev by the trio of the people who are not would be called today maybe or not all of them were but one of course was on drop of the head of the kgb another was the minister of defense and and then there was secretary in charge of the military industrial complex the ministry of minister of foreign affairs so but but the head of the kgb became really not just the member of politburo but the the the the the member of that inner circle and then the fact that andropov succeeds brezhnev is also a manifestation of of the power that kgb acquired really after after khrushchev in the in the nineteen seventies and then going into the nineteen eighties who was more powerful the kgb or the cia during the soviet union the cia it's it's the organization that is charged with the information gathering and all sorts of operations including assassinations in the in the fifties and sixties abroad the kgb was the organization that really had both the surveillance over the population within the soviet union and and and also the the operations abroad and its members its leaders were members of the inner circle for for making decisions i again from what i understand about the way how how politics and decision work and decisions are made in in the united states the the cia the chief of the cia is not is is not one of the decision making group that that provide an information yes so so i would say it's not day and night but their power political influence political significance very different is it understood how big the kgb was how widespread it was given its secretive and distributed nature certain things we know others we don't because the stasi archives are open and and most of the kgb especially in moscow they're not but we know that the kgb combined not only the internal sort of a secret police functions at home and counter counterintelligence branch and intelligence branch abroad but also the the border troops for example right so really institutionally it was it was it was a huge huge mammoth and another thing that we know we can sort of extrapolate from what we know from the stasi from the stasi archives that the surveillance at home the surveillance was really massive the gas is the the the the soviets were not as effective and as as meticulous and as scrupulous and as methodical as probably as germans were but that that gives you that that gives you a basic idea of how how penetrated the entire society was what do you think is important to understand about the kgb if we want to also understand vladimir putin since he was a kgb foreign intelligence officer stashevsky what what i understand is that in kgb and it was a powerful organization again less powerful in fifties and sixties but still very powerful organization there was there was on the one hand the understanding of the situation in the country and abroad that probably other other organizations didn't have they had also first peak in terms of the selecting cadres the the the work in the kgb was well paid and considered to be very prestigious so that's the so that was part to a degree of the soviet elite in terms of whom they whom they recruited and they had a resentment toward the party leadership that didn't allow them to do james bond kind of things that they would want to do because they were political risks after this scandal with stashinsky the at least on on many levels the kgb stopped the the practice of the assassinations political assassinations abroad because it was considered politically to be extremely extremely dangerous the person who was in charge of the kgb at the time of bandera's assassination shlepkin was one of the candidates to replace khrushchev and brezhnev used against him that scandal abroad eventually to remove him from politburo so the kgb was really was really looking at the party leadership as to a degree ineffective corrupt and was on their way and from what i understand that's that's exactly the the the the attitudes that people like like putin and and and people of his circle brought brought to to power in kremlin so the methods that kgb use they can use now and there is no no party or no no other other institution actually stopping them from doing that and they think about my understanding the the operations abroad about foreign policy in general in terms of the kgb mindset of planning operations and executing particular operations and so on and so forth so i think a lot a lot of culture that came into existence in the soviet kgb now became part of the culture of the of the russian russian establishment you wrote the book the russo ukrainian war the return of history that gives the full context leading up to the invasion of ukraine by russia in february twenty twenty two so can you take me through the key moments in history that led up to this war so we'll mention the collapse of the soviet union we could probably go much farther back but the collapse of the soviet union mentioned twenty fourteen maybe you can highlight key moments that led up to the to twenty twenty two the key moments would be first the year two zero four known for orange revolution in in ukraine and then the year twenty thirteen known as the revolution of dignity both were the revolts against the something that by significant part of ukrainian population was considered to be completely completely unacceptable actions on the part of the government and people in the government at that time so the orange revolution of two zero four was a protest against falsified presidential elections and rejection of a candidate that was supported by russia public was supported by russia i remember being in moscow at that time and couldn't believe my eyes when in the center of russia i saw a billboard with yanukovych the the trick was that there were a lot of ukrainians in in russia and in moscow in particular and they they had the right to vote so and it led to the election of ukraine as ukrainian president viktor yushchenko who put on the on the agenda the issue of ukraine's membership in nato so it was very clear pro western orientation and the second case was the revolution of dignity twenty thirteen with some of the same characters including yanukovych who at that time was already president of ukraine and there the question was of the government promising the people for one year at least to sign association agreement with european union and then turning over almost overnight and saying that they were not going to do that and that's that's how things started but then when they became really massive and why something that was called revolution euro revolution became revolution of dignity was when the government police beat up students in downtown kyiv who judging by the reports were basically already almost ready to to disperse almost ready to go home and that's when roughly half of kyiv showed up on the streets that sort of the police behavior that sort of the was absolutely unacceptable in ukraine the the still in elections and falsification of elections was unacceptable that's where around that time and around two zero four the president of ukraine at that time leonid kuchma writes a book called ukraine is not russia and apparently the term comes from his his discussion with putin when putin was suggesting to him quite strongly to use force against people on the maidan on the square in kyiv and kuchma allegedly said to him you don't understand ukraine is not russia you can't you can't do things like that you get you get pushback and that's that's the these two events to four and then twenty thirteen became really crucial point in terms of the ukraine direction the the survival of ukrainian democracy which is one of very few countries in the post soviet space where democracy survived the original flirt with between the government leaders and and democracy of the nineteen nineties it was the also a story in russia everywhere else there was high democratic expectations but they came pretty much to an end by the end of the decade ukraine ukraine preserved the democracy and the orientation of ukraine toward toward integration into in some form into western and european structures that that ukrainian democracy plus western orientation was something and in russia we see the strengthening of the autocratic regime under vladimir putin that if you look deeper the the these are the processes that put the two countries on the collision course so there's a division a push and pull inside ukraine on identity whether they're part of russia or part of europe and you highlighted two moments in ukrainian history that there's a big flare up where the the statement was first ukraine is not russia and essentially ukraine is part of europe but there's other moments mhmm what were the defining moments that began an actual war in the donbas the the the the war started in february of twenty fourteen with the russian takeover of crimea by military force right the the so called green man and the big question is is why and it's it's very important to go back to the year twenty thirteen and the the start of the of the protests and the the story of the ukraine signing association agreement with european union so from what we understand today the ukrainian government under president yanukovych did this suicidal sharp turn after one year of promising association agreement saying that okay we changed our mind under pressure from moscow and moscow applied that pressure for one reason at least in my opinion the ukraine signed an association agreement with european union would mean that ukraine would not be able to sign association agreement with any eurasian union in any shape or form that that was at that time in the process of making and for vladimir putin that was the beginning of his or part of of his third term one of his agenda items for the third term was really consolidation of the of the post soviet space and eurasian space and not membership in nato not membership in european union but association agreement with european union meant that that post soviet space would have to exist under moscow's control but without ukraine the second largest post soviet republic the republic on whose vote depended the continuing existence of the soviet union and whose vote ended in in many ways the existence of the soviet union so that is that is broadly background but but also there are of course personalities there are also also their beliefs the the the readings of history and and and all of that became became part of the story but if if you look at that geopolitically the the association agreement is putting putting ukraine outside of the russian sphere of influence and the the the response was an attempt to topple topple the government in kyiv that clearly was going to to sign that that agreement to take over crimea and to help to deal with a lot of issues within russia itself and boost the the the popularity of of the president and it certainly certainly worked in that in that way as well and the once once ukraine still after crimea continued on its path then the next step started the so called hybrid warfare in donbas but again the the unlike unlike crimea from what from what i understand russia was not really looking forward to taking possession of donbas donbas was viewed as the way how to influence ukraine to stop it from drift toward the west maybe you can tell me about the region of donbas i mentioned that nationalism and principle of nationalism is the principle of making the political borders to coincide with ethnic and cultural borders and that's that's how the maps of of many east european countries had been drawn in the nineteenth and twentieth century on that on that principle donbas where the majority constituted by the beginning of the twentieth century where ukrainians was considered to be ukrainian and was claimed in the middle in in in the middle of this revolution and revolutionary wars and civil wars by ukrainian government but donbas became a site one of the key sites in the russian empire of early industrialization and it's this is mining industry this is mythological industry so what that meant was that people from other parts of not ukraine but other parts of the russian empire congregated there that's that's where jobs were that's how khrushchev and his family came came to donbas the family of brezhnev overshoot a little bit they got to the industrial enterprises in in in the city of kamensk near near dnipro the the place the city that was called dnipropetrovsk so those were russian peasants moving into the area in in looking for the for the for the job and by the the the population became quite mixed ukrainians still constituted the majority of the population but not necessarily in the towns and in the cities and culturally the place was becoming more and more russian as the result of that of that moment so apart from the crimea donbas was the part of ukraine where the ethnic russians were the the the biggest group they were not the majority but they were very very big and significant group for example in the city of mariupol that was all but destroyed in the course of the last of the last two years the ethnic russians constituted over forty percent of the population right so that's not exactly part of donbas but that gives you that that gives you general idea now the story of donbas and what happened now is multidimensional and the satin composition is just one part of the story another very important part of the story is economy and donbas is a classical rust belt and we know what happens with the cities that were part of the first or second wave of industrialization in the united states and globally you know about social problems that exist in those places so donbas is probably the most dramatic and tragic case of the rust belt with the mines not anymore producing the sort of the and at the acceptable price the coal that they used to produce is people look losing jobs with the politicians looking for subsidies as opposed to trying very unpopular unpopular measures of dealing something and and bring bring new money and new investment russia for russia for the russian federation to destabilize the situation we have interviews with mister girkin who is saying that he was the first who pulled the trigger and and fired the shot in in that war he became the minister of defense in the in the donetsk people's republic you look at the prime minister he's another person with moscow residency permit so you you see key figures in in those positions at the start and the beginning not being russians from ukraine but being being russians from russia and russians russians from moscow closely connected to the to the government structure and intelligence structure and so on so that is that is the start and the beginning but the the way how how it exploded the way it did was also a combination of of the economic and and ethnocultural and and linguistic factors so for putin the war in donbas and even in twenty twenty two is a defensive war against what the ukrainian government is doing against ethnically russian people of donbas is that fair to say well how he describes it what what we see the this is certainly this is certainly the argument right this is certainly the argument and a pretext because what we see there is that there would be no and and there was no independent mobilization in crimea either in crimea or in donbas without russian presence without russian occupation de facto of the crimea there would be no and and there was no before at least in the previous five to six years any mass mobilizations of russians there was none of such mobilizations in in donbas before before gherkin and other people with military with with parts of military units showed up there so it is it is it is an excuse you you've been to ukraine mhmm you know that russian language is not prosecuted in ukraine and if you've not been to donbas it would be diff or to the crimea it would be difficult to find one single ukrainian school not that they didn't exist at all but it would take quite an effort mhmm for you to find it or sometimes even to hear ukrainian language outside either of the institutions or or the or the farmers market so that's that's that's the reality that that's the reality that is clear that is visible so imagine under those conditions and context that someone is is persecuting ethnic russians or russian speakers one to believe in something like that one important precondition is never to step step your foot in ukraine i should mention maybe this is a good moment to mention when i traveled to ukraine this is after the start of the war i you mentioned farmers market which is funny basically every single person i talked to including the leadership we spoke in russian for many of them russian is the more comfortable language even and the people who spoke ukrainian are more on the west's western side of ukraine and you know young people that are kinda willing to show that in an activist way that they want to fight for the independence of their country so i take your point i wonder if you wanna comment about language and maybe about the future of language in ukraine is is the future of language going to stabilize on ukrainian or is it going to return to its traditional base of russian language very roughly before the start of the war in twenty fourteen we can talk about parity between russian and ukrainian and also with as you said clearly ukraine being a dominant language in the west and russian being being a dominant language on the streets certainly in the in the east of the country and then in between of that to pause a number of these transitional areas and ukraine in my experience and i i visited a lot of countries not all of them and probably maybe maybe i will be still surprised but in my experience this is the only truly bilingual country that i ever visited i lived in canada for a long period of time the risk were back in the rest and and and and in ukraine you you can talk in either russian or ukrainian in any part of the of the country and you would be understood and you would be responded in in a different language with the expectation that you would would understand and if you if you don't understand that means you don't come from ukraine that's the reality the war and loss of the crimea and partial loss of donbas of its major major industrial industrial areas really shifted the balance toward mostly ukrainian speaking reasons regions and also what you see and you you clearly pointed to that starting with twenty fourteen even a little bit earlier the younger generation chooses chooses ukrainian as as a marker of its identity and that started in twenty fourteen but we we we have a dramatic dramatic shift after twenty twenty two and on the anecdotal anecdotal level i can tell you that i i speak to people who be in in in chernihiv at the time this is east of of crimea at the time of of the russian aggression and bombardment and so on and so forth who had passive knowledge of ukrainian but spoke all their all their life russian and they would speak ukrainian to me and then when i say okay why are you doing that we we know each other for decays in the us russian and he said oh i don't want to have anything in common with people who did that to us so there is the the there is a big big push of course with this with this current war now the question is whether this change is is something that will stay or not what is what is the future linguistic practices are very very conservative ones and we at the harvard ukrainian research institute have a project called mapa digital atlas of ukraine and we were documenting and mapping different data in time and what we noticed a spike in the people self reporting of use of ukrainian in twenty fourteen and twenty fifteen at the time of the start of the war when the the the the the threat was the most clear one this is self reporting that doesn't mean that people exactly do what what but they believe that that's what that they are supposed to do and then return back to where it was by the year twenty sixteen and twenty seventeen so this dynamic can repeat itself but given the how long the war is going on how big the impact is how big the stress is and that the the the way the wave of the future is probably associated with younger people who are switching to ukrainians so i would i would my bet would be on on on ukrainian language rising in prominence so as we get closer to february of twenty twenty two there's a few other key moments maybe let's talk about in july twenty twenty one putin publishing an essay titled on the historical unity of russians and ukrainians can you describe the ideas expressed in this essay the idea is is very conveniently presented already in the first paragraph in the first sentences really of the article where putin says that for a long time i was saying that russians and ukrainians were one and the same people and here is the proof this is this is the the the the the the the historical he he develops his historical argumentation apparently with the help of of of of of a lot of people around him and he started to talk about russians and ukrainians being one and the same people one year before the start of the war in twenty fourteen so in twenty thirteen he was together with patriarch kirill on visit to kyiv and there was a conference specifically organized for him in the kievan caves monastery and that's that's where he he he stated that the the the fact that he was with is is very important factor for understanding where the idea is coming from this is the idea that was dominant in the russian empire of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century that russians ukrainians and belarusians are really russian great russians little russians and white russians and that they constitute one one people yes there are some dialectical differences yes ukrainians sing well yes they they they dance funny but overall that's that's that that doesn't matter and the that idea actually was really destroyed mostly destroyed by the revolution of nineteen seventeen because it wasn't just social revolution that's how it is understood in in in in us and good part of the world it was also national revolution it was an empire it was a revolution in the in the russian empire and to bring these pieces of empire back within the soviet union the bolsheviks had to make concessions one of those concessions was to recognition of the existence of ukrainians as a separate nation belarusians as a separate nations russians as a separate nations endowing them with their own territorial with borders with institutions and so on and so forth but there was one institution that was not reformed that institution was called the russian orthodox church because one of the ways that bolsheviks dealt with it they couldn't eradicate religion completely but they arrested the development of the of of of the religion and thinking and and and and theology on the level as it existed before the revolution of nineteen seventeen so the russian orthodox church of nineteen seventeen continued to be the russian orthodox church in nineteen in nineteen ninety one and in twenty thirteen continuing the same imperial mantra of the existence of one big russian nation one unified people and when you see the formation of of the ideas about about nations about foreign policy in the russian empire after nineteen ninety one they're going back to the pre pre bolshevik times ukrainians do that as well estonians do that as well the difference is that when ukrainians go back they go back to the pre nineteen seventeen their their intellectual fathers and and writings of basically liberal nationalism or sometimes they go to the radical nationalism of bandara which would be which would be not pre nineteen seventeen but pre nineteen forty five when the russians go to pre bolshevik past looking for the ideas looking for inspiration looking for the narratives what they find there is empire what they find there are imperial projects and and that's that's that's certainly the story of the of the putin's claim that's the story of the argument and to to conclude the argument that he lays out there historical argument comes also almost directly from the narratives of the late nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century so it's not only the argument is coming from that era but also the argumentation is is coming from that era as well but that those arguments are all in in the flavor of empire it's empire on the one hand but also there is imperial understanding of what russian nation is that doesn't allow for independence of its little russian and white russian branches alleged branches right so what what you see with the concept of the big russian nation that's late nineteenth beginning twentieth century empire sees the writing on the wall that nationalism is on the rise and it tries to survive by mobilizing the nationalism of the largest group in the empire which happens to be russian stalin is a big promoter of the some form of russian nationalism especially during the war and after war and he started his career as a very promising georgian writer writing in georgia yeah so he's not doing that for some personal personal affinity or cultural intellectual roots within within rush within russian nation or russian people he is doing that for the for the sake of the success of the of his soviet and communist project and he he he has to get the largest ethnic group on board which are which are russians but but stalin and and and putin have different understanding who russians are stalin stalin already accepted ukrainians and belarusians their existence putin putin goes back back to pre stalin and pre lenin times so if we step back from the the historical context of this and maybe the geopolitical purpose of writing such an essay and forget about the essay altogether you know i have family in ukraine and russia i know a lot of people in ukraine and russia forget the war forget all of this there's a kinda they all kinda sound the same like if i go to france they sound different than in ukraine and russia like if you lay out this the cultural map of the world there's just a different beat and music and flavor to a people the i guess what i'm trying to say is there seems to be a closeness between the cultures of ukraine and russia like how do we describe that do we acknowledge that and how does that add tension with the national independence first of all especially when it comes to eastern ukraine or to the big cities many people in ukraine spoke russian right mhmm generally it's it's the same language on the top of that we started our discussion with talking about the slavs right so both ukrainian and russian language are slavic languages so there is there is proximity there as well on the top of that there is a history of existence in the soviet union and before that in one empire for a long period of time so you see a lot of a lot of before the war a lot of ukrainian singers and entertainers performing in russia and vice versa and biography of president zelenskyy certainly one of the fits fits that that that particular particular model as well that that all talks about about similarities but these similarities also very often obscure things that that became so important in the course of this war and i already mentioned the book titled by by by president kuzma of ukraine ukraine is not russia so that's that's the argument despite the fact that you think that we are the same we behave differently and it turned out that they behave differently you have in in moscow and police violence and that's the end of it you have the maidan in ukraine and you have police violence and that's that's the beginning that's not the end history really matters in in the way why why sometimes peep people speaking the same language with different accents behave very different russia and russian identity was formed around the state and has difficulty imagining itself outside of the state and that state happened to be imperial for most of russian history ukrainian project came into existence in revolt against the state ukraine came into existence out of the parts of different empires which means they left different cultural impact on them and for ukrainians to stay together autocratic regime so far didn't work it's like the colonies of the united states you have to you have to find common language you you have to talk to each other and that became part of the ukrainian political dna and that that became a huge factor in the war and very few people in ukraine believed what what vladimir putin was saying that russians and ukrainians were one and the same people but the majority believed that they're certainly close culturally and historically nations and from that point of view the bombardment of the ukrainian cities became such a shock to the ukrainians because deep down they they maybe looked at syria they looked at chechnya and were explaining that through the fact that there was basically such a big cultural gap and difference between russians and and and those those countries and those nations but i i i my understanding at least most of them had difficulty imagining the war of that proportion and that that sort of ferocity and that sort of war crimes the the the bringing that that that sort of war crimes in on that level so it's interesting that you said that in the dna of ukraine versus russia so maybe russia is more conducive to authoritarian regimes and ukraine is more conducive to defining itself by rebelling against authoritarian regimes by rebellion absolutely and that was the story pretty much before nineteen ninety one so what you see since nineteen ninety one and what you see today is i would say new factor certainly in ukrainian modern history because ukrainians traditionally were very successful rebels the largest peasant army in the civil war in the russian empire was the mahkma army in southern ukraine and one one revolt cossack revolts and other revolts one after another but ukrainians had historically difficulty actually maintaining the sort of freedom that they acquired had difficulty associating themselves with the state and what we see especially in the last two years it's it's a quite phenomenal development in ukraine when ukrainians associate themselves with the state where ukrainians see a state not just as a foreigner as historically it was in ukrainian history not just someone who came to to take but the state that is continuation of them that helps to provide security for them that the the the ukrainian armed forces even before the start of this war had the the highest highest support and popularity in in ukraine the state today functions unbelievably effectively under attacks and missile attacks and against city government and local government and it's it's it's we we are witnessing when it comes to ukraine we are witnessing a very important historical development where ukrainians found their state for the first time through through most through most of it their history and try to make a transition from successful rebels to successful managers and state builders yeah i talked to john mearsheimer recently there there's a lot of people that believe nato had a big contribution to the russian invasion of ukraine in twenty twenty two what role did nato play in this full history from bucharest in two thousand and eight to today nato was a big part certainly of the russian justification for the war that was the theme that was up there in the months leading to the to the aggression the truth is that and vladimir putin went on records saying that that the western leaders were telling him again and again that there is no chance for ukraine to become a member of nato anytime soon russia was very effective back in the year two zero eight in stopping ukraine and georgia on the path of joining nato there was a bucharest summit at which the us president at that time george w bush was pushing for the membership and putin convinced leaders of france and germany to block that that membership and after that membership for ukraine and for georgia was really removed from the from the realistic agenda for nato and that's that's what the leaders of the western world in the month leading to the february twenty twenty two aggression were trying to to convey to vladimir putin what he wanted there was an ultimatum that really was there to not to start negotiations but really to stop negotiations he demanded the withdrawal of nato to the borders of the nineteen ninety seven if i if i'm not mistaken so completely something that neither leaders would accept nor the country's members of nato would accept but for me it's very clear that that was that that was an excuse that that was a justification and what happened later in the year twenty twenty two and twenty twenty three certainly confirms me in that in that belief finland joined nato and sweden is on the way to joining nato so finland joining nato increased border between russia and nato twofold and probably more than that so if nato is the real concern it would be probably not completely unreasonable to expect that if not every single soldier but at least half of the russian army fighting in ukraine would be moved to protect the new border with nato in finland so i have no doubt that no one in kremlin either in the past or today looks favorably or is excited about nato take nato moving or the countries of eastern europe joining nato but i have very difficult time imagining that that was the primary cause of the war and what we see also we talked about tucker's interview he was surprised but he believed that putin was completely honest when the first twenty five minutes of interview he was talking about relations between russia and ukraine he was talking about history and that was also the main focus of his essay essay was not on nato and russia his essay was on russia and ukraine so that is where the the the real causes are the broader context is the fall of empire and process of disintegration of empire not the story of nato what was to clarify the reason putin russia invaded ukraine in twenty twenty two the immediate goal in twenty fourteen when the war started was to stop the drift of ukraine toward the west and outside of the russian sphere of influence the invasion of twenty twenty two perceived the same the same goals keeping ukraine in the russian sphere of influence once we have the resistance quite effective resistance on the part of ukraine the rammstein and coalition international coalition in support of ukraine then we see the realization of plan b where parts of ukrainian territory are being annexed and included in the constitution of the russian federation so the two scenarios don't exclude each other but if if scenario number one doesn't work then scenario number two goes goes into play in the gates of kiev chapter you write about volodymyr zelensky in the early days of the war what are most important moments to you about this time the the first hours and days of the invasion the first hours and the first days were the most difficult psychologically the rest of the world really didn't expect kyiv to last for more than a few days didn't expect ukraine to last for more than a few weeks and all the data suggested that that's what would happen ukraine would collapse would be taken over putin called his his war a special military operation which suggests you also expectations about the scope expectations about the time so semi military semi police police operation so every reasonable person in the world believed that that would would happen and it's the heroism of quote unquote unreasonable people like zelensky like the commander of ukrainian armed forces zaluzhny like mayors of the city klitschko and others i'm just naming names that are familiar to to almost all of us now but there are thousands of those people unreasonable people who decided that it was unreasonable to attack their country and that that that was that was the most the most difficult times and days and speaking about zelensky every i understand reasonable leader in the west was trying to convince him to leave ukraine and to set a government in exile in in poland or in london and it was reasonable to accept his one of his predecessors mister yanukovych fledcave a few months before that in afghanistan the president of afghanistan fled afghanistan that was a reasonable thing to expect and he turned out to be very very unreasonable in that in that sense that's that comes with the guts his guts and guts people around him and and ukrainians in general why do you think he stayed in kyiv this former comedian who played a president on tv when kiev is being invaded by the second most powerful military in the world because i think he believes in things and and and one of of those things was that if he president and he is in the presidential office he is there to play his role to that and another thing my personal again i never met volodymyr zelensky my personal understanding of him is that he is has talent that helped him in his career before the presidency and then helps now he fills the audience and then channels the the the the attitude of the audience and and amplifies it and i think that another reason why he didn't leave kyiv was that he failed the audience the audience in that in that particular context for the ukrainians so he had a sense that the ukrainians would unify because he was quite if you look at the polls before the war quite unpopular and and there was a still divisions and factions and the government is divided i mean there there's the east and the west and all this kind of stuff you you think he had a sense that this could unite people the east and the west was not already such an issue after after crimea and part of donbas being gone so ukraine was much more united than it was before he brought to power his before that really nonexistent party of regions on his personal popularity but the important thing is that he created a majority in the parliament which really reflected the unity that existed among ukrainians that didn't was not there before he won with seventy three percent of the population of of of those who took part in in the elections his predecessor petro poroshenko also carried ninety percent of the of the precincts and and the same happened with zelensky so the country unified after twenty fourteen to a degree it was impossible to to imagine before and zelensky felt that zelensky knew that and that's that's that's where where the talent of politician really matters and that that's that's something that you can see beyond beyond just data and and and you can feel that apparently yeltsin had that ability why did the peace talks fail there was a lot of peace talks well the the main reason is that the conditions that russia was trying to impose on ukraine were basically unacceptable for ukraine because one of the conditions apart from this strange thing called demilitification was of course de facto loss of the territory and for the future really staying outside either of nato or any any any western support mhmm which was very clear you can buy a couple of weeks you can buy a couple of months but in the conditions like that russia will come back tomorrow and will take over everything and once once ukrainians realize that they can win on the battlefield once the russians were defeated and withdraw from kyiv the the opportunity emerged to get out of the of the negotiations which was very clear were leading if not today then tomorrow to the complete destruction of ukraine and then of course once the territory started to be liberated things like bucha and and massacres of the civilian population came to the fore which made also quite difficult if not impossible to conduct negotiations from this moral and emotional point of view what about the claims that you know boris johnson the west compromised the ability of these peace talks to be successful basically you kind of manipulated the talks i asked people who accompanied bruce johnson to kyiv that question the answer was no and i believe this answer and i'll tell you why because it is very difficult for me to imagine president zelensky to take orders from anybody in the world either whether it's joel johnson or or joe biden or anybody else and basically doing things that zelenskyy believes are not in his interest or in the interest of his country i just can't imagine that anybody in the world telling zelensky what to do and zelensky actually following it against his own his own wishes and desires at least if if that is possible what is in the public sphere doesn't allow us to to suggest that it is that said zelensky is a smart man and he knows that the war can only continue with the west's support that is a different supposition to know that it can continue with the west support but if we are talking about withdrawing from the negotiations that's that's not about the continuation of the war for that you don't need western support well what i mean is if he started to sense that the west will support no matter what then maybe the space of decisions you're making is different we can interpret that that way but boris johnson represented at that point britain not the united states and really what what what the war showed and it was clear already at that time that what was needed was massive support from from the west as a whole and the promise of that support came only after the west realized that ukraine can win and came only in late april with the rammstein so at least a few weeks later so i don't know how much bruce johnson could promise he probably could promise to try to help and and try to convince and try to work on that if if zelensky acted on that promise he certainly was taking a risk but the key issue again i'm going back where i started it's principle and acceptance for ukraine the conditions that were offered and ukraine was the the moment they saw the possibility that they could fight back with johnson support without johnson support they they took the chance so what are the ways this work can end do you think what are the different possible trajectories whether it's peace talks what does winning look like for either side what is the role of us what what trajectories do you see that are possible it's it's a question on the one level very easy to answer on the other very difficult the level on which it is very easy it's it's a broad historical perspective if you really believe and i believe in that that this is the war of the soviet succession that this is the war of the disintegration of empire we know how the story ends and they end with disintegration of empire they end with the rise of the new states and the parents of the new colored spots on the map that's the story that started with the american revolution so that's that's long term perspective the difficult part is of course what will happen tomorrow the difficult part is what what day will be in in in two days and or even in two years and in very broad terms the the war can end in one of three scenarios the victory of one side the victory of another side and a sort of a stalemate and compromise especially when it comes when it comes to the territories this war is already approaching the end of the second year i follow the the news and look analysis i don't remember one single piece suggesting that the next year will will bring peace or will bring peace for sure and we we are in a in a situation where the both sides still believe that they can achieve something or improve their position on the battlefield certainly that was the expectations of ukrainian side back in the in the in the summer and and the fall of twenty twenty three and from what i understand now this is certainly the expectations of the russian side today this is this is the largest war in europe since world war two the largest war in the world since korean war and we know that that the the korean war ended in this division division of korea but the negotiations were going on for more than two years while those negotiations were going on both sides were trying to improve their position there and until there was a political change death of stalin arrival of eisenhower in the united states and the realization that the the the chances of succeeding on the battlefield huge the peace talks didn't come so at this point all three scenarios are possible i don't i don't really discount any of them it's early early to to say what will happen so without any political change let's try to imagine what are the possibilities that the war ends this year is it possible that it can end with compromise basically at the place it started meaning back to the borders of twenty twenty two yeah back to the borders of twenty two with some security guarantees that aren't really guarantees but are hopeful guarantees no it's it's it it is not just virtual impossibility it is impossible without political change in moscow the reason is that back in the fall of twenty twenty two vladimir putin included five of ukrainian region's obelisks even those that he didn't control or didn't control fully into the russian constitution which basically in simple language is that the hands are tied up not only for putin himself but also for his possible successors so that means that no return to the borders of twenty twenty two without without change political change in moscow are possible a few days after after that that that that decision in moscow zelensky issued a decree saying that no negotiations with russia what what that really meant in plain language is that basically we are not prepared to negotiate a stable agreement with five of our obelisks not just the next but also included into the russian constitution so that's where we are so the the the the that that scenario is is again everything is possible of course but it's highly highly unlikely so the russian constitution is a is a thing that's very that makes us all very difficult yes and not only as a negotiation tactic for putin whoever would would negotiate on the russian side but also as as a legal issue so like the the practical aspect of it even is difficult you really have to change the constitution before the peace agreement takes hold or immediately after that and with the minsk agreements that was one of things that russia wanted from ukraine change of the constitution and it turned out to be really impossible so that that's one of the one of the backstories of the of the minsk and and collapse of the minsk agreements is there something like minsk agreements that are possible now to maybe this is a legal question but to override the constitution to sort of shake everything up so see the constitutional amendment as a as just a negotiation tactic to to come at the table to something like minsk agreement given how how fast those those amendments to the constitution were adopted that suggests that really executive power in in russia has enormous power over the the legislative branch mhmm so it's it's again difficult to imagine but technically this is possible again if if the but but possible if there is a political change in moscow i don't understand why assuming political change in moscow is not possible this year so i'm trying to see if there's a way to end this war this year right there is a possibility of armistice right but armistice more along the like any armistice along the lines of the current front lines but withdrawal of the russian troops to the borders of twenty twenty two at this point whether it's reasonable or unreasonable can be achieved all only as the result of the defeat of the russian army like it happened near kyiv is it possible possible is it likely especially given what is happening with the western support military support for for for ukraine probably not but if putin the executive branch has a lot of power why can't the united states president the russian president the ukrainian president come to the table and draw up something like the minsk agreements where and then rapid constitutional change is made and you go back to the borders in twenty twenty two before twenty twenty two like through agreements through compromise impossible for you certainly not this year i look at this year as the time when at least one side russian side will try to get as much as it can through the through military means but that's been happening last year too there's been a counter offensive there's been attempts there's been it doesn't mean that every that new year somehow is supposed to bring new tactics that the the last year was pretty much a a lot of fighting a lot of suffering very little movement of the of the frontline the biggest change of the last year was ukraine victory on the on the black sea where they pushed the the russian navy into the western part of the pond and restored the the grain corridor and export from odessa apparently up to seventy five percent of what it used to be before the war so that's that's the the only major change but again the the the price is enormous in terms of wealth in terms of especially in terms of lives so thinking about what twenty twenty four brings zelensky just fired ukraine's head of the army a man you've mentioned general valery zaluzhny what do you make of this development this is a very very dangerous moment in in the war the reason for that is that zaluzhny is someone who is very popular with the army and with people in general so if you look at that through american pries that would be something analogous to president truman firing general mccarthy mhmm given that stakes for us at that time were very high but probably not as high as they are for ukraine for ukraine today in both cases what is at stake is certainly the idea that the political leadership and military leadership have to be on the same page and the question is whether on the part of zelensky this is just the change of the leadership or this is also the change of his approach to the war and that can can mean many things one can mean him taking more active part in planning operations it can mean also possible change of the tactic in the war given that counter offensive didn't didn't work out we don't know yet i don't know whether president zelensky at this point knows exactly what what what will come next but this is this is the time when the the change of the leadership in the country and in the army that is at war it's it's it's one of the most most trying most dangerous moments so the thing that president zelensky expressed is that this is this is going to be a change of tactics making the the approach more technologically advanced these kind of things but as you said i believe he is less popular than the chief of the army zaluzhny eighty percent to sixty percent depending on the polls do you think it's possible that zelensky's days are numbered as the president that that somebody like zaluzhny comes to power what we know is that in this war ukrainian people really united around their president and the armed forces were always even before the start of the war more popular than was the presidential office so the change if if happened in that realm was not was not so dramatic and from what i can see from from social media in ukraine there is a lot of unhappiness a lot of questions but there is also realization and very strong realization that country has to stay united and certainly the behavior of zelushni himself is there basically not suggesting any sort of a pre gauging type of of scenario that gives me some hope actually a lot of hope and in terms of whether zelensky's days are numbered or not i don't think they're numbered but if ukraine stays a democracy and i believe it will stay the what comes to my mind is the story of churchill the story of de gaulle in poland the story of pilsudski so once the war is over really the the electorate in the in the democratic elections they want to change the political leadership they want to move forward but koszewski came back to power and de gaulle came back to power and churchill came back to power so now i i whatever happens in the in the short run or medium term run i i think that zelensky days in politics are not numbered so what to you is interesting for example if i get a chance to interview what what what to you is interesting about the the person that that would be good to ask about to explore about the state of his mind his thinking his view of the world as it stands today next month we're supposed to take place ukrainian elections they're not taking place because the majority of ukrainians don't think this is the right thing to do to change the president to have the elections to have a political struggle in the middle of the war so zelensky refused to call those elections despite the fact that he he is and continues to be the most popular politician in ukraine so it would be in his to his benefit but that's that's clearly not what what the ukrainians want but the question of continuing as the president beyond five years also one way or another would raise questions about the legitimacy and certainly certainly russia will be playing this card like there is no tomorrow and what i would be interested in asking zelensky about whether whether he sees that his second term which comes on those conditions would suggest different different attitude toward their position maybe some form of the of the coalition government like it was the case in britain with churchill under different circumstances of course or this is basically in his opinion something that would be destructive and something that would would really be an impediment for for the issue for the question of unity and war effort and i would ask this question not not to basically suggest that that's that's the way to go but i i would be very much interested to to hear what is his thinking about that is do you think there's a degree during wartime that the power that comes with being a war president can corrupt a person sort of push you away from the democratic mindset towards an authoritarian one i think that there is a possibility of that right you in the conditions of any any emergency a war and in the case of the soviet union there was a chernobyl disaster and so on and so forth you make decisions much faster you you you create this vertical and then it's it's very easy to get to get really used to that way dealing with the issues in in the conditions of emergency right and then if they continue emergency or or there's no emergency they are continuing the emergency mode i i think again that that would be a very very natural thing for any human being to to do to make it easier should i do that easier and in more effective way or should i do the right way that's that's a challenge it's it's it's it's it's sometimes it's difficult to answer this question let me stay in power for just a little longer to do it the efficient way yep and then time flies away and all of a sudden you're it's it's you you go on for the third term and the fourth term and suddenly it's easy to realize that actually you can't rule in any other way you just whatever skills you had of people around that can help is that already gone exactly the people that surround you are not providing the kind of critical feedback necessary for a democratic system one of the things that tucker said after his interview with putin he was just in his hotel just chatting on on video and he said that he felt like putin was not very good at explaining himself like a coherent whole narrative of why the invasion happened or it's just this big picture and he said that's not because he doesn't have one but it's been a long time since he's had somebody around him where he has to explain himself to so he's out of practice which is very interesting it's a very interesting point and that's what war and being in power for a prolonged period of time can do so on that topic if you had a chance to talk to putin what kind of questions would you ask him what what would you like to find out about the man as he stands today as a historian i have a lot of questions and i have questions about when when the decision was made to attack ukraine and what went into this decision because we are we are thinking about that we are trying so as a historian i i have this this this big question i have question about the crimea when those decisions were made so that sort of questions that that interest me but the rest either i think that i understand what is going on with him or i don't expect the answer that can help for for example a good question whether you regret or not the start of the war in twenty twenty two given given the enormous enormous casualties on both sides but you can't expect from a politician an honest answer to this question right so there there are questions to which i know he can't answer honestly and then there are other questions to which i think he already provided all answers that he could so what what for me is is is of interest are basically questions for historian about about the the timing and and the and the and the logic of particular decisions well i do wonder how different what he says publicly is from what he thinks privately so a question about when the decision to invade ukraine happens is a very good question to give insight to the difference between how he thinks about the world privately versus what he says publicly yeah and same about other you know about empire because if you ask putin he will say he has no interest in empire and he finds the notion silly but at the same time perhaps privately there's a sense in which he does seek the the reunification of the russian empire not in the form of the russian empire not in the form of the soviet union but certainly in some form of the russian control that's that's that's for me at least it's it's quite clear otherwise there would be no busts to the bust to the to the russian emperors and catherine and and and peter and others you wrote in your book titled the frontline essays on ukraine's past and present about the russian question i guess articulated by solzhenitsyn first in nineteen ninety four solzhenitsyn of course is the author of gulag archipelago he's half ukrainian what is the russian question solzhenitsyn clearly identifies himself as russian and his opposition to the communist regime was was a position of a russian nationalist so his argument was that communism was bad for russia and for him russian question is about the russians ethnic russians but also he was thinking about russians in in putin's terms or putin thinks in in solzhenitsyn's terms about ukrainians and belarusians constituting part of that so the russian question is the biggest tragedy of the twentieth century the division of the russians the the loss of the statehood and division of the russians between different different states this is this is for solzhenitsyn russian question and his original idea and plan was presented in the essay that he published in nineteen ninety which was called how we should restructure russia and restructure russia meant getting rid of the baltics central asia and caucasus and have russians ukrainians and belarusians including those who live in northern kazakhstan to create one nation state so he was a russian nationalist but he was thinking about russian nation state as the state of russians ukrainians and belarusians and once the soviet union collapsed and his his idea was not implemented in the nineteen nineties he formulated plan b taken over by russia of donbas crimea and southern ukraine the areas that now are included in the russian constitution so in terms in historical terms and intellectual terms what is happening today in in the war between russia and ukraine is the the vision on one level or another level that was formulated by the nobel laureate alexander solzhenitsyn half russian half ukraine if if there is such a thing what what would you say is the ukrainian question as we stand today the ukrainian question is very simple it's now it's not anymore acquisition of the nation state but actually a sovereign state but it's it's it's maintenance so it's ukrainian question is like dozens of other questions in the twentieth and twenty first century the rise the rise of the new state and that's that's that's what is the ukrainian question whether whether ukraine will continue to its existence as a nation as an independent state because that existence has been questioned by stating that russians and ukrainians are one and the same people which de facto saying your guy is russian and also trying to to destroy the state is it possible that if the war in ukraine continues for many more years that the next leader that follows zelensky would take ukraine away from a sort of democratic western style nation towards a more authoritarian one maybe even with a far right influence this kind of direction because of the war the influence of war everything is possible and the longer the war continues the more likely scenario like that becomes but realization of that scenario would go against the grain of largest part of ukrainian history where ukraine really emerged as a pluralistic state in which the elements of democracy were built in the last thirty years would go against the grain of the ukrainian society where as one author formulated in the nineteen nineties he wrote a book ukrainian nationalism and minority faith where the nationalism was a minority faith and radical nationalism continues to be or at least continued to be in twenty nineteen a minority faith during the last elections so possible but unlikely given the historical realities of the last thirty plus years i could talk to you for many more hours on chernobyl alone since you've written a book on chernobyl and nuclear disaster this there's just a million possible conversations here but let me just jump around history a little bit back to world war back before world war two my grandmother lived through holodomor and world war two nazi occupied ukraine holodomor what do you learn let's say about human nature and about governments and nations from the fact that holodomor happened and maybe you could say what it is and why it happened holodomor is a massive famine in ukraine between the years nineteen thirty two and nineteen thirty four and it happened as the result of forceful collectivization of the agriculture and a temp on the part of stalin also really roll ukraine into the soviet union with basically no no potential opposition from from ukraine now national communists so two things came together in december of nineteen thirty two when in the same decree stalin and molotov signed a decree on the requisition of the grain which lead eventually to the mass starvation and on the banning of ukrainian language publications and education out in other rep soviet republics outside of ukraine and introducing limitations on the the so called ukrainization policies so on the use of ukrainian language in ukraine itself and the the numbers are debated the the numbers that most of the scholars work today are four million but again there are larger numbers as well that that circulate and this is the the the famine of thirty two thirty three was not exclusive ukrainian phenomenon but most of ukraine in the soviet union died in ukraine and ukraine was the only place where the policy on collecting grain were coming together with the policy of the cleansing of the political leadership sending people from moscow to take over the leadership and attack on ukrainian culture so in terms of what i learn about human nature it's more me learning about the the ideologies of the twentieth century because it's not the only famine in the communist lands the famine in china which was in terms of the numbers much more devastating than that it's in a different category and for a good reason but you have holocaust what unites these things are are is the time this is twentieth century what unites them are the dominance in the societies that are doing that really ideologies that not just devalued human life but considered that actually the way forward is by destroying large group of populations defined ethnically religiously socially or otherwise which tells about the time but tells also about humanity because for for centuries before that human life was valued there were enemies but the idea was that human life can put and and you can at the end of the day they can be slaves they can be you can use them for productive force countries in the eighteenth century with southern ukraine they were looking for settlers for people to bring and and and live on land you move into the twentieth century and there is mass destruction of the population in the name of ideologies which basically are by definition destroy human lives and that's what's really so shocking and striking because that's that break was not just with issues of morale not just with issues of humanity with with any common sense what is what is happening and i i'm absolutely convinced that we didn't learn the lesson i'm absolutely convinced that we didn't learn the lesson with turning our page on fascism and communism we somehow decided that we are free of that that at least in those terms history came to an end that what is ahead is is the future and nothing of that sort would would happen would take place to a degree that people would get in trouble for comparing any statements or or events that are happening today with either either the communism or fascism and and so i i i feel responsibility of myself and as a historian in particular for not not doing a better job about about telling people that well we we are we are who we are and we we we have as humans our dark side and we have to be we have to be very careful so there is a human capacity to be captured by an idea an ideology that claims to bring up a better world as the nazis did as soviet union did and on the path of doing that devaluing human life that we will bring a better world and and if millions of people have to be tortured on the way to that alright but at least we have a better world and human beings are able to if not accept that look the other way yes yes and in the name of a particular nation or race like like with the third reich or in in the name of the humanity of the future so not just devalue human life destroy human life is there something fundamental about communism and centralized planning that's part of the problem here maybe this also connects the story of chernobyl where the chernobyl disaster is not just a story of failure of a nuclear power plant but it's an entire institution of a scientific and nuclear institution but the entirety of the government there is and there is a number of factors of political and social character that that produced chernobyl and one of them is generally the atmosphere of secrecy in the soviet union in the conditions of the cold war chernobyl reactor was a dual purpose reactor it could boil water today and produce enriched uranium tomorrow right so it was top secret and if there were problems with that with that reactor those problems were kept secret even at people who operated that's that's what happened that's what happened in chernobyl another another big big part of the story which is specifically soviet that's the nature of the managerial culture and administrative culture in which people had no right to make their own decisions in their their place in their position a few years before that three mile island happened which was a big big nuclear disaster but in terms of consequences nothing nothing like chernobyl and there in the context of the american legal culture managerial culture people who were operators who were in managerial positions that was their responsibility to take decisions president carter came there but he was not calling shots on on none of those issues what you see with chernobyl and people who saw hbo series know that very well the moment the high official arrives everyone actually falls in line it's the official who calls the shot and to move population from the city of pripyat you needed the okay coming from moscow from the from the very top so that is soviet story and and there is a global story of cutting corners to to meet either deadlines like it was with that test that they were running at that time or to meet production quarters this is not just socialist thing you can replace production quotas with with profit and and and you you you get you you get the same story so some parts of in that story are generally reflective of of our of our today's world in general others are very specific very specific for soviet union for for soviet experience and then the biggest the biggest probably soviet part of that story is that on the one hand the government in moscow and kyiv they mobilize all resources to deal with that but they keep information about what is happening and the radiation clouds secret from the from the rest of the population something that completely would be impossible and was impossible possible in us in uk where other accidents happened and then guess what a few years later the soviet union collapses very much also thanks to the mobilization of people over the issue of chernobyl and nuclear energy in people writing about that that subject call it eco nationalism ecological nationalism which comes at least in part from this withholding information from people and in ukraine mobilization didn't start over the issues of that led to independence didn't start over the issue of language or didn't start over the issue of national autonomy it started under the slogans tell us the truth about chernobyl we want to know whether we live in contaminated areas or not and that was a very very strong factor that that crossed the the not just ethnic religious linguistic lines lines between members of the party and not members of the party of the top leadership and not in military and civilian because it turned out that the party car didn't protect you from being affected by by radiation so the all national mobilization happens the first mass manifestations are about chernobyl not about anything else that's fascinating i mean for people who might not know chernobyl is located in ukraine it would be it's a fascinating view that chernobyl might be one of the critical sort of threshold catalysts for the collapse of the soviet union that's very interesting just as a small aside i guess this is a good moment to give some love to the hbo series it made me even though it's british accents and so on it made me realize that some of these stories in eastern europe could be told very effectively through film through series it was quite a it's i mean it was it's so incredibly well done and maybe i can ask you historically speaking were you impressed i was i was and i think that the miniseries are very truthful on on a number of levels and very untruthful on some others and they got they got excellent in in very well the the macro and micro levels mhmm so the macro level is the issue of the big truth and and the the the story there is very much built around the theme that i just discussed now it's about the the the cost of lies right and the soviet union lying to the people and that's what the film explores so that that that's i call it a big truth about chernobyl and they got a lot of minor things really really very well like the curtains on the windows like how the houses looked from inside and outside i didn't see any post soviet film or any western film that would be so good at capturing those everyday mhmm details but then there is a huge gray area in between big truth and small truth is of the of the recreating the environment and that's how you get from one to another and then you see the kgb officers come in and taking someone out of the meeting and arresting which was not necessary you see the soviet boss threatening someone to throw the person from the helicopter so you get this hollywood sort of things despite the fact that it's hbo hbo series and they are the best really in terms as as a film in the fourth episode where they can completely decided just to hell with the reality and let's let's make a film so they bring legasov to the one of the key characters to the this court meetings that they bring the key soviet party boss shcherbina he wasn't there they create a drama there so but so they they they got they got the main thing the big truth right and that's that's why i like this this this production sometimes you have to to show what something felt like you have to go bigger than it actually was i mean if you i don't know if you experience heartbreak and you wanna and you see a film about it you want there to be explosions you want to see this this in images yeah visible right so and but the the the question again i i just mentioned kgb marching in and and some party leader give giving a speech they were not given that speech but the sense was there and it was in the air and i as people of my generation who were there knew that and recognized that but for for new generation whether they are in ukraine in russia in us in britain in in in zimbabwe anywhere yeah you have to you have to do this this little little untruths and and introduce them and i had a very interesting on on air conversation with the author of the script mason and i asked him the question of yeah the the film declared really the importance of the truth but how do you square that with yeah with with the need in the film to to really put it mildly to go beyond beyond the measures of truth what what our understanding of that term is well i suppose it is a bit terrifying that some of the most dramatic moments in history are probably quite mundane the decisions to begin wars invasions they're probably something like a a zoom meeting on a on on a random tuesday in today's workplace so it's not it's not like there's dramatic music playing this is just human decisions and they command armies and they command destruction i i personally because of that believe in the power of individuals to to to be able to stop wars not just star wars individual leaders so let me just ask about nuclear safety because there's an interesting point you make you wrote in the book in in atoms and ashes a global history of nuclear disaster so technically nuclear energy is extremely safe there's a number of people died per energy generated it's much safer than coal and oil for example as far as i understand but the case you also make is you write quote many of the political economic social and cultural factors that led to the accidents of the past are still with us today making the nuclear industry vulnerable to repeating old mistakes in new and unexpected ways and any new accidents are certain to create new antinuclear mobilization and then you continue with this makes the nuclear industry not only risky to operate but also impossible to count on as a long term solution to an overwhelming problem so can you explain that perspective it's it's an interesting it's an interesting one so speaking to the psychology when an accident does happen it has a dramatic effect and also speaking to the fact that accidents can happen not because of the safety of the nuclear power plant but of the underlying structure of government that oversees it yes i wrote book on chernobyl and then tried to understand chernobyl better but placing it in the context of other disasters as a historian and was looking at the political factors and social factors and cultural factors not not the the physics or or engineering part of the story and the factors that are still with us are the like it was the case in chernobyl the authoritarian regimes right and and and high centralization of the decision making and desire to cut corners and also the issues associated with secrecy so that's that's that that that is with us if you look at the where the future of the nuclear industry is now at this point it's the regimes and parts in the middle east that's a big new frontier the countries that are not particularly known for the history of democratic existence where we also have the situation that we had at three mile island that we had at at at chernobyl this is the first generation engineers nuclear engineers right so people who are where the country doesn't have a lot of experience in generations after generations working in that particular industry where it's all new that's that's certainly that that that is certainly additional additional risk and what we got now with this current war is something that not that people completely didn't expect but didn't happen in the past you see the war coming to the nuclear sites chernobyl was taken over by the russian army or national guard rather on the first day of the invasion then there was zaporizhzhia the largest nuclear power plant in europe where the battle was waged on the territory of the nuclear power plant the the missiles being fired buildings catching fire and the the situation of the that brought the fukushima disaster was there at zaporizhzhia more than once and fukushima came because the rectors were shut down as they are at zaporizhzhia but they still needed electricity to bring water and to cool them down mhmm and in fukushima case it was the tsunami that cut off the supply of electricity in the case of zaporizhzhia there was the warfare that was happening in the area around zaporizhzhia that did did the same effect so we have four hundred forty reactors in the world today plus minus none of them was designed to withstand the direct missile attack or to function in the conditions of the warfare if operators they're human then they make mistakes like they did it through mile island or chernobyl but think also if the war is happening around them if they're not sure what is happening with their with their families if they don't know whether they will be next missile whether they will hit the room where where the the control room or not that that multiplies also so we we are in a situation where we are not done yet with the nuclear accidents you each time it's not like we don't pay attention or we don't learn smart people work on that and after every accident try to figure the way how not to to to to step in in in into the same into the same trap but next accident would actually expose a new new vulnerability you deal with chernobyl and then tsunami comes you deal with tsunami and then war comes and we we really in that sense we have sometimes wild imagination but sometimes it's difficult to imagine what can happen next so we are not done there will be there will be nuclear accidents unfortunately in the future and that makes nuclear energy so problematic when you count on it to fight climate change i'll explain why you gave the figures how many people die from burning coal from how many people die from from radiation and it's it's it's it's a good argument some people would question them because it's also the issue of not just dying but impact impact of radiation on on cancer on on our health which is not completely understood yet so it's still there there is a lot of question marks but let's assume what you are saying that's the figures that's how it is but we as people we for whatever reason are not afraid of coal but we are very much afraid of radiation it's invisible it's it's covid it's everywhere mhmm and you can't you can't see it mhmm and then and then you start having issues and and then you have sudden problems and during the covid the the governments closed the borders maybe maybe a good idea maybe not so good ideas i i i isolation so that that was the way government started to to fight for access to pfizer to to moderna to to to sputnik to to whatever it is to to vaccine so now back to the to the radiation what is happening once once chernobyl happens that's the the highest point in the development of nuclear industry so far in terms of how many how many new reactors were commissioned or the the licenses were issued the next rack reactor after three mile island in the us go ahead was given it seems to me ten years ago or something like that the fukushima happens the reaction is in china to that as well they're very much concerned so there is a saying in the field chernobyl anywhere is chernobyl everywhere after fukushima germany decides to go nuclear free and and gets there at the expense of burning burning coal so that's that's how we react and each major accident that means global freeze on the on the on the nuclear reactor production for at least another ten years so that's what i mean that nuclear industry is politic not just in in terms of of of technology not just in terms of radiation impact on health but also politically a very very unreliable option and to you you suspect that that's an irreparable aspect of human nature and the human mind that there are certain things that just create a kind of panic invisible threats of this kind whether it's a virus or or radiation there's something about the mind if i get a stomachache in the united states after fukushima i kinda think it's probably radiation this kind of irrational type of thinking and that's not impossible to repair i think we can we can be we can be trained right we can be trained pretty smart aren't we but but but but generally we are afraid of things that we see but even more we're afraid of things that we don't see and radiation is one of those let's zoom out on the world we talked about the war in ukraine how does the war in ukraine change the world order let me just look at everything that's going on zoom out a bit china the israel gaza war the middle east india what is interesting to you important to think about in the coming years and decades as a historian and i'm trained that way i have a feeling of deja vu i see the the the cold war is coming back in many in many of its of its features and the war started and and we discussed that in twenty fourteen at least in my interpretation with russia trying to really reestablish its control over the post soviet space and ukraine is was crucial for that for that project and the more globally russian vision since nineteen nineties was that they didn't like the american monopolar world they knew and realized that they couldn't go back to the bipolar world of the of the cold war era so the the vision was multipolar world in which again it wasn't just academic exercise it was a political exercise in which russia would be one of the centers one of the poles on par with china on par with european union on par with the united states that's that's very broadly speaking the context in which in which the war starts in twenty in twenty fourteen where we are now well we are now in russia certainly trying to regain its military strength but no one actually believes that russia is the sort of a superpower it was imagined before twenty twenty two we see certainly russia finding the way to deal with the sanctions but we don't see certainly russia as a as a economic economic power with any sort of a future so it is not an implosion of the of the russian military economic and political power but it's significantly actually it is diminished so today very difficult to imagine the russia emerging as another pole of the of the multipolar world not impossible but it's the war certainly made that that very problematic and and much more difficult on the other hand what the war did it basically awakened the west the old west united states and western europe transatlantic alliance and on the top of that there are east european countries that are even much stronger proponents of of assistance for ukraine than is germany or or or the united states of america so it is it is the the replay of the cold war story the return of the west that one of the chapters in my book the russo ukrainian war is is called that way we also can see the elements of the rebuilding of the beijing moscow alliance of the nineteen fifties which was a very important part of the cold war it was extremely important part of the korean war that in many ways launched launched also the the cold war globally so i see a lot of parallels of going back to the time of the cold war and the bipolar world that emerges it's not anymore the world focused on washington and moscow it's more like world focused on on washington and beijing and then there are countries in between there are countries in between that that join join one block or another block that is emerging that is not fully fully formed this is this is in my opinion makes the task of of us historians to really go back to the cold war and look and look for for a through a new perspective on on the history of that conflict because there is a lot of things that we can we can learn so so in in some ways history does repeat itself here so now it's a cold war with china and and the united states what's a hopeful trajectory for the twenty first century for the rest of it the hopeful trajectory is really trying to be as wise and as lucky as as our predecessors during the cold war because the the the dominant discourse so far about the cold war was what a horrible thing that cold war was what did we do wrong how did we end up in the cold war and i think especially today this is a wrong question to ask the right question to ask is how did it happen what did we do so right that for now more than seventy years we don't have a world war how come that after world war one world war two came within twenty years how come that what what helped us to keep the world on the brink but still away from the global war for such a long period of time how to keep the cold war cold that's that's the biggest lesson that the history of the cold war can give us and i don't think we we ask the question quite often enough ask the question that way and if you don't ask right questions we don't get right answers yeah you've written a book a great book on the cuban missile crisis and we came very close not to just another world war but to you know a nuclear war and the destruction of human civilization as we know it so i i guess it's a good question to ask what do we do so right and maybe one of the answers could be that we just got lucky and and the question is how do we how do we keep getting lucky luck luck is clearly clearly one of the factors in in the in cuban missile crisis because what happened then there is one of the lessons is that eventually the the commanders at the top they believe that they have all the cards they negotiate with each other they try to to see who who blinks first in in the game of nuclear brinkmanship the trick is that they don't control fully people on the ground the most dangerous moment or one of the most dangerous moment of the cuban missile crisis was the soviet missile shooting down the american airplane killing the pilot an act of war right so technically we're already in in war and the the order to shoot the missile was given with moscow having no clue what was going on the ground moscow never gave gave approval for that and again i described that in book many times about kennedy bringing back his wisdom from world war two years there there always will be sob who didn't get the order or or or missed things and and that that was happening on the american side as well so people who believe that they're in control really are not in control and that can escalate whether they it's very often against against their their issues so that is one lesson but going back to what why we are still here and why why the world didn't didn't end up in nineteen sixty two is that the leadership and and that's that's i i come to the issue that you strongly believe in that people personalities matter leaders matter they were they were very different right age education political careers understanding what politics are and so on and so forth you mean khrushchev khrushchev and kennedy yes but they had one thing in common that in one way they belong to the same generation that was generation of the bikini atoll that was the generation of the hydrogen bomb the bomb that unlike the atomic bomb they knew could destroy the world and they were scared they were scared of the nuclear of the nuclear weapons and they tried to do whatever they could pushing against the advisers or or or trying to deal with their with their anxieties the the first is true for kennedy the the the later maybe for khrushchev to make sure that this that the war between the united states and and the soviet union doesn't start because they knew that that war would be would be a nuclear war so we have we have a very very paradoxical sort of situation the crisis occurred because of the nuclear weapons because cushor put them on cuba but the crisis was resolved and we didn't end in the third world war because of the nuclear weapons because people leaders were afraid of them and that's that's where i want to put emphasis it's not that the nuclear weapons created crisis or solved the crisis it's basically our perception of them and we are now in the age after the cold war era is the new generation of voters is the new generation of politicians who don't belong to the generation of at all we maybe know what is but we think that this is something different different thing yeah that this is something else and it's very it's very important it's it's so fascinating how that fades into memory that the power and and the respect and fear of the power of nuclear weapons just fades into memory and then we may very well make the same mistakes again yes we can another leader said that i believe but about a a totally different topic well like you said i'm i'm also glad that we're here more as a civilization that we still seem to be going on there's several billion of us and i'm also glad that the two of us are here i've read a lot of your books i've been recommending it please keep writing thank you for talking today this is an honor thank you very much luke it was it was a pleasure thanks for listening to this conversation with serhiy plohi to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from ernest hemingway never think that war no matter how necessary nor how justified is not a crime thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
