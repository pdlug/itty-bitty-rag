the following is a conversation with benjamin netanyahu prime minister of israel currently serving his sixth term in office he's one of the most influential powerful and controversial men in the world leading a right wing coalition government at the center of one of the most intense and long lasting conflicts and crises in human history as we spoke and as i speak now large scale protests are breaking out all over israel over this government's proposed judicial reform that seeks to weaken the supreme court in a bold accumulation of power given the current intense political battles in israel our previous intention to speak for three hours was adjusted to one hour for the time being but we agreed to speak again for much longer in the future i will also interview people who disagree with the words spoken in this conversation i will speak with other world leaders with religious leaders with historians and activists and with people who have lived and have suffered through the pain of war destruction and loss that stoke the fires of anger and hate in their heart for this i will travel anywhere no matter how dangerous if there's any chance it may help add to understanding and love in the world i believe in the power of conversation to do just this to remind us of our common humanity i know i'm underqualified and under skilled for these conversations so i will often fall short and i will certainly get attacked derided and slandered but i will always turn the other cheek and use these attacks to learn to improve and no matter what never give in to cynicism this life this world of ours is too beautiful not to keep trying trying to do some good in whatever way each of us know how i love you all and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in

today this is the lex fridman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's benjamin netanyahu you're loved by many people here in israel and in the world but you're also hated by many in fact i think you may be one of the the most hated men in the world so if there's a young man or a young woman listening to this right now who have such hate in their heart what can you say to them to one day turn that hate into love i disagree with the premise of your question i think i have i've enjoyed a very broad support around the world there are certain corners in which we have we have this animosity that you described and it sort of permeates in some of the the newspapers and the news organs and so on in in the united states but it certainly doesn't reflect the the broad support that i have i just gave a an interview on an iranian channel sixteen million viewers i gave another one i just did a a a little video a few years ago twenty five million viewers from iran certainly no hate there i have to tell not from the regime okay and when i go around the world and i've been around the world people wanna hear what we have to say what i have to say as a leader of israel whom they respect increasingly as a rising power in the world so i i disagree with that and the most important thing that goes against what you said is the respect that we receive from the arab world and the fact that we've made four historic peace agreements with arab countries they made it with me they didn't make it with anyone else and i respect them and they respect me and probably more to come so i think the premise is wrong that's all well there's a lot of love yes the a lot of leaders are collaborating are respect i said not not though okay alright well it's it's a spectrum yeah but there is people who don't have good things to say about israel who do have hate in their heart for israel yeah and what can you say to those people well i think they don't know very much i think they're guided by a lot of ignorance they don't know about israel they don't know that israel is a stellar democracy that it happens to be one of the most advanced societies on the planet that what israel develops helps humanity in every field in medicine in agriculture in in the environment in telecoms and talk about ai in a minute but changing the world for the better and spreading this among six continents we've sent rescue teams more than any other country in the world and we're one tenth of one percent of the world's population but when there's an earth earthquake or a devastation in haiti or in the philippines israel is there when there's an earthquake devastating earthquake in turkey turkey israel was there when there's something in nepal israel is there and it's a second country it's the second country after in one case india or after another case the united states israel is there tiny israel is a benefactor to all of humanity so you're a student of history if i can just linger on that philosophical notion of hate that part of human nature if you look at world war two what do you learn from human nature from the rise of the third reich and the rise of somebody like hitler and the hate that permeates that well what i've learned is that you have to nip bad things in the bud you have to there's a latin term that says stop bad things when they're small and the deliberate hatred the the incitement of hatred against one community it's demonization delegitimization that goes with it is a is a very dangerous thing and that happened in the case of the jews what started with the jews soon spread to all of humanity so what we've learned is that's what we should we should never and i never sit aside and say oh they're just threatening to destroy us they won't do it if somebody threatens to eliminate you as iran is doing today and as hitler did then and people discounted it well if somebody threatens to annihilate well take them seriously and act to prevent it early on don't let them have the means to do so because that may be too late so in those threats underlying that hatred how much of it is anti zionism and how much of it is anti semitism i don't distinguish between the two you can't say well i'm i'm okay with jews but i just don't think there should be a jewish state it's like saying i'm not anti american i just don't think there should be an america that's basically what what people are saying vis a vis anti antisemitism and anti zionism when you say anti zionism you're saying the jewish people don't have a right to have a state of their own and that that is a denial of of a basic a basic principle that i think completely masks what is involved here today antisemitism is anti zionism those who oppose the jewish people oppose the jewish state if we jump from human history to the current particular moment there's protests in israel now about the proposed judicial reform that gives power to your government to override the supreme court so the critics say that this gives too much power to you virtually making you a dictator yeah well that's ridiculous the mere fact that you have so many demonstrations and protests some some dictatorship there's a lot a lot of democracy here more more rambunctious and more robust than just anywhere on the planet can you still man the case that this gives this may give too much power to the the coalition government to the prime minister not just to you but to those who follow no i i think that's complete hogwash because i i think there's there's a very few people are demonstrating against this quite a few quite many don't have an idea what is being discussed they're be basically being sloganized you can sloganize you know something about not mass media right now but the social network you can basically feed deliberately with big data and big money you can just feed slogans and get into people's minds i'm sure you don't think i exaggerate because you can tell me more about that and you can create mass mobilization based on these absurd slogans so here here's where we i come from and what we're doing what we're trying to do and what we've changed in what we're trying to do i'm a nineteenth century democrat in my small d yes mhmm in my views that is i view i ask the question what is democracy okay so democracy is is the will of the majority and the protection of the rights of they call it the rights of the minority but i say the rights of of the individual okay so how do you balance the two okay how do you get those how do you avoid mobocracy okay and how do you avoid dictatorship the opposite side the way you avoid it is something that was built essentially by british philosophers and french philosophers but was encapsulated by the founding fathers of the united states you create a balance between the three branches of government okay the legislative executive and the judiciary and this balance is what assures the balance between majority rights and individual rights and you have to balance all of them okay that balance was maintained in israel in its first fifty years and was gradually over overtaken and basically broken by the most activist judicial court on the planet that's what happened here and gradually over the last two three decades the the court aggregated for itself the powers of the parliament and the executive so we're trying to bring it back into line bringing it back into line into what is common in all parliamentary democracies and in the united states doesn't mean taking the pendulum from one side and bringing it to the other side we want checks and balances not unrivaled power just as we said we want an independent judiciary but not an all powerful judiciary that balance does not mean bringing it back into line doesn't mean that you can have the the parliament archnissa override any decision that the supreme court does so i pretty much early on said after the judicial reform was introduced get rid of the idea of a sweeping override clause that would have with sixty one votes that's majority of one you can just nullify any supreme court decision so let's move it back into the center so that's gone and most of the criticism on the judicial reform was based on a a on a a an unlimited override clause which i've said is simply not gonna happen people are discussing some something that already for six months does not exist the second point that we received criticism on was the the structure of how do you choose supreme court judges okay how do you how do you choose them and the critics of the reform are saying that the idea that elected officials should choose supreme court judges is the end of democracy if that's the case the united states is not a democracy neither is france neither are just i don't know just about every every democracy on on the planet so there is a view here that you can't have the sorted hands of elected officials involved in the choosing of judges and in the israeli system the judicial activism went so far that effectively the sitting judges have an effective veto on the on on choosing judges which means that this is a self selecting court that just per perpetrates itself and we wanna correct that again wanna correct it in a balanced way and that's basically what we're trying to do so i think there's a lot of misinformation about that we're trying to bring israeli democracy to where it was in its first fifty years and it was a stellar democracy it still is israel is a democracy will remain a democracy a vibrant democracy and believe me the fact that people are arguing and demonstrating in the streets and protesting is just is the best proof of that and that's how it'll remain we spoke about tech companies yeah offline there's a lot of tech companies nervous about this judicial reform can you speak to why large and small companies have a future in israel because israel is a free market economy i had something to do with that i introduced dozens and dozens of free market reforms that made israel move from seventeen thousand dollars per capita income to within a very short time to fifty four thousand dollars that's nominal gdp per capita according to the imf and we've overtaken in that japan france britain germany and how did that happen because we unleashed the the genius that we have and the initiative and the entrepreneurship that is latent in our population and to do that we had to create free markets so we created that so israel has one of the most vibrant free market economies in the world and the second thing we have is a permanent investment in conceptual products because we have a permanent investment in in the military in our security services creating basically knowledge workers who then become knowledge entrepreneurs and so we create this this structure and that's not gonna go away there's been a decline in investments in high-tech globally i think that's driven by many factors but the most important one is the interest rate which which i think will it'll fluctuate up and down but israel will remain a very attractive country because it produces so many so many knowledge workers in a knowledge based economy and it's changing so rapidly the world is changing you're looking for the places that have innovation the future belongs to this to those who innovate israel is the preeminent innovation nation it has few competitors and if we would say alright where do you have this close cross disciplinary fermentation of various skills and areas i would say it's in israel and i'll tell you why we used to be just telecoms because people went out of the you know military intelligence rnsa but that's been now broad based so you find it in medicine you find it in biology you find it in agri tech you find it everywhere everything is becoming technologized and in israel everybody is dealing in everything and that's a that's a potent reservoir of talent that the the world is not gonna pass up and in fact is coming to us we just had nvidia coming here and they decided to build a a supercomputer in israel wonder why we've had intel coming here and deciding now to invest twenty five billion dollars just now mhmm in a new plant in israel i wonder why i don't wonder why they know why because the talent is here and the freedom is here then it'll remain so so you had a conversation about ai with sam altman of openai and with elon musk yeah what was the content of that conversation what's your vision for sort of this very highest of tech which is artificial intelligence well first of all i have a high regard for the people i talk to okay and i i understand that they understand things i don't understand and i don't pretend to understand everything but i do understand one thing i understand that ai is developing at a geometric rate and mostly in in political life and in life in general people don't have an intuitive grasp of geometric growth you understand things basically in linear increments and the the idea that you're coming up a ski slope is very foreign to people so they don't understand it and they're naturally also sort of taken aback by it because what do you do okay so i i think the the there's several conclusions from my conversations with the with them and from my other observations that i've been talking about for many years i'm talking about the need to do this well the first thing is this there is no possibility of not entering ai with full force secondly there is a need for regulation third it's not clear there'll be global regulation fourth it's not clear where it ends up i i certainly cannot say that now you might say does it come to control us okay that's the question does it come to control us i don't know the answer to that i think that as as one observation that i had from these conversations is if it does come to controls that's probably the only chance of having universal regulation because i don't see anyone anyone deciding to you know to avoid the race and and cooperate unless you have that threat doesn't mean you can't regulate ai within countries even without that understanding but it does mean that there's a limit to regulation because every country will wanna make sure that it's not doesn't give up competitive advantage if there is no universal regulation i think that right now just as you know ten years ago i read i read a novel i don't read novels but i was forced to read one by a scientific adviser i read history i read about economics i read about technology i just don't read novels okay and this time followed churchill you know he said fact is better than fiction well this fiction would become fact and it was a book it was a novel about a chinese american's future cyber war and i read the book in one sitting called in a team of experts and i said alright let's let's turn israel into one of the world's five cyber powers and let's do it very quickly and we did actually we did we did exactly that i think ai is bigger than that and related to that because it'll affect well cyber affects everything but ai will affect it even more fundamentally but i think what about what about our databases that are already per very robust on on the medical records of ninety eight percent of our population why don't we stick a genetic database on that why don't we do other things that could bring magical what seem are are seemingly magical cures and drugs and medical instruments for that that's one possibility we have it in as i said in every single field the conclusion is this we have to move on ai we are moving on ai just as we moved on cyber and i think israel will be one of the leading one of the leading ai powers in the world the questions i don't have an answer to is where does it go how much does it eat chew up on on jobs there's an assumption that i'm not sure is true that all previous the two big previous revolutions in the human condition namely the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution definitely produced more jobs than they than they consumed okay that is not obvious to me at all i mean i could see new jobs creating and yes i have that you know that that comforting statement but it's not quite true because i think on balance they'll probably consume more jobs many more jobs than they'll create at least in the short term and we don't know about the long term no i don't know about the long term but i i used to have the comfort being a free market guy i always said you know we're gonna produce more jobs than you know by i don't know limiting certain government jobs we're actually putting out in the market we'll create more jobs which obviously happened you know we had one telecom company a government company when i said we're gonna you know we're going to create competition they said you're gonna run us out we're not gonna have more workers yeah they had thirteen thousand workers they went down to seven but we created another forty thousand in the other companies so that was a comforting thought i always knew that was true okay not only that i also knew that wealth would spread by opening up the markets completely opposite to the socialist and semi socialist creed that they had here they said you're you're gonna make the rich richer and the poor poor no and made everyone richer and actually the people who entered the job market because of the reforms we did actually became a lot richer on the on the the lowest the the lower ladders of the socioeconomic measure but here's the point i don't know i don't know that we will not have what elon musk calls the end of scarcity so you'll have the end of scarcity you'll have enormous productivity you know very few people are producing enormous added value you're gonna have to tax that to pass it to the others okay you're gonna have to do that that's a political question i'm not sure how we answer that what if you tax and somebody else doesn't tax you're gonna get everybody to go there that's an issue an international issue that we constantly have to deal with and the second question you have is suppose you solve that problem and you deliver money okay to those who are not involved in the ai economy what do they do the first question you ask somebody whom you just met after the polite you know the polite exchanges is what do you do mhmm right well people define themselves by their profession and it's gonna be difficult if you don't have a profession and you know people will spend more time self searching they'll more time in in the arts more time in leisure i understand that if i have to bet it will annihilate many more jobs than it will create and it'll force a structural change in our economics in our economic models and in our politics and i'm not sure where it's gonna go and that's something we have to respond to at the nation level and just as a human civilization both the threat of ai to just us as a human species and then the effect on the jobs and like you said cybersecurity and what do you think you think you think it's gonna we're gonna lose control no i first of all i do believe maybe naively that it will create more jobs than it takes write that down and we'll check it it's on record and you know we don't have we don't say we'll check it after our lifetime no we'll see it in a few years we'll see it in a few years i'm really concerned about cybersecurity and the nature of how that changes with the power of ai and in terms of existential threats i think there'll be so much threats that aren't existential along the way that that is the thing i'm mostly concerned about versus ai taking complete control and becoming sort of superseding the human species although that is something you should consider seriously because of the exponential growth of its capability it's exactly the exponential growth which we understand is before us but we don't really it's very hard to project forward to really understand that's right exactly right so you know i'm so i i deal with what i can where i can affect something i tend not to worry about things i don't control mhmm because at a certain point you know there's no point i mean you have to decide what you're spending your time on so i i think in practical terms i think we'll make we'll make israel a a formidable ai power we understand the limitation of scale computing power and other things but i think within the those limits i think we can make here this miracle that we we did and many other things you know we do more with less i don't care if it's water the production of water or the production of energy or the production of knowledge or the production of cyber capabilities defense and other we just do more with less and i think in ai we're gonna do a lot more with relatively small but highly gifted population very gifted so taking a small tangent as we talked about offline you have a a background in taekwondo oh yeah yeah yeah we mentioned elon musk i've trained with both just as a quick question who do you have who are you betting on in a fight well i refuse to answer that i will say this such a politician you are yeah of course here i'm a politician i'm openly telling you then i'm dodging the question okay but i'll say this you know i i actually i spent five years in our special forces in in the military and we barely spent a minute on martial arts i actually learned taekwondo later when i came to it wasn't even at mit at mit i think i did karate but when i came to the un i had a martial arts expert who taught me taekwondo which was kind of interesting now the question you really have to ask is why did we learn martial arts in this special elite unit and the answer is there's no point if you saw indiana jones you know there's no point you just you know pull the trigger that's simple now i don't expect anyone to pull the trigger on this combat and i'm i'm sure you'll you'll make sure that doesn't happen yeah i mean martial arts is is kind of it's bigger than just combat it's this kind of journey of humility and oh sure it has it's an art form it truly is an art mhmm but it's fascinating that these two figures in tech are facing each other and i won't ask a question of who you would face and how you would do but well i'm i'm facing opponents all the time all the time yeah that's part of life but you know part of life part of life is not yet i'm not sure about that are you announcing invites okay no no part of life is competition you know you know the only time competition ends is death but you know political life economic life cultural life is engaged continuously in creativity and competition and the the the problem i have with that is as i mentioned earlier just before we began the podcast is that at a certain point you want to put barriers to monopoly and if you're in a really able competitor you're gonna create a monopoly that's what peter thiel says is a natural course of things it's what i learned in basically in the boston consulting group if you're a very able competitor you'll create scale advantages that give you the ability to lock out your competition and as a prime minister i want to assure that there is competition in the market so you have to limit limit this competitive power to a certain point and that becomes increasingly hard in in the world where everything is intermissed where do you define market segments where do you define monopoly how do you do that that is very that that actually conceptually i find very challenging because of all the dozens of political of economic reforms that i've made the most difficult part is the conceptual part once you have you've ironed it out you say here's what i wanna do here's the right thing to do then you have a practical problem of overcoming union resistance political resistance press calumny you know opponents but from this or that corner that's a practical matter but if you have it conceptually defined you can move ahead to reform economies or reform education or reform transportation fine and the question of the growing power of large companies big tech companies to monopolize the markets because they're better at it they provide a service they provide a lower cost rapidly declining cost where do you stop where do you where do you stop monopoly power is a crucial question because it also becomes now a political question if you amass enormous amount of economic power which is information power you know that also monopolizes the political process which creates these are real questions that are not obvious i don't have an obvious answer because as i said as a nineteenth century democrat these are questions of the twenty first century which people should should begin to think do you have a solution to that the solution of monopolies growing arbitrarily yeah unstoppably in power in economic power and therefore in political power i mean some of that is regulation some of that is competition do you know where to put to draw the line stop breaking up at and t you know it's not that simple well i believe in the power of competition that there will always be somebody that challenges the big guys especially in the space of ai the more open source movements are taking hold the more the little guy can become the big guy so you're saying basically the regulatory the the regulatory instrument is the market in large part in most part mhmm that's the hope maybe i'm the dreamer that's been in many ways my policy up to now okay that the best regulator is the market the best regulator in economic in economic activity is the market and the best regulator in political matters is a political market that's called elections that's what that's what regulates you know you have a lousy government and people make lousy decisions well you don't need you know the wise men raised above the you know the the masses to decide what is good and what is bad let the masses decide let them vote every four years or whatever and they they throw you up by the way it happened to me there's life after political death there's actually political life i was reelected five or six times and this is my sixth turn so you know the the i believe in that i'm not sure i'm not sure that in economic matters in the geometric growth of tech companies that you'll always have the little guy the nimble mammal that will come out and slay the dinosaurs or overcome the dinosaurs which is essentially what you said yeah i wouldn't count out the little guy you wouldn't count out the little well i hope you're right well let me ask you about this market of politics so you have served six terms as prime minister over fifteen years in power let me ask you again human nature do you worry about the corrupting nature of power on you as a leader on you as a man not at all because i i think that the again the the thing that drives me is not is nothing but the mission that i took to assure the the survival and thriving of the state the jewish state that is its economic prosperity but its security and its ability to achieve peace with our neighbors and i'm i'm committed to it i think there's still there are many things that have been done there are a few big things that i can still do but it doesn't only depend on my sense of mission it depends on the market as we say it depends really on the will of the israeli voters and the israeli voters have decided to vote for me again and again even though i wield no power in the press no power in in in many quarters here and so on nothing i mean i am probably i'm going to be very soon the longest serving prime minister in the last half century in the western democracies but that's not because i i amass great political power in any of the institutions i remember i had a conversation with silvio berlusconi who recently died and he said to me about i don't know fifteen years ago something like that he said so baby how many how many of israel's television stations do you have and i said none he said you have none i have two have do you have i said none i have two yes he said no no but what you mean you don't have any that you control i said not only do i have none that i control they're all against me so he says so how do you win elections and you know with both hands tied behind your back and i said the hard way that's why you know i have the largest party but i don't have many more seats than i would have if i had a sympathetic voice in the media and israel is until recently was dominated completely by one side of the political spectrum that you know often vilified me not not me because they viewed me as representing basically the conservative voices in israel that are majority and so the idea that i'm an omnipotent authoritarian dictator is ridiculous i am i would say i'm not merely a champion of of democracy and democratization i'm i believe ultimately the decision is with the voters and the voters even though they've had you know they have constant constant press attacks they have chosen to put me back in so i don't believe in this thing of amassing the corrupting power of if you don't have elections if you don't have if you control the the means of influencing the voters i'd understand what you're saying but in my case it's exact opposite i have to constantly go in elections constantly you know with a disadvantage that the major media outlets are very violently sometimes against me but it's fine and i keep on winning so i i don't know what you're talking i would say the concentration of power lies elsewhere not here well you have been involved in several corruption cases how much corruption is there in israel and how do you fight it in your own party and in israel well you should ask a different question what's happened to these cases these cases have basically are collapsing and before our eyes the the you know there were there was recently an event in which the judges the three judges in in my case called in the prosecution and said you know your flagship the bribery charge so called bribery charge you know is gone it doesn't exist before a single a single defense witness was called and it sort of tells you that this thing is evaporating it's it's quite astounding even that i have to say was covered even by the mainstream press in israel because it's such an earthquake so you know a lot of these charges are not a lot these charges will prove to be nothing i always said listen i stand before the legal process i don't claim that i'm exempt from it in any way on the contrary i think the truth will come out and it's coming out and we see that not only that but with other things so i think it's kind of instructive that you know no no politician has been more vilified no none has been put to such you know what is it about a quarter of a billion shekels were used to scrutinize me scour my bank accounts sending people to the philippines into mexico into europe into america and looking at everybody using spyware the most advanced spyware on the planet against my associates blackmailing witnesses telling them you know think about your family think about your wife you know you better tell us what you want all that is coming out in the trial so i would say that most people now are not asking are are no longer asking including my opponents it's sort of trickling in as the as the stuff comes out people are not saying what did netanyahu do because he apparently did nothing what was done to him is something that people ask what was done to what was done to our democracy what was done in the attempt to put down somebody who keeps winning elections despite the handicaps that i described maybe we can maybe we can nail them by framing them and the one thing i can say about the the this court trial is that things are coming out and that's that's very good just objective things are coming out changing the picture so i would say the the attempt to brand me as corrupt is falling on its face but the thing that isn't being uncovered in the trial such as the use the use of spyware on a politician a politician's surroundings to try to shake them down in investigations put them in flee ridden cells for twenty one days invite their eighty four year old mother to investigations without cause bringing in their mistresses in the corridor shaking them down that's what people are asking that corruption is what they want corrected what is the top obstacle to peaceful coexistence of israelis and palestinians let's talk about the big question of peace in this part of the world well i i think the reason you have the persistence of the palestinian israeli conflict which goes back about a century is the persistent palestinian refusal to recognize a jewish state a nation state for the jewish people in any boundary that's why they opposed the establishment of the state of israel before we had a state and that's why they've opposed it after we had a state they opposed it when we were we didn't have judea and samaria the west bank in our heads and gaza they oppose it after we have it it doesn't make a difference it's basically their persistent refusal to recognize a jewish state in any boundaries and i i think their tragedy is that they've been commandeered for a century by leadership that refused to compromise with the idea of of zionism namely that the jews deserve a state in this part of the world the territorial dispute is something else you have a territorial dispute if you say okay you're living on this side we're living on that side let's decide where the border is and so on that's not what the argument is the palestinian society which is itself prangated but all the factions agree there shouldn't be a jewish state anywhere okay they just disagree between hamas that says oh well you should have it you know we should get rid of it with terror and the others are saying no we should also use political means to dissolve it so that is that is the problem so even as part of a two state solution they're still against the idea well they don't want a state next to israel they want a state instead of israel and they say if we get a state we'll use it as a springboard to destroy the the smaller israeli state which is what happened when israel unilaterally walked out of gaza and effectively established a hamas state there they didn't say oh good now we have you know our own territory our own state israel is no longer there let's build peace let's build you know economic projects let's enfranchise our people no they turned it in into a basically into a terror bastion for which they fired ten thousand rockets into israel when israel left lebanon you know because we had terrorist attacks from there then we had lebanon taken over by hezbollah a terrorist organization that seeks to destroy israel and and therefore every time we just walked out what we got was not peace we didn't give you know territory for peace we got territory for terror we gave it that's what we had and and that's what would happen as long as the the reigning ideology says we don't want israel in any border so the the idea of two states assumes that you'd have on the other side a state that wants to live in peace and not one that will be overtaken by iran and its proxies in two seconds and become a base to destroy israel and therefore i think that most israelis today if you ask them they're they're they're they'd say it's it's not gonna work in that concept so what do you do what do you do with the palestinians okay they're still there and i don't unlike them i don't want to throw them out i they're gonna be living here and we're gonna be living here in an area which is by the way just to understand the area the entire area of so called west bank and in israel is the width of the washington beltway more or less just a little more not much more you can't really divide it up you can't say well you're gonna fly in who controls the airspace well it takes you about two and a half minutes to cross it with a with a a regular you know seven four seven okay with the fighter plane it takes you a minute and a half okay so you're not how are you gonna divide the airspace well you're not gonna divide it israel's gonna control that airspace and the electromagnetic space and and so on so security has to be in the the hands of israel my view of how you solve this problem is that is a simple principle the palestinians should have all the powers to govern themselves and none of the powers to threaten israel which basically means that the responsibility for overall security remains with israel and from a practical point of view we've seen that every time that israel leaves a territory and and takes its security forces out of an area it immediately is overtaken by hamas or hezbollah or jihadists who basically are committed to the destruction of israel and also bring misery to the the palestinians or arab subjects so i think that that principle is less than perfect sovereignty because you're taking certain amount of powers sovereign powers especially security away but i think it's the only practical solution so people say ah but it's not a perfect state i said okay call it what you will call it you know i don't know limited sovereignty call it autonomy plus call it whatever you wanna call it but that's the reality and right now if you ask israelis across the political spectrum except the very hard left most israelis agree with that they don't really debate it so a two state solution where israel controls the security of the entire region we don't call it quite that i mean there are different names but the idea is yes israel controls security in the it's the entire area it's this tiny area between the jordan river and the sea i mean it's it's like you know you can walk it in not one afternoon if you're really fit you can do it in a in a day less less than a day i did so the expansion of settlements in the west bank has been a top priority for this new government people may harshly criticize this as contributing to escalating the israel palestine tensions yeah well what it can can you understand that perspective that this expansion of settlements is not good for this two state solution yeah i can understand i can understand what they're saying and they don't understand why they're wrong first most most israelis who live in judaism area live in in urban blocks and that accounts for about ninety percent of the of the population okay and everybody recognizes that those urban blocks are gonna be part of israel in any future arrangement so they're really arguing about something that has already been decided and agreed upon really by by americans by even by arabs many arabs they don't think that israel is gonna dismantle these these blocks you know you look outside the window here and within about a kilometer or a mile from here is you have jerusalem half of jerusalem grew naturally beyond the old nineteen sixty seven border so you're you're not gonna dismantle half of jerusalem that's not gonna happen and and most people don't expect that then you have the other ten percent scattered in tiny you know small communities and people say well you're gonna have to take them out why why remember that in pre nineteen sixty seven israel we have over a million and a half arabs here we don't say israel has to be ethnically cleansed from arabs in order to have from its arab citizens in order to have peace of course not jews can live among arabs and arabs can live among jews and what is what is being advanced by those people who say that we can't live in our ancestral homeland in these disputed areas nobody says that this is palestinian areas and nobody says that these are israeli areas we claim them they claim that we've only been attached to this land for oh thirty five hundred years but you know but it's a dispute i agree but i don't agree that we should throw out the arabs and i don't think that they should throw out the jews and if somebody said to you the only way we're gonna have peace with israel is to have an ethnically cleansed palestinian entity mhmm you know that that's outrageous if you said the only way you know you shouldn't have jews living in i don't know in suburbs of london or new york and so on i don't think that will play too well the world is actually advancing a solution that says that that jews cannot live among arabs and arabs cannot live among jews i i don't think that's the right way to do it and i i think there's a solution out there but i don't think we're gonna get to it which is less than perfect sovereignty which involves israeli security maintained for the entire territory by israel which involves not rooting out anybody not kicking out uprooting arabs or palestinians they're gonna live in enclaves in sovereign israel and we're going to live in probably in enclaves there probably through transportational continuity as opposed to territorial continuity that is you know for example you can have tunnels and overpasses and so on that connect the various communities we're doing that right now we're doing that right now and it it it actually works i think there is a solution to this it's not the perfect world that people think of because that model i think doesn't apply here if it applies elsewhere it's a question i don't think so but i think there's one other thing and that's the main thing that i've been involved in you know people said if you don't solve the palestinian problem you're not gonna get to the arab world you're not gonna have peace with the arab world remember the palestinians are about two percent of the arab world and the other you know the other ninety eight percent you're not gonna make peace with them and that's our goal and for a long time people accepted that after the initial peace treaties with egypt with prime minister begin of delikud and and president sadat of egypt and then with jordan between prime minister rabin and and king hussein for a quarter of a century we didn't have any more peace treaties because people said you gotta go through the palestinians and the palestinians they don't want a solution of the kind that i described or any kind except the one that involved the dissolution of the state of israel so we could wait another half century and i said no i mean i don't think that we should accept the premise that we have to wait for the palestinians because we'll have to wait forever so i decided to do it differently i decided to go directly to the arab capitals and to make the historic abraham accords and essentially reversing the equation not a peace process that goes inside out but outside in and we went directly to the the these countries and forged these these breakthrough peace accords with the united arab emirates with bahrain with morocco and with sudan and we're now trying to expand that in a quantum leap with saudi arabia what does it take to do that with saudi arabia with the saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman you know i'm a student of history and i read a lot of history and i read that you know in the versailles discussions after world war one president woodrow wilson said i believe in open covenants openly arrived at i have my correction i believed in open covenants secretly arrived at so there's we're not gonna advance a saudi israeli peace by having it publicly discussed and in any case it's a decision of the of the saudis if if they wanna do it but there's obviously a mutual interest so here's my view if we try to wait for the two percent in order to get to the ninety eight percent we're gonna fail and we have failed if we go to the ninety eight percent we have a much greater chance of persuading the two percent you know why because the two percent the palestinian hope to vanquish the state of israel and not make peace with it is based among other things on the on the assumption that eventually the ninety eight percent the rest of the arab world will kick in and destroy the jewish state help them dissolve or destroy the jewish state when that hope is taken away then you begin to have a turn to the realistic solutions of coexistence by the way they'll require compromise on the israeli side too and i'm you know i'm perfectly cognizant of that and willing to do that but i think a realistic compromise will be struck much more readily when the conflict between israel and the arab states the arab world is effectively solved and i think we're on that path it was a conceptual change just like you know i've been involved in a few i told you the conceptual battle is always the most difficult one and you know i had to fight this battle to convert a semi socialist state into a free market capitalist state and i have to say that most people today recognize the power of competition and the benefits of free markets so we also had to fight this battle that said you have to go through the you know the the the the palestinian straight s t r a i t to get to the other places there's no way to avoid this you know you have to go through this this impassable pass and i think that now people are recognizing that we'll go around it and probably circle back and that i think actually gives hope not only to have an arab israeli peace but circling back an israeli palestinian peace and obviously this is not something that you find in the you know in the sound bites and so on but but in the in the popular discussion of the press but that idea is permeating and i think it's the right idea because i think it's the only one that will work so expanding the circle piece just to linger on that requires what secretly talking man to man human to human to leaders of other nations and theoretically you're right theoretically okay well let me ask you another theoretical question on the circle of peace as a student of history looking at the ideas of war and peace what do you think can achieve peace in the war in ukraine looking at another part of the world if you if you consider the fight for peace in this part of the world how can you apply that to that other part of the world between russia and ukraine now i think it's one of the the savage horrors of history and one of the great tragedies that is occurring and let me say in advance that that if i have any opportunity to use my contacts to help bring about an end to this tragedy i'll do so i've had i know both leaders but i don't just jump in and and assume you know if there's be a desire at a certain point because the conditions have created the possibility of helping stop this this carnage then i'll do it and that's why i choose my words carefully because i think that may be the best the best thing that i could do look i i think what you see in ukraine is what happens if you have territorial designs on a territory by a country that has nuclear weapons and that to me you see the change in the equation now i think that people are loathed to use nuclear weapons and i'm not sure that i would think that the the russian side would use them with happy abandon i don't think that's the question but you see how the whole configuration changes when that happens so you have to be very careful on how you resolve this conflict so it doesn't well it doesn't go off the rails so to speak that's by the way the the the corollary is here we don't want iran which is an aggressive force with an just aggressive ideology of dominating first the muslim world and then eliminating israel and then becoming a you know global force having nuclear weapons it's totally different when they don't have it than when they do have it and that's why one of my main goals has been to prevent iran from having the means to the means of mass destruction which will be used atomic bombs which they openly say will be used against us and you can understand that how to bring about an end to ukraine i have my ideas i don't think i don't think it's worthwhile discussing them now because they might they might be required later on do you believe in the power of conversation since you have contacts with volodymyr zelensky and vladimir putin just leaders sitting in a room and discussing how the end of war can be brought about i think it's a combination of that but i think it's the question of interest and and whether you have to get both sides to to a point where they think that that conversation would lead to something useful i don't think they're there right now what part is of this is just basic human ego stubbornness all of this between leaders which is why i bring up the power of conversation of sitting in a room realizing we're human beings and then there's a history that connects ukraine and russia yeah i don't think they're in a position to enter a room right now realistically i mean you you can posit that it would be good if that could happen but entering the room is sometimes more complicated than what happens in the room and there's a lot of you know pre negotiation on the negotiation then you negotiate endlessly on the negotiation they're not even there it took a lot of work for you to get a handshake in the past it's an interesting question how did the piece the abraham accords how did that begin you know i mean the we had you know we had decades seventy years where they or sixty five years where these people you know would not meet openly with the or even secretly with the israeli leader yeah we had the the mossad making contacts with them all the time and so on but how do we break the ice to the top level of leadership well we broke the ice because i took a very strong stance against iran and the gulf states understood that iran is a formidable danger to them so we had a common interest and the second thing is that because of the economic reforms that we had produced in israel israel became a technological powerhouse that could help their nations not only in terms of anything they were just bettering the life of their peoples and the combination of the of the desire to have some kind of protection against iran or some kind of cooperation against iran and civilian economic cooperation came to a head when i gave a speech in the american congress which i didn't do lightheartedly i had to decide to challenge a sitting american president and on the the so called iranian deal which i thought would pave iran's path with gold to be an effective nuclear power that's what would happen so i went there and in the course of giving that speech before the joint session of congress our delegation received calls from gulf states who said we can't believe what your prime minister is doing he's challenging you know the president of the united states well i had no choice i mean because i thought my country's own existence was imperiled and remember we always understand through change of administrations that america under no matter what leadership is always the irreplaceable and indispensable ally of israel and we'll always remain that we can have arguments as we have but in the family as we say in the mishpoche you know it's the the family but nevertheless i was forced to take a stand that produced calls from gulf states that ultimately led to clandestine meetings that ultimately flowered into the the abraham accords then and i think we're at a point where the idea of ending the arab israeli conflict not the palestinian israeli conflict the arab israeli conflict can happen i'm not sure it will it depends on quite a few things but it could happen and if it happens it might open up the ending of the israeli islamic conflict remember the arab world is a small part it's an important part but it's there are large islamic populations and could bring about an end to the an historic enmity between islam and judaism it could be a great thing so i'm looking at this larger thing you know you can you can be hobbled by saying well well you know you've had this you know this hiccup in gaza or you know this this or that thing happening in in the palestinians i don't i don't it's important for us because we want security but i think the larger question is can we break out into a much wider peace and ultimately come back and make the the peace between israel and the palestinians rather than waiting to solve that and and never getting to the the to paint on the larger canvas i i wanna paint on the larger canvas and come back to the palestinian israeli conflict as you write about in your book what have you learned about life from your father my father was a great historian and well he taught me several things he said that the the the first condition for a living organism is to identify danger and time because if you don't you could be devoured you could be destroyed very quickly and that's the nature of human conflict in fact for the jewish people we didn't we lost the capacity to identify danger and time and we were almost devoured and destroyed by the nazi threat so when i see somebody parroting the nazi goal of destroying the jewish state i try to mobilize the country and the world in time because i think iran is a global threat not only a threat to israel that's the first thing the second thing is i once asked him before i got elected i said well what do you think is the most important quality for a prime minister of israel and he came back with a question what do you think and i said well you have to have vision and you have to have the you know the the flexibility of navigating and working towards that vision you know be flexible but understand where you're heading and he said well you need that for anything you need it for you know if you're a university president or if you're a leader of a corporation or anything anybody would have to have that i said alright so so what do you need for to be the the the leader of israel he he said he came back to me with a word that stunned me he said education you need a broad and deep education or you'll be at the mercy of your clerks that's what it is or the press or whatever you have to you have to be able to to do that now you know as i spent time in government re being reelected you know by by the the the people of israel i i recognize more and more how how right it was you you need to constantly ask yourself where's the direction we wanna take the country how do we achieve that goal but also understand that new disciplines are being added you have to learn all the time you have to learn all the time you have to add to your intellectual capital all the time kissinger said that he wrote that once you enter public life you begin to draw on your intellectual capital and you know it'll be depleted very quickly if if you stay a long time i disagree with that i think you have to constantly constantly increase your understanding of things as they change because because my father was right you need to broaden and deepen your education as you go along you can't just sit back and say well i studied some things in university or in college or in boston or at mit and that's enough you know i've done it no learn learn learn learn learn never stop and if i may suggest as part of the education i would add in a little literature maybe dostoevsky in the in in the plentiful of time you have as a prime minister to read well i read him but i'll tell you what i think is bigger than dostoevsky oh no well who's that not who's that but what's that mhmm i was dan rather came to see me with his grandson a few years ago and he asked me the the grandson asked me he was a student in in ivy league college and he said he's eighteen years old and he he wants to study to enter politics mhmm and he said what's what's the most important thing that i have to study to enter a political life and i said you have three things you have to study okay history history and history that's that's the fundamental discipline for political life but then you have to study other things study economics study politics and and so on and study study the military if you have if you i had an advantage because i spent some years there so i learned a lot of that but i had to acquire the other disciplines and you never acquire enough so read read read and by the way if i have to choose i read history history and history good works of history not lousy books last question you've talked about a survival of a nation mhmm you yourself are a mortal being do you contemplate your mortality do you contemplate your death are you afraid of death aren't you yes who is not i mean if you're a conscience if you're a a a being with conscience i mean one of the unhappy things about the human brain is that it can contemplate its own its own demise and so we have to we all make our compromises with this but i i think the question is what lives on what lives on beyond this and i think that you have to define how much of of posterity do you want to influence i cannot influence the course of humanity we all are specks you know little specks so that's not the issue but in my case i've devoted my life to a very defined purpose and that is to assure the future and security and i would say permanence but that is obviously a limited thing of the jewish state and the jewish people and i don't think one can exist without the other so i've devoted my life to that and i hope that in my time on this earth and in my years in office i'd have contributed to that well you had one heck of a life starting from mit to six terms as prime minister thank you for this stroll through human history and for this conversation it was an honor thank you and i hope you come back to us so many times it's remember it's the innovation nation it's a robust democracy don't believe all the stuff that you're being told it'll remain that it cannot be any other way and it's i'll i'll tell you the other thing it's the best ally of the united states and its importance is growing by the day because our cap capacities in the information world are growing by the day we need a coalition of the like minded smarts this is a smart nation and we share the basic values of freedom and liberty with the united states so the coalition of the smarts means israel is the sixth eye and america has no better ally alright now off mic i'm gonna force you to finally tell me who was gonna win elon musk or mark zuckerberg but that's that's a good time to end we ran out of time here i'll tell you outside thanks for listening to this conversation with benjamin netanyahu to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from mahatma gandhi an eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
