violent place what are some formative moments that you remember from that time south africa was so i grew up in par apartheid south africa but more specifically the fall of apartheid so it was it was the eighty i was a teenager in the eighties and our community would would part of our social life frankly was the anti apartheid protests and to go be with white people black people kind of mix mixing it all together the most formative experience is frankly how much i appreciate a place like america where we have value for human life so that was a country where where human life was not valued it was a it's a weird thing to come from that to here where where we we take it so seriously if someone dies in a war or something like that and we just didn't take it seriously in south africa people died people were killed i saw someone killed in front of me was was getting off a train and it's a very violent train known known for violence we were stupid kids we didn't really listen to our parents we went on this train and the doors opened and i had people trying to get off the train and in front of me two black people one black guy just stabbed this knife in the side of this other black guy's head you know like what the fuck and you just i've i'm i've i gotta get off the train how old were you at this time probably sixteen or seventeen and i gotta get off the train and everyone is trying to get me to get off because you know they're all behind me so i step off and i step into the pool of blood one foot and then i just walk for about a hundred paces while the stickiness of the blood just kinda for my sneakers just on one foot just like leaves a footprint behind me and you just walk on you just walk on did the others walk on as well everyone walked on that's an interesting point you make underlying the violence is a kind of philosophy that human life is disposable the individual life is disposable i mean that underlies many ideologies you know i grew up in the soviet union the value of human life was lower there than in the united states the value of the individual in the united states is really high yeah there's probably an index you can put together like yeah right exactly per per nation that that's a really interesting way to put it because violence is much easier on a mass scale suffering causing suffering on a mass scale is much easier when you don't value the human life i've heard this before where which i think i agree with is when someone is killed someone is is someone's taken from our lives the the vacuum that it creates the social vacuum is extraordinarily painful and and it truly is true i mean if someone in my community passes away it's very very sad for me and when you go to a place where where you know live grow up in a place where where that human life is not valued there's there's something about the there's a little bit little bit less of the social vacuum created because everyone is kind of expecting everyone to potentially be taken out at any moment but then there's also a beauty to it because there's a much more of a celebrate celebratory element when we my my cousin russ and i we again we're stupid kids we shouldn't be doing this but we go into the townships where all of lot of the violence would be happening we really didn't see most of the violence there it was in in these more protests and and so forth but but the the the there's a joy that also comes from lower value of human life there's a real joy like everyone is like well i mean it's beautiful it's we we have dinner with black friends you know friends with their family we were still pretty young and and there was just a real joy to it when you accept mortality yeah you can really enjoy life you can really enjoy life more life i mean i think there's actually has to be extra quite a nice insight i i've never really put it that way but i think that's right actually i think you you just chill out a bit mhmm take things a little less seriously because life does end for everybody it does right and if you just head on and accept that fact yeah you can just enjoy every single moment and let go of this attachment and just enjoy the moment real i do love that we all live longer and so forth but we should live longer with the with the goal of joy mhmm and the goal of happiness and peace not some some form of misery that you choose to attach yourself to maximize joy maximize joy that's right there's a story that walter isaacson writes about where elon got beat up pretty bad and you were there and then you also had to watch your dad yell at elon for an hour calling him worthless all those kinds of things you said it was the worst memory of your life what do you make of such cruelty what do you remember from that time i mean it was horrible i think you know coming back to the point of low value of human life they tried to kill him it wasn't wasn't there was no holding back so i just watched someone at least one just one but but there was a main person and then there was a few others that that piled in they they just they tried to kill him in front of me we were eating sandwiches on a on a staircase at at the school out in outdoor staircase and i just had to i i they they were not coming after me and then i just had to watch and i couldn't help it was one of the saddest most difficult experiences it just was it's just awful just like that life can end yeah could've been you yeah i think so i've had a i've had a life life near near death experience where i almost died i went i was in two thousand ten and i think i think that and i i broke my neck and i i can go to that story in a moment but this was this was different this was this was this comes back to the low value of human life part where if someone had killed my brother if that person had beat him to death which which he was trying to do life would have gone on you know is that that's like an insane thought in an american who may be in some tough neighborhoods but for the most part it's it's another thing yeah the brutality of that the the mundaneness of the brutality yeah it makes you think of all the places in the world that that's happening exactly exactly beautiful people that just disappear i always say to people who who have an opinion about america that you know this is a really bad country or or whatever and i say look please go try another country before you say that not to say that america can't get better but please go try another country because not having that perspective or having a perspective that that i don't know that'll catch up on their shoulder about the country that they're in okay go go try another country and then come back and tell me and pick any country it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be some you know very violent country you could pick any country and and and you just realize that actually the the world doesn't think the same way that america thinks and you're you're gonna just learn a perspective that i think gives you a better way to critique where we live in america yeah it's humbling you said that your dad was a roller coaster of affection and then verbal abuse walter isaacson quotes barack obama who said someone once said that every man is trying to live up to his father's expectations or make up for his father's mistakes and i suppose that may explain my particular malady is part of that ring true for you what i thought you were gonna say was we thought you were gonna end the sentence was live up to my father's expectations mhmm that's what most people say but then you said the second part which is make up for his mistakes mhmm and i think that's actually that one is that one rings true for me he was really the he's still he's still alive but he but i don't connect i'm not connected to him but he's very he taught he taught me the phrase i used to have was he taught me what not to do so i still actually learned a lot mhmm what what kind of human not to be what kind of actions not to take and so that kind of closer to living up to his mistakes but it's but my father is such a train wreck that it's not really mistakes it's like intentional actions of what not to do okay don't do that but there's still the trauma of that you know it has an effect on the human psychology and can permeate their time so it has probably complex indirect effects on who you are the good and the bad there's a critique that my friends give me which is when they're talking to me i kinda just drift away that just i'm still looking at them i'm still nodding might even respond to their to their to them in their conversation but i'm actually not there mhmm and and i i've realized that actually that i grew up because my father would just verbal for abuse is is one way to say it it is abuse but it's more just verbal diarrhea for you for hours and constantly saying do you understand like he wants to make sure that i'm paying attention so i i train myself to look like i'm paying attention but i'm not to disappear to some place disappear to some place wherever that is yeah and and i do i do that less and less over time but i but that path has been paved somewhere in your mind at childhood so it it could be easy to walk down it you and elon were close growing up you're still close what did you learn from each other how did you compliment each other yeah i think we are we are a good complement my for i'll talk talk for myself first my my my strength is definitely on the social side i love i love the gathering place mhmm and i love putting people together in person and i love to have vibrant debates and conversations i've been doing that forever and including some fun parties and stuff where where i bring people together and i really kinda want people to have fun and be but be vulnerable in a in a in a not just like silly partying just but actually like let's all connect the definition for me of a good party is people laugh and cry mhmm like i wanna people i wanna have people have an have an emotional connection i go to burning man every year and that is there's no question you will cry at some point during burning man no small talk no small talk oh yes exactly no small talk yeah you're totally right on like most parties not parties but most events you go to are like clubs these sort of nightclubs yeah and i never go to those and my my joke is it's why would i wanna go to a place where i pay to shout small talk in the dark that's a good one that's what it feels like i the only the reason i enjoy those places is the full absurdity of exactly that right it's totally absurd what are what are we doing what is this what is this like but i have so my compliment from my brother was just bringing joy and social connection mhmm and he's truly he's an he's an engineering genius i've i've worked with him forever and we do complement each other you just came out with a cookbook by the way thank you for giving me my first cookbook i feel legit i love the i got it first cookbook i'm gonna keep it keep it on the counter and it's gonna give me legitimacy if anyone comes over hey listen i'm basically a chef now that's right exactly when did you first fall in love with cooking i started cooking when i was eleven years old my mom is just she's she's wonderful but she she's self admittedly a a a bad cook but but at the time it was a it was and i think anyone with kids goes through this their your kids just want like something that like spaghetti bolognese or a burger or or something and my mom would do brown bread plain yogurt and boiled squash you know like the absolute most disgusting things that a child could imagine eating and so i i said yeah can i cook and she said yes if you wanna cook no problem so i went to the grocery store and i i've back in those days there's a butcher separate to the grocery store and i went to the butcher and i said you know what can i cook and he put pulled out a chicken and he said this is this is the easiest recipe for you just put it on a pan in an oven a hot oven because back then the ovens weren't necessarily like four hundred degrees or four fifty or whatever and put it in a hot oven for one hour and enjoy that was it and so i i went home and actually i also bought some french fries i'll tell you that as well so i was looking at my i'm i'm a kid of course i want french fries so the roast chicken was french fries and the chicken came out and it was just fantastic it was absolutely fantastic that's incredible by the way yeah yeah you didn't screw it up the first time first of all i think that also kicks off the magic yeah okay like you if you screw it up and you're like maybe this is not for me yeah so for me it really did did kick it off you started that started out on a high note yeah right exactly but i but i tell the french fry part which was a disaster so i cooked the french fries but i didn't heat the oil first so i just put the potatoes in the oil and i waited for it to heat up and i just was throwing up later that night you can't your body can't ingest that much because it sucks the oils in oh oh and so that was a disaster but but at the time it tasted good the meh the the the real magic which i also found was wonderful was when i cooked you know my brother my sister my mom all very very busy very intense people would sit down mhmm and we would have a meal together and i was like wow this is a powerful it's a very powerful thing that i've now got where in no other way could i have that connection sector but no in no other way can we sit down and just talk about things or talk about whatever's on our mind or just to just not even talk just to have just to be in in at the table together and i've done that now week through my whole life my kids still for my family and we will do gratitudes at the beginning of our meal and it's just i think that what kept me cooking what made my love of cooking so great was was actually the fact that we would sit down together and be be present with each other and i'm also just also hard with that too so i i also get to be present mhmm what is that about food that like brings people together and not just together but like really together where you're like paying attention right like what is that what what is why is it food like what what else does that sometimes maybe alcohol can do that which is a kind of food i guess is pretty basic alcohol is different because you're you're usually standing when you're doing alcohol so you're yeah you're like you're socializing but it's kinda you're you're just gonna stay more in the small talk zone yeah right whereas if you sit down yeah and i've i see this in my restaurant in the kitchen in boulder where we we have every viewpoint or we go to denver every viewpoint when when when when when when chicago every viewpoint and the physical presence of someone being with right there is people are just they're just they're just very different absolutely different to what they are online i think we all know the difference between you know you send an email to someone and they they they misunderstand the email mhmm right that and you know oh if i just had talked to the person it would have been fine well this is now happening at scale you know with all of these these these what do you call it trolling or whatever and i i have i've i've sat at a at the bar and i've had a hardcore trump supporter and i and i'm just i'm just curious just like listen tell me what i'm not a trump supporter but but like tell me more mhmm and and and it actually draws the conversation out because you're there for an hour or longer so there's there's no rush to get the answer mhmm and i think that's a big difference i've had one time where just a just a couple months ago i had someone i was sitting at the community table we have a community table in the restaurant and and he was i didn't know him too well but he asked me did i know that nine eleven was a conspiracy and it didn't really happen it didn't happen yeah mhmm and i was like so i actually i was at nine eleven i was i was i mean i was i was four i was like i was there physically there so it's like no allegedly there's no doubt in my mind okay but i but i but i didn't wanna but i didn't wanna interrupt his his what he had to say so i let him talk for five minutes six minutes seven minutes and again you're there for a while so you're not in a rush to to jump in and argue and then i shared that i was there and i think because i had been willing to listen to him he was willing to listen to me and he i don't know if he changed his mind said he doesn't change my mind but but it was actually a pretty cool conversation to kinda get into each other's mind but i think you connect on a different level not on the level of like the the conspiracy but on the level of basic humanity yes like that's where you really connect on and then it's almost becomes interesting and fun that you can exchange ideas even crazy ideas out there ideas and kinda play with them like yeah we humans are good at that yeah exactly i like the i like the term play with them because what what you're not trying to do is shut the conversation down mhmm you're also not trying to talk down on me yeah you oh yeah exactly like because you know let me just be nice while i totally disagree with this person mhmm you can do that for a few minutes you can't do that for two hours and there's something like about food that completely it it i don't know it must be evolutionary it makes us vulnerable in a way that even just standing there for a prolonged period of time doesn't there's something about you know like when the animals gather to the water or whatever yeah right like this kind of experience where you're just like alright let's let's just acknowledge together that we need sustenance yeah and somehow that kinda grounds us to like we're just we're just a bunch of descendants of apes here just kinda like grateful to be alive yeah frankly and grateful to be consuming this thing which keeps us alive and in that context you can talk about all kinds of stuff you you can discuss flat earth and enjoy it absolutely ab absolute in fact one of my favorite things to do is is is you do like a jeffersonian style dinner like let's say five or six people sometimes you can people will break off in individual conversations that's actually when things break down mhmm so that's when you kinda go back to small talk like oh i'm stuck next to this guy i'm just gonna do a little small talk mhmm what you need to do to really create a great conversation is one conversation at the table and that's where you know i there'll be some some simple questions that i'll say i'll say you know what's your middle name and you'll be amazed at the stories you get from that but it's it's about creating vulnerability yeah so they're like oh no one's ever asked me that before so then they they become vulnerable and then i then it's something as simple as what's the most fun thing you've done recently and what is the most fun thing you're looking forward to mhmm and i have gotten into with those prom prompts i've gotten into hours long discussions on god mhmm i've gotten into hours long discussions on love i've gotten into hours long discussions on anger it's actually amazing when people are just asked a question like what's the most fun thing you've done lately well why would anger come up well actually they're they're in a vulnerable place so it'll just kind of come out of them so you get to see this you get to see this at the kitchen in you said boulder denver chicago yeah and we're gonna open in austin in austin that's what i saw when when in october is the goal in october is the goal well i mean speaking of characters and human beings austin is fascinating i've i forget how long ago and a couple months ago i was just sitting in a bar and some the the two people were talking and they were talking about marxism and it turns out that they're anarchocommunists which is the thing and i got into this conversation communist that likes drugs that's a good question to ask i think i know some of those anyway they were beautiful people i think they're they're local from austin i don't you know i don't know the depth of their personal experience of the different kinds of communist like systems but it was fascinating to listen to and then get to know them and the the humanity the weirdness like the characters it's just i mean i love it one of the reasons i really love austin i decided to be here as just the the cliche thing of keep austin weird i mean there's a lot of weird characters i think i think that i've talked to a lot of australians who've been here forever and i'm like man you gotta hold us accountable we gotta keep this place weird hundred percent which makes the restaurant seem great because you have all these characters come in yeah it's it's it's great so i look forward to that but you were saying like you get to see humans in real life interact that's one of the beautiful things yeah over food in the book you write picasso once said the meaning of life is to find your gift the purpose of life is to give it away then you wrote that you believe food is a gift we give ourselves three times a day can you explain that the gift yeah it's actually i think it's one of my most powerful life lessons is is we we have to eat so it's it's not it's not like you have a choice you have to eat and so what what i choose to do is i choose to make it a gift to myself each for each meal and most of the time the best gift is with friends with with family so we'll have to cook some scrambled eggs in the morning with my daughter or we'll have dinner with the our family so for me it's a it's a gift we give ourselves three times a day you know at least but for the most part three times a day let's make it a good one what makes it a good one to you like what what aspect makes it a good one well first definitely eating with with people so that makes it a good one so eating eating as a in a in a restaurant or or it doesn't have to be my restaurant we have the energy of of people around you energy of the town people you don't know creates a little bit of a a a vibe that you may you mentioned the the watering hole analogy that animals like sipping at the water but there's an there's an energy to that because they're also like looking around going is am i just about to be eaten yeah right so there's they're all in it together but we need to have water yeah but there's also a little bit of tension as well in the background and i think that's what restaurants do it's a very very subtle version of that you're in a room with strangers yeah and you're yeah you're a little cluster okay fine you you guys are connected in it yeah but you're in a room with strangers and it's just something that adds that energy to to the meal yeah you're a little bit wondering like what does everyone else think about our little cluster right like are we too loud or or or or just you also just people are random so something random could happen and also depending on your personality if you're an extrovert maybe you wanna show off to the other cluster you're right exactly yeah absolutely totally right i mean you know look at the cowboy hat i i mean actually i'll take my hat off when i wanna have a quiet meal and i can leave my hat on when i'm oh so you're aware of the lava i'm aware of the effect it has yeah absolutely yeah everyone turns in the night that's right and then it's back to the watering hole because when you wear a cowboy hat you you just might actually not yeah yeah i'm i'm like they're gonna come they're gonna get me first at noon i love it i gotta i gotta tell the story so the the to talk to the the the craziness of being of being in the restaurant world where you know you're sitting at a table and anything can happen in the restaurant so there's one time it was like fifteen years ago the this guy comes up to us and says we'd like to propose to his wife his to his girlfriend and and and so we we said okay cool that's we've done this before make sure it's all set up six pm kind of reservation so she shows up and we we give her a glass of champagne and just to sit yeah we didn't obviously didn't wanna spoil the surprise so we're just doing everything we can but then he doesn't then he doesn't arrive and they were like oh man now we're like don't don't leave can we get you another glass of champagne we're doing everything we can because the guy was obviously earnest earlier we're just is he stuck in traffic or whatever and out coming through the back door of the restaurant which is you're not allowed to come through the back door of the restaurant a marching band from the school of the university yeah like comes through the restaurant you know full on brass band and the whole thing and and you know he gets down and he proposes and it's it's it's it's it's it's beautiful shirt but it's also like chaos man this is chaos this is insane and we would never have said yes to this if he'd actually told us what he was gonna do well sometimes in life you have to do it and apologize you do it and apologize yeah but that talks to that kind of what's the crazy thing that could happen in a yeah it it's subtle but it's but it's still there so in two thousand four you opened the kitchen it's an american bistro restaurant what was it like what's it like running a restaurant the good the bad and ugly what's the what's the easy what's the fun and what's the hard i think the thing that i absolutely love restaurant is the the tangible reaction from from people and you you know you also kinda know when you screwed it up mhmm and you also know when you got it right so even it's kind of a weird way to say this but even if the customer's unhappy you know whether you got it right or wrong it's not just about the food you're making but it's about the person's psychological state yeah and you'll even you'll you'll do something that you're like you'd know that that was not done well and their psychological state is in they're just in a very happy place and they love it and you're like interesting you know like that's not how i would have reacted to that dish yeah and then the other way around you're like no i got that right and that that person is just like really unhappy today yeah and it's so hard to read humans because you have to if you got it right that can look a million different ways depending on the emotional roller coaster that human is living through yeah like i've been some very low points and i've gone to like a restaurant alone and just sitting there and be truly happy was just the zen aspect of it mhmm and it was just a great like a great steak or something like this and maybe to other people around me would look like i'm very unhappy just because i'm in in within my within myself with your your day yeah yeah within myself but i'm truly happy within that struggle so yeah it's interesting but you can kinda tell yeah you could tell and but you mentioned being at the bar one of the most gift the the the most gifted bartenders really understand that you know it's it it goes beyond but what's also great about a restaurant is it goes beyond the one time experience that you walk in and you have that experience is the good bartenders they they remember you yeah oh you were in a few months ago and this this is kinda your thing you might need a little time mhmm and other other people will come in and they want a conversation yeah or other people come in and they're going through a divorce and they just wanna be sad for a moment yeah like a scotch yeah and it's like it's amazing what you learn in the in the restaurant world to just be connected to humanity yeah what is that about bars that's a different experience you said the the the table the the communal the table is when you connect with people learn about each other bars you can sometimes do that you can talk left and right but but you have the freedom to always break break free like you can say oh okay but i'm gonna go back to my meal so it's kinda like the it's like a it's a friend you can turn on and off at any time mhmm because the bartender knows that they're trained like if you want attention i'm gonna give it to you if you don't i'm gonna i'm gonna stay away if you if you wanna be chatty i'm gonna be chatty if you wanna be completely in your head i'll leave you in your head but there's also strangers kinda next to you that you kinda there's a feeling with a bar that you're kind of alone together yeah right and you can reach out yeah you can add some conversation yeah or you can choose not to and you can exit quickly you can exit you get exactly it's a really good exit so so bars are are wonderful and i love going to a bar by myself after work might might have a scotch might even not even have alcohol just have something and i just and maybe have a snack or something before dinner because i'm gonna go home and have dinner with with the family and that that twenty minutes is just a an amazing state change from daytime to nighttime whereas if i went straight home i'm like still in my head and i'm just trying to trying to get grounded and i'm just not i'm not as pleasant of a person so i the that's another powerful use of a bar it's just like a transition time but i mean it would be remiss not to mention the other use of the bar which is like when you're going through some shit in life and you just go i mean that's sort of the it's the cliche thing i've been so so i'm a roller sword exactly the melt but like the bar makes the melancholy somehow like rich and beautiful and like it's you feel heard yeah you in the silence yes yes you feel heard you you and like like i said earlier like the the people going through a divorce they don't know where else to go yeah this is these are mostly men sometimes women will do it but mostly men will do this and women are i've other ways of processing it but they just they want a place to be sad they want a place where they could feel comfortable talking about it if they want they're certainly not gonna go into too much detail but they just wanna say something yeah and the bartender is there for them yeah you don't know where to go you don't know where to go and exactly the bar the bar yeah you're right like it for for men especially is a place to just go yeah and just i don't know what is that i mean what is that i'll be honest i still do it myself where if i'm at home and i've you know don't don't have a work thing that i gotta deal with and i don't have kids and i don't have my wife or a family around i'm i i don't often cook for myself i i actually love going to a bar by myself i have a glass of red wine and i have a you know i usually don't have a starter appetizer i just a like a main meal and i just take in the energy of the space it was my restaurant someone else's restaurant i just take in the energy and it's so much so much better than being home and turn the tv on no no no no no i i wanna be out in the restaurant i wanna feel the energy of the town the other thing that restaurants teach me is the they're the front lines of of the economy or what's what's a better word for it just like the front front lines of the energy of of of how things are going oh in in like of a peoples in general like it doesn't necessarily mean this part of town but it could be the entire society exactly so you can you can go into a restaurant and i'll use a simple example and then why is the restaurant empty there's a football game going on and that's they peep peep there's such a large number of people who wanna watch that game that the restaurant is quiet or it might be like another like world series or something and you're like wow that's so interesting you can actually watch in in america of course american humanity you can watch them move in their patterns just by being in the restaurant yeah yeah and then another time you might be in a restaurant and it's just jamming and it's a monday night and you're like what what what is the energy that created this on a monday night and maybe even on a cold february monday night what is it mhmm and sometimes you can't find out but you could feel it and it's a it's like it's my it's my front lines of humanity that i that i also just really love about the restaurants yeah it could be empty it could be full empty bars there's a magic to those too yeah you could still feel that energy i don't know i actually prefer empty bars than than full ones it's just you and the bartender i mean some of my greatest experience is just the quiet bar it's just me and the bartender and they're doing their thing and they've seen so many i've almost like through osmosis somehow feel the stories that that bartender has seen has felt has heard yeah and all that kind of stuff i mean that it's it's not to be sort of like spiritual about it but it seems like it's in the walls or something like there's the history is felt and then some of these bars are actually many in europe like this but there's a couple in new york city few hundred years old and you you you and they're still operating nonstop for that long and man you feel it yeah let me ask you some questions about ingredients what's your favorite ingredient to cook with for me cooking is an art right so it'd be like asking me what's my favorite favorite paint color to use or is it doesn't it's not that it there it isn't like there isn't one it's more like when there is one it really is one you know like there's peaches on the on the cover of this cookbook those peaches that those were in august colorado peaches it just doesn't get any better than that on that day at that moment that was the best that was the bit but that only lasts for a week yeah and then they don't taste so great yeah but damn are they so good in that moment and you just can't stop wanting to use that ingredient they look really good they're so good what's your favorite fruit i'm a i love veggies and fruit what's your favorite fruit i love a smoothie bowl so i do sort of berries raspberries but i but but i use fruit more in the form of a smoothie bowl than i eat fruit that often i like it i like an apple or banana but for most part i prefer like the blended not me i love the way you casually said it like an apple for me for me apple is pretty great for me it's a problem i think probably cherry's number one probably what do they call it granny smooth apples number two those are great but try it when sometime come to colorado in august and when you try those peaches it is like heaven has arrived in your mouth mhmm it is so ridiculously good but just for a week in august just for a week you can't have it all year long okay what about veggies you wrote that chef hugo that you worked with the cofounder of the kitchen with taught you the power of a good vegetable yeah what's the power of a good vegetable so i've trained in new york right as a french chef but it wasn't very much ingredients focused it wasn't very much sourcing focused he came from the river cafe in london which is one of the nine the ogs of the farm to table and still going strong today and he he taught me the the value of getting to know farmers and getting to know vegetables from that farm versus vegetables from that farm and they're actually different the soil's a little different where they're the way they grow it a little different it's the opposite of the industrial machine where everything went needs to look exactly the same and sometimes you'll get carrots that are kinda ugly and deformed but there's much sweeter than the carrots you get for other purposes so you'd make the carrot puree out of that and then you'd take carrots that are that are more typical in shape and size you might roast them for for for dinner so the the it's the appreciation for vegetables in general i i probably would say carrots is my favorite just because i've that was an example of one where i've i've really had to learn how to use the the the the different types of carrots that come from around from all of our farms and it's fun you know it's a fun ingredient if you just went to the whole foods or just went to a grocery store and you just got exactly the same carrot every time less fun mhmm but go to a farmer's market and see what you get and you'll you'll see they're quite different yeah carrot for me is probably number one i have rigorous detailed rankings for fruit and veggies that's amazing that we'll get into no i'm just kidding well i am the kind of person that would have like a spreadsheet for that that's true right but i'm mostly just making fun of myself but i do love carrots i wish they weren't so full of carbs but yeah i'm not i'm just not anti carbs you know i think the anti carb yeah yeah yeah yeah i think they play a role you know like i i have a great friend who's an amazing doctor and he did some tests for me and everything and and turns out i have a gluten allergy and i was like okay so what that means is i shouldn't eat gluten he's like yeah it's like okay but i also have hay fever and that that means i should not go out into nature mhmm so i was like no i think i'm gonna go out into nature and maybe what i'll do on bread and pastas is i'll or i like the true carbs i'll i'll just have it when it's really good mhmm because when it's really good it's really good and you don't wanna miss that most of the time okay find some crummy bread whatever like i can skip that part but i find all of these diets are like no none none of this or super this super that i i i wonder if they're just like like people are just looking for some something to hang on to but these diets have been around forever and if they work then we would know that yeah i think one of the biggest problems with diets is it adds stress when you do have that perfect bowl of pasta and if you're if you have categorized yourself as a low carb eating person you might be very stressed about enjoying this thing when you should just let go let go that's just your cheat day or whatever yeah yeah and i've heard that and actually i i i i i have friends who do that their cheat day and i say to them i'm only gonna hang out with you on your cheat day because that's when you're having fun yeah i i mean i i would say like for me there's things that make me feel really good but they're not rules they're not they're they're like go to favorites now speak like in terms of diet and so on for example i've mostly been eating once a day oh wow for for the longest time but that's not a rule yeah like it's it's completely flexible and i mostly have been eating very low carb yeah but you must be eating a lot of food in that one meal yeah it's not you know because it's usually a very sort of meat heavy it's not like portions are not that big so your body needs food yeah body needs food so you're talking about like two thousand calories what you find out is like that dinner is like the most social time of the day yeah i mean i have kids in the morning so if you have kids it's for sure a morning experience but if you don't then you're right yeah but like you said i i deviate you know i'm more afraid of missing the per for the perfect dessert the perfect breakfast the perfect bowl of pasta pizza all that kind of stuff and then i don't think of it as a cheat day i think it's well if you're eating one meal a day you can eat whatever you like well well like i i wanna make clear that it's not one meal a day always and i'm like this very strict thing right it's you always have to be open to the experience to the new experience yeah otherwise you do miss out it's just like you said hay fever like i think if you wanna be really safe you should never leave your home yes just wrap wrap we learned during covid if you wrap yourself in cotton wool in your basement you're not going to die from covid you might die from a lot of other things of pure misery yeah well you might live forever we don't know but it certainly doesn't maximize the joy of whatever whatever makes life worth living it doesn't maximize that yeah exactly you wrote in the book that anthony bourdain was one of your heroes mhmm can you speak to what inspired you about him yeah he wrote a book called kitchen confidential in the nineties i was in cooking school at the time it was so he romanticized the kit the cooking in the restaurant so well his writing is great so he kinda got me into like oh that's cool i i kinda wanna do that that was it was it was it was cool so i you know got into cooking school got more engaged in it and i and i was like this had this fomo feeling of i wanted to experience what it's like to be in in the back of when you're in cooking school you are you're in the back of they had a restaurant we would serve people but it's not the same thing as actually being in a like a real restaurant it's like you're in a submarine with with you know your your teammates and you gotta win tonight mhmm like it's a real it's a real energy and so that that was a big inspiration i followed him over he was so sad that he he he he chose to end his life but i also had met with him a few times not not like one on one over dinner or anything but just like met with him and and i just felt this love for for food and truly it's just love for food he gave the advice of don't be afraid get excited and cook with love yeah i've used that phrase especially the cook with loved one i mean when you know one of the things about which we talked about this earlier where you get quick tangible feedback from a customer when you're in the restaurant i know when i didn't put love into that dish i know when one of my line cooks did not put love into that part of the dish i know when that expert person did not put love into looking at double checking the dish before putting it on the table i i you just know and and cook with love is when you do it for your family oh actually especially when you do it for your family the food doesn't does not be perfect but you're cooking with love that's why you love scrambled eggs i do that it's that's in the book kimball's scrambled eggs yes you promised to make me scrambled eggs and i'm gonna hold you to it that's great a cooking school you mentioned the french culinary institute i heard it was a a bit of a rough experience in parts i would call it it's it's not a rough experience in that in a beautiful way yeah yeah it's exactly it's not like i'm a victim of it it's yeah it's it's rough in that they intentionally make it rough so the the school costs the same price as harvard to go to you show up you have to it's an eighteen month program you are allowed to drop out at any time you don't get your money back twenty five people started six people graduated and the people who graduated i graduated but man it was there were times where i'm like i i i can't handle this i mean i would literally say to to to my friends oh i gotta go to a cookies call i'm gonna go get screamed at for the next six or seven hours yeah and i had this little french chef who was my nemesis does he still live in your head somewhere still lives in my head exactly he totally does he's like five foot two or something and and i remember him screaming so much at me that this he's like the short guy i'm six five the spittle would land on my face nice and i would just have to sit there or stand there and take it it was a very humbling experience i did learn though that it just that's it's intentionally rough so i took a little bit of the edge of it one day when that same chef had come over to me and said move over a little bit and then i moved over and he took my carrots whatever and started just chopping everything it clucked perfectly and then he said okay now you just can come back and then he went over to someone else and started screaming at them saying that look even kimball can do this and you can't do this and i was like this whole thing's like a psych psycho game yeah so it did take the edge off when i realized there was yeah like the guy the guy was intentionally trying to break you down and they do this apparently in the army i'm i've not been in the army but they they they need you to they need to break you down everything you know is worthless so that then we can teach you and you can come out of it with with what actually we want you to know are there specific technical lessons you remember you learned from that sort of how to cut carrots or how to approach food how to prepare food how to think about food how to carry yourself in the kitchen yeah all of those things i think that the one of the most beautiful lessons was actually scrambled eggs so the there's different layers of chefs so they're all master chefs they're all very well known people and everything but but alain soltner was one of the chief like main main guys mhmm and he just passed away from masterchef and everything kinda stopped when he would show up in the kitchen and he would teach very few things and all of the other chefs who would you know the same ones that were screaming at us just like it was like the red sea parting like they have total respect for this human and yeah he can do whatever he wants and the one of the things he wanted to teach was how do you make an omelette a french omelette mhmm and it's really fundamentally the same thing it's a soft scrambled egg that you that you fold and the love that he put into the time with us and of course he's a legend there were moments like that where i'm like wow okay he he also he also just like the other chefs he didn't have any concern berating anyone so he berated our master chefs nice saying i don't trust these people to teach you how to make scrambled eggs so i'm gonna do it instead what i mean can you speak to that because you know a lot of people here in this would be like scrambled eggs like why do you need to be a master chef to to really make scrambled eggs it's a it's a well first of all for me and and it's it's a it's a learning journey forever so so i make i make scrambled eggs i mean i must've made it ten ten thousand times or more or whatever so it's like gerald dreams of sushi kimball dreams of scrambled eggs pretty much okay so i will i will wake up and be held accountable my by my kids to make scrambled so so this happens every morning and it's i i know all the steps muscle memory level kind of steps either how much i well i know it and then i'll cook it and it's very meditative for me because you have to focus so most scrambled eggs soft scrambled eggs recipes are ten fifteen minutes to get them to that that perfect softness mhmm and the the the recipe that i got from chef chef alain was was something that you do in ninety seconds mhmm but it requires total focus like if you like look up for a second you're gonna miss you're going to miss the the the perfect moment where you have to stop and get those eggs out of the pan because once the because the pan the eggs will keep cooking and so it's this meditation and it's sometimes you hit it like perfectly mhmm but most times could have been a little softer could have been a little firmer could have been a little bit more salt could have been a little bit more pepper and so so what's really fun about the morning is my kids are kinda into it so they're sort of like we we critique the eggs yeah every morning do they have a rating system we're back to the spreadsheet of a it's more like and again it also come back to how do people feel right so my kids kids could be in a bad mood and they can be grumpy it's just like a michelin star system like wait no no there's no it's it's more like oh yeah i i like my eggs a little more gooier or or yesterday it was this way with a little bit more salt a little less little less salt salt is usually the one that is because not all salts are are are equal so if you are used to working with a certain kind of salt and then you're you're just are forced for somebody to run out of salt to use some use some other salt you you actually don't know how to use it you really you need really you want to have the same salt all the time they have a page on salt in the book which is fascinating salt is you gotta get to know your salt you gotta you gotta love yourself and you gotta use it over and over and over again yeah and it will teach you how to use that salt by you know your own palate will tell you how salty you like things but if you change it up and you mix up a whole bunch of salt yeah you've now multiplied your learning path so for me i my favorite salt is is kosher salt and i like to use that all the time and if if i ever change it i might sprinkle a little bit of maldon salt just a crunchy sort of a flaky salt but it's more for for that at when you're actually eating texture yeah it gives you texture as well as salt exactly you wouldn't use it on scrambled eggs but but if you switch out your salts it's a different weapon yeah yeah yeah i need to learn it you know i like i like how you know you usually there's wine connoisseurs you're saying you're going back to sort of farm to table when you're talking about carrots in that same rigor and nuance you have to consider the different farms involved for the carrots in that same way you have to consider the different salts yeah with like and also not even or kosher salts are the same it's the particular salt that you like get to know it get in a relationship with it mhmm it's like great you will learn so much how they in terms of the the measurement the proportion the the amount you put of salt you put in are you doing that like exactly or are you doing it by feel so it's by feel and that's where you get the relationship so in fact i have a in the in the book in the cookbook i have qr codes that people can scan because when i struggle with recipes is they don't they don't teach you technique right they they you can they can describe the technique but they don't teach the technique because it's it's a technique it's not a recipe and so one of the one of the lessons is how to use salt a steak mhmm and the answer is not here's a teaspoon and you do it this way the answer is use kosher salt so you can see with your eyes because they're little flakes how much salt is on your steak and then taste it and cook it and then taste it and now do you think you need it more or you need it less okay now next time put a little more on because you can see it and it's about learning the the the fact that you you wanted to be able to see how much salt is on the steak so that you can then train yourself for the future how much salt you want your steak yeah but then the steak and the salt kinda dance together it depends on where the steak came from that's true that's true in all the thickness of the steak yeah that'll make a difference but for the most part if you learn if you if you're able to see it versus table salt for example just just disappears you just can't see what you're putting on your steak you can't really learn as a result i think you talk about roast chicken is where your love of food be began well what about steak what's your love of good steak is so great so in in the in the school in the french school you add sauces and all this kind of stuff and in boulder's when you realize like there's a beauty to the to the basic community yeah like a good new york strip from a good rancher that that you know the the there's a lot of discussion controversy on how how cattle should be raised and we have a we have a very different approach which is we know how our cattle are raised we go to the farm we get to know the the rancher we and sometimes you do wanna have them be finished on like they'll be grass fed for the most part but then the then there's some sort of cool recipe of food you're giving them that will then make them taste better and sometimes it it is actually pretty good to have a hundred percent grass fed i've had some amazing ranchers that that show me that the flavor is all there for the average person that you know might go to whole foods or a grocery store i think the simplicity of a of of a good steak it's it it is important to get good sourcing but also it's just it's just it's just good what's your favorite cut of meat is new york strip probably new york strip for me yeah new strip yeah i like the fact that it's lean but if you want the fat you can dive into that little strip of fat or you can leave it alone because you you don't want it that night and it's it's also a great steak for adding something like if you wanna you could either do a cup a pepper sauce or you could do a lot of ground pepper which gives it a peppery mhmm and it's not not sauce but it's a peppery steak it's a really good steak for like a a canvas for for other things but the basic ingredients you're playing with is salt and pepper yeah and it's just the steak actually i will say there's another one garlic mhmm when you when you can one of this is my favorite recipe for for steak is you you season it both sides salt and pepper you saute it in in a little olive oil barely barely anything and you're getting a nice crisp like a golden dark golden brown on both both sides the other the other trick with cooking a steak is don't touch it you need to just put one side when you're ready to turn it turn it around don't touch any other any other time but at the end you take a dab of butter and you crush a a clove of garlic you don't even chop it you just crush the clove and you you put the two of them in the in the pan and you just roll the steak around in the garlic butter i think that's the one bold move kimbo bold move what are you since you're in austin quite a bit opening a restaurant here what do you think about barbecue it's kind of the the texas way well i would say there's an austin way which is which is and and actually even austin would say there's a suburb of austin way like it is i think that actually the the adventure of food is wonderful i would absolutely say that that austin is is one of the great food cities of america and barbecue is one of is one of its gifts that that it gives the city but but you go to one and the other and you'll have a different approach and that that's the part i love is where there's a real celebration of the artisan so you might go to one and they have a they have a style that they love and they've been doing it for years and then you'll go to another and they have a style that they love and they've been doing it for years and it's it's not they're still barbecue but they're actually different and it's really beautiful to see that and that's i think that's what that's what that's what food culture is like it just builds up over time by people who love this style of cooking well i especially love the communal like how they structure restaurants usually or i don't even wanna call it a restaurant because it's a it it doesn't feel like a restaurant it feels like a tavern or some sort like terry black's is like that it's like yeah they also have like paper towels yes yeah as messy as you like yeah and it's a whole roll of paper towel they're gonna just give you a napkin they know what you're getting into yeah and it there's just wood everywhere and it's kinda has this feel like this place has been around forever it's not changing i know it's the twenty first century with the internet and all this kinda yeah nonsense that you people are building but really this is all about the same yes it's been the same for generations we're doing it the same that kind of feel like if you want to escape the world in that way and then truly connect with people one of the other things that'll happen in in a town like austin is there'll be a barbecue joint that is just legendary right and then out of that will come someone who wants to go do their own barbecue joint and they'll take the learning from that barbecue joint they'll open up a new one but it won't be the same as the other barbecue joint part of it says like dude like don't just do the same thing like do do something what what what do you what do you have to say mhmm but also part of it is if you're in the world of food like as an art form and you wanna go open up another barbecue joint you you you kinda wanna prove yourself like i deserve to have a barbecue joint in this town i know this is one of the holy grails of barbecue and and people will follow you like they're following a musician or they're following an artist and they are excited to see what your version is mhmm and how well you can pull it off it's like it's actually but that's what i love that's what i mean by like a a a city with a food culture that austin has that there's also like a legend to certain places certain places are more than just the food they create it's like that could be a burden they have to like live up to the legend legendary nature of the name our restaurant in boulder the kitchen is twenty years old we're very well known we're very well respected and we do have to live up to the name i think that our our restaurant lives up to its name in it in not just the food it's like you walk in and you feel the restaurant and that that is also something we've we've just done naturally the space is a hundred and twenty year old building used to be a brothel it was nice bookstore i mean like like storied history that's interesting this was a literally this was a a mining town right so back in the eighteen hundreds this was built late eighteen hundreds that sort of brussels river that was a thing yeah and so there's an actual tunnel under in the basement that goes to the local hotel that would be used for going back and forth between the hotel and and the rothel without people knowing and the tunnel is now concreted up but you can go about twenty thirty feet into the tunnel but you go into the you go into the space and it's actually an old space so you feel like it's been there forever yeah in twenty ten you had a life threatening accident that changed the way you see life the world also the way you see food and cooking can you tell me the story of it yeah so two thousand ten i was thirty seven i had opened the restaurant in two thousand four and i had loved the restaurant world loved it but it i didn't really wanna grow a restaurant company that wasn't my my goal and so i got went back into technology and i had i had gone from something that i love to something that i like for me it was like it was like chewing sawdust every day i just couldn't believe that i had gone from that had changed my life i had gone back into technology and then now i do do work in technology and i i i do love it but i found a better relationship with it but i was really really unhappy from the outside i was a sort of ceo of a startup but from the inside i was just just very unhappy and i was in jackson hole and i was doing these very aggressive snowboard runs and i'm at the time a pretty pretty good and aggressive snowboarder and i remember saying to myself look i've got kids i need to chill on this i'm next day was valentine's day so next day is tomorrow's valentine's day i'm just gonna have a nice day with the family and and my my wife at the time and we went to a children's run you do the inner tube run and the tubes are small but everyone uses the same tube so i'm six foot five and my kids are four years old and everyone uses the same size tube that should have been a a message to me not not to get on this thing but i went and got on it and the first run and i went down and you're going super fast thirty five miles an hour and the tube hit the braking mats and it stopped it the tube just stopped where where it was it just threw me i was my my head was facing downhill so that's created the wrong center of gravity so instead of breaking it just threw me i landed on my head my head went into my chest like compression into my chest like down like that i ruptured my spine at c six and c seven and in like the blink of a second i was paralyzed i was like like like what you know just like impossible to impossible to comprehend and the they take me put this they put this big thing on my like halo on my head and they take me to the hospital which is more of a medical clinic and i'm just like what is going on here do you remember your thoughts from the moment it happened to like the way to get got to the hospital i remember being so this is one of the things that actually the doctors said caused the most damage was i was thrown from the tube and i and i heard this big crunch sound in my body and i knew that i was hurt but i didn't feel any pain just also that's that's also why why wouldn't you feel pain because i mean you don't have paralyzed you don't feel pain as a i'm and i'm face down on the on the snow and the snow is burning my face because you know you can't you can't do that you need something and i found a way to turn myself around so that my face wouldn't be on the ground but i knew i couldn't move and that they said actually caused more damage than well obviously the accident created the opening but once once you move your body the the blood goes into the spinal column at a faster rate and that that is what caused my paralysis but i remember that and i i remember getting into the into the the the ambulance did you think you were gonna die at that like in those seconds minutes it was a different feeling of death it was it's more it was more of a what is going on here like i just was it was more like i can't make sense of what's going on it was there was there was a moment when i got to the hospital and they they did this mri and the doctor comes up to me and says look we've we've done this mri and so so i'm now now i'm in the hospital and i'm like yeah i can't move but i also don't even feel any pain so i'm like it's very confusing your body looks like you can move it like look see how i'm moving my hand like it looks like you can do that and then it just doesn't move it doesn't there's no there's no there's no feedback loop that it's not moving your brain even thinks it's moving but it's not moving it's like the worst like the most terrifying thing so the doctor says the way the way you broke your neck was really that is zero degree angle that is so rare but as a result there is no twisting of the of the spine we think that we can get the blood out of your of your spinal column and you should get some or maybe all of your movement back and i was like oh okay i think i'm gonna be fine i guess i'm gonna be fine and then i realized i had tears just streaming down the side of my face and i was like woah man i have no idea what's going on so this kind of intense state of confusion i wonder if it's like a weird psychological defense mechanism of like taking you away from the obvious possibility of death yeah it was a for sure all the defense all of the defenses were up i don't know how else to describe it but there was there was denial yeah there was there's a there was this curiosity of like why is there no pain mhmm like that's that when they did actually fit repair me and fix me it was three days later the pain was indescribable how much pain i was in but there was no pain for three days the human body is fascinating then wow so they were able yeah so they did the surgery but i had this i had this very clear voice in my head that kind of determined that it's god i'm not religious but i don't know how else to describe the voice and his voice is very clear you're gonna work with kids and food i'm like okay where did that come from i'm like tech ceo i have a restaurant and then we were working with some kids in schools with like some you know helping a no local nonprofit and i was like no you're just gonna work on kids and food and my good friend antonio and my brother were in the hospital and i was like i'm gonna work on kids and food and you because they're like he's crazy he lost his mind but but not not not not that they would farted them no one is arguing with me but i was like i'm just going to do that i need to say it out loud mhmm and i remember resigning from my to my job as as ceo from the hospital and that was it it was it was just clear it was a clear voice wasn't for a moment wasn't like a flash of light or anything it was probably two weeks of clear voice of clarity clarity exactly clarity no monkey brain nothing no monkey brain just clarity so you're not a religious person but you do call it the voice of god who is that god do you think like who is that that where where did that come from well i've done ayahuasca i've spoken to what they call mother ayah mhmm which is another version of of god it's a it's a divine presence it's maybe i think it's a better way to say it i've also had this debate in my head like maybe it's just me i'm talking to me and it's my my peaceful more kinder more less caught up in the emotion of the day first version of me maybe it's me okay maybe it is but it's there but who are you like how deep does it go what what does you mean you could be you know first of all like the depth of what the human mind even is is a good gigantic mystery consciousness all of it yeah like who are you so like yeah maybe it is you but then maybe in order to build you we need to build the universe yeah and the entire like you are actually a fundamentally a part of this whole human society so the piece the pieces of humans that you've interacted with are all within you and then maybe the history of the humans that came before are also in there and maybe the entirety of life on earth is also in there yeah and whatever the the whatever brought life about on earth is in there somewhere yeah so that's all you yeah all of the the which is really true evolution is it literally is true that that we all are the the photons from the sun came in and we part fish we all came from we all all came from that i think this one you know so one of the one of the things i do is meditate and this was i've been meditating for many many years and what way i meditate is i i sit and i listen to my thoughts and i simply just do that for fifteen to twenty minutes and it just calms the calms the nervous system and i i might i might breathe and just be breathe through because it's been a stressful day and it's just a beautiful way to i kinda do it around i remember i said i used to do a scotch at at the bar after work now i go meditate for instance it's a little less a little bit better for my sure my for my for my health but meditation i was taught was sam harris actually taught me this was not so much just about watching your thoughts mhmm but realizing that you're a watcher you're actually a watcher you're not just like who who is the person watching that that's you actually your thoughts are are floating through your mind but you are the watcher and i was like oh that's really interesting okay so i'm gonna learn that i'm gonna i'm gonna be the watcher and what i learned was i'm watching these thoughts go by and there's a consistent other presence and i'm like what is that consistent other presence it's not a thought that is not a it's not a not something i can kind of let it float away and it doesn't even wanna float away it isn't it's just it's just a consistent other presence that i can watch and feel so you you are the watcher watching the feelings and thoughts but there's also an other presence next to you almost yes yeah that's how i feel and it's a beautiful presence it's not not a presence that is trying to intervene it's not a presence that is trying to tell you what to do it's just a beautiful presence and that might be the the the thing part of the thing you met when you took ayahuasca i learned about mother iow where you have this experience of talking to actually i would say the closest thing to breaking my neck but i had that feeling was ayahuasca can you go through that experience because i'm actually traveling to the amazon jungle in a in a month i'll probably do ayahuasca for the first time okay so i need a preview unofficial instruction manual yeah sure so first of all i think many many different ways to do it right so and i have done i've done many many different ways there's a very western medicine approach where you have doctors that look after you during the day you know put an eye mask on you're on on a futon and you're you're really are in a western medicine setting and it's frankly for me has been the most powerful experience i feel the most comfortable because i'm part of western medicine in my upbringing the other extreme but they're kind of in between would be very probably a peruvian ceremonies where you're probably where you're gonna go very much about you do it in a community you do it with others and you you feel people go through their pain and their processing so i i know i know the whole gamut but the the thing that the thing that i found most powerful about it and profoundly powerful i would say for first of all it's nonrecreational so no don't no one should do this for a good time this is not a good time this is this is a very almost traumatic but in again a beautiful way actually gonna say that way but it's not it's not traumatic it's profound so it's it's more like you don't have you you you you you really leave who you were before behind and then you become the person you will be afterwards and that that's never an easy thing thing yes exactly and sometimes what what i recall is was arguing with balaraya and saying no i'm i'm fine like what what what you're talking about like leave me alone and yeah it did that how did that work out but before twenty ten the accident and the the the two transformational experiences you had you were a very successful tech ceo maybe go back to the early days with zip two in nineteen ninety four you and elon started zip two tell me the story of that yeah so ninety four we actually did a road trip around the us to brainstorm about what what we wanted to do after college what was the road trip like what is it like so we went from silicon valley to to philadelphia nice my brother's old like a really really cool you know it's one of those very old bmws not not not ones from the sixties or seventies but it wouldn't but but the car didn't work it would break down all the time but we had we had a blast you know we just i remember going through needles on the border of california arizona it's a town called needles it's the hottest place in america mhmm and the engine quit was not cooling so we had to put the heat on so we've got the heat blasting to cool the engine keep the engine cool and we keep the windows down because that way we can't stand the heat in the car but actually the outside heat is hotter than the inside heat so you're you're just you're just in an in a furnace yeah you're driving through it's so light even i can't imagine doing that oh wow in the day yeah it was a it was a it was a wonderful would took us a few weeks i think three weeks maybe first time across america first like a road trip like that yeah for sure but it was really not a road trip for tourist sites we we went to the weirdest places and we're actually i would say we didn't we didn't go to them we broke down in the weirdest places because that's what that's when we stopped yeah do you meet any interesting people i remember we broke down in the badlands of south dakota mhmm about an hour from rapid city and there's that road is empty and so we actually slept in in the car because there was a phone there was just no one around there was no cell phones in those days and eventually a trucker picked us up i was just like man you you guys are the dumbest kids on the planet he was like twenty one he was maybe twenty two and but but he was so he was so nice to us and so kind to us and found us a mechanic in rapid city and and then found us a tow truck and yeah you find you find the most wonderful people when when you're when you're in a place of distress people people do wanna take care of other people they help you yeah they wanna help and especially when you're on a road trip i i've because i i've taken a road trip across the united states and there's a part of people where they they really love that they i think part of them wants to do that also wants to kind of escape whatever the local the struggles just whatever the mundaneness the struggle of life are yeah a road trip is a kind of thing where you're like you know what i'm going to get away from it all and i'm going to experience life in the full the epic sort of jack kerouac way of seeing america the people not the tourist sites just the human beings we this was not tourist related we did of course when we stopped at mount rushmore at night which you can see nothing yeah yeah we we thought that was hilarious you you you couldn't see mount rushmore that's great it was like well we we we physically were here with a photo of us not seeing the pictures you could just say you went to the grand canyon too just at night and just visit different places when the car broke down i love it so yes you took the road trip before finding zip two yeah so so i had a experience in college running a house painting business that for me was my first experience with success it was very very hard it was a franchise where you where they teach you you know students how to paint houses and and but i i was good at it you know i i built a team of thirty people within after about two years and so i was like i i had a taste of hey i'm not i'm not unable to do this i mean in fact my my most vulnerable place i remember as an entrepreneur was i i had i had i just loved the idea of wall street and finance i was kind of allured by it this is in late eighties i'm in high school and there was a lot of these books liar's poker and others that came out i was like oh man this this is awesome these people must be amazing so i went to business school and i i busted my ass to get like a kick ass summer job and i got a job in one of the main banks and it was in toronto but it was like the original wall street and i was i was so disappointed with the people that i was around i was just like woah i totally misunderstood what what the banking world is it was very large bank i'm sure if i'd gone to a more aggressive one maybe i would have had a better experience when i say aggressive meaning someone was paying attention like this was just just people kinda showing up and not doing much you know and and yeah actually this is funny so this is great so the so nineteen ninety one ninety two so this one of those summers the the the summer job was literally you go to the the they print out the sales for all for all brokerage houses for the whole company like pile of papers that's maybe four or five feet tall and you have a pencil and you add things up using your pencil and a calculator and i had known about lotus one two three forever mhmm excel was coming out and i was like hey guys you know that there's a different way to do this and they're like don't talk to us just just just a job yeah go do it just use the pencil so i i went to the head of the data i just asked because you know those those days you had the manila envelope where you can you you just write the name of the person that you want this to go to and it'll go to them them mhmm it's like email i guess but you you you there's no yeah there's no filter so if you i i there's no spam filter there's no spam filter so i sent a note i wrote a nice letter to the to the database administrator who i didn't really know and i said would you be open to me saying hi and maybe i can get access to the file rather than print the damn thing out and use a pencil and she could respond right away and we hit it off i mean she was great and so she's like of course you can hit it i can't believe these guys are doing what they're doing so and for the first couple of weeks so for that was a summer i i wrote it i wrote code in lotus one two three that would you it's gonna sound crazy but you type in the date range you type in the geography and you type in the you know which part of bank you care about and it will literally just create a a new spreadsheet and it will just the macro would print it out it was like a magic trick for these guys and incredible i know no it's like it's a sounding that that's i mean for me i'm like guys this is so obvious and so i did i got all that done and and this job was supposed to take three or four months because it's really you're doing this with a pencil and now i'd created this macro that you could not just not just do it you could do it you could tweak it and say oh i want this this area of the world or this area of or this this month or you know that month compared to that month you know all the normal things you could do with a spreadsheet and the software was on a floppy disk i was like here's the software and just put it put it into your computer alright now now low open one two three and and it just pops up with a little box of type in your dates and you know the whole little i coded a little thing like that and what i what i was astounded by was not not so much that it was a magic trick it was the lack of appreciation for innovation they just looked at it and they were like that's nice and i was like you just we're gonna have someone spend hundreds of hours doing something and now it's something you can do in a minute yeah if that doesn't if that doesn't move your assignment yeah like if that doesn't move your needle what the heck and so i was really disappointed with with the banking world anyway so that that was but that was also fine i think good example though yeah and then also see the possibility of where that goes but then so then i i i got back to business school and i i canceled all of my business classes like possibly could but i was actually in business school so i couldn't cancel them all all finance courses i was like i'm i'm done with that industry i'm not going back so the the vulnerable part for me was my whole family is full of entrepreneurs and there was there was this franchise to do house painting and i genuinely was afraid that i wouldn't be good at it and i was like wow i really am afraid of failure it's very easy to avoid entrepreneurship but if your whole family is entrepreneurs you and you go in and you aren't good i i was really afraid you're gonna have to face that failure every time you meet your family yes and it's it's our yeah our family are wonderful and everything but they but pretty much everyone's an entrepreneur and and of of course not everyone is perfect not everyone's you know doing it successfully all the time but when you're when you're young and you wanna prove yourself it really was putting my heart on my sleeve i i started the the the business in this part of toronto and for the first so you you paint the houses in the summer but you do all your sales pre before the summer and you know all the way till april i was just not succeeding and i was like oh i'm like oh my god i'm just i'm just gonna fail and i i remember that i was like my my whole nervous system was like i'm a failure and i remember i had this general manager who who you know he was like look it's like kim well you seem like you know what you're doing why are you not making any sales and so so he actually went with me on a few sales calls and i was like and i said oh you're he he was great you're doing this wrong you're doing that wrong you're doing this wrong and changed those three things and it was like a like a like a watershed moment just like all of a sudden and i and i just followed the instructions of what this guy told me all of a sudden every single sale i would make well i was like i can't believe that i i it was really my my lack of humility mhmm to learn from someone else i was like no i'm gonna prove that i can do this without your teachings and i i was gonna fail so to you that humility is essential for the entrepreneur especially young i would say if we if we have an openness to learning which does require humility you you you course correct you help get other people to help you course correct but it it does start with humility because if you if you try and pretend you have all the answers you don't so you went from that to founding zip two that was an interesting time in the history of tech yeah what i mean what was it like you you mentioned the first people to look at a map basically directions yeah so mapping had been on the internet but vector based mapping had not so that's the ability to zoom in or zoom out and it's really data versus an image that comes across and we we can't we went to this company called navtech my brother and i and we just just asked for the data and they it's a silicon valley they wrote us a one page letter that we had to sign and said here's all of our data that we own it you don't own it but you can use it on the internet and if you ever make any money on it you have to call us mhmm that was it yeah we're like okay that sounds great so we put it up on the internet and back in those days it might take sixty to a hundred and twenty seconds to actually give you an answer back but it was amazing the door to door directions the ability to to take a map and zoom in and zoom out we use these things ten times a day now it was amazing we were the first two humans to see it on the internet like this stuff didn't even exist to the world like the navtech was building it for never love for herz never love which would come out a few years later this was not something that people knew existed this was something we discovered that it existed everyone like well let's put it on the internet and share it with the world what did the two of you feel like they're like you see that magic did you know amazing it was like what like did you i mean the amazing just that it's cool but also that you could see the future that this could transform i don't think i don't think people understand before this moment you could not be told your directions yeah you just could not like today we live in this world where we're told our directions all the time yeah before this moment you could not be told your directions yeah and all of a sudden you could yeah it wasn't like a little thing yeah there's a there's a bunch of things that we once we have we take it for granted and that takes like a day for people to like transition totally one it's like boom oh okay cool exactly exactly and it's when you see maybe when you're one of the first humans to see that thing you're like holy shit holy shit this is going to be used by everyone all the time forever so zip two was a success i would say it was a success but it was also a very hard company to build and i mean it because the internet in those days was a boom time we were being funded but we couldn't make any money mhmm and so it was actually really hard the constant outside criticism that we aren't for real this is not gonna survive this is not gonna and it it started to feel that way we're like wow man this is this is we are doing something that is great that people are using i mean we were top one hundred website most of our work was through folks like the new york times so we are even bus even much much busier than that but the but the there was just no money in it mhmm and even today go to google maps there's there's no money in it it's just it's just local search that that is needed for everyone mhmm and it became an add on to search but even remember in those days you couldn't make money at search either mhmm no one had figured out adwords or anything didn't realize how big of a business this was but we all knew this was a thing mhmm and everyone was using it but didn't quite know how to make money on it didn't make money when we got acquired it was a bittersweet moment because compaq had owned ultavista wanted to merge so that's sort of regular search with with the best search engine at the time pre google with zip two which would be the best local search and it would be a yahoo killer and the the compact just wanted to make money by taking the company public but they wouldn't give us any stock they would just they paid us cash turned out actually very well for us but because the whole internet bubble burst we we didn't know that at the time and so it was bittersweet because they they essentially wanted our company with and we were welcome to stay mhmm but but you don't have to right and that feeling was pretty that was a pretty rough feeling but in retrospect it opened the door to it set us set us up for an incredible platform to go do beautiful things you invested in x dot com that eventually merged with paypal that's a fascinating story there also fascinating on many levels including the fact that the the current social media company formerly known as twitter is now called x there's a history has like a has a rhyme to it like it's kind of all hilarious in a certain kind of way you invested in and helped sell a lot of the initial products for tesla yeah i i still sell on the board of tesla tesla is twenty years now isn't that amazing twenty years yeah from the roadster the initial roadster to i still have the the first business plan so i didn't join as a founder i joined as a as a founding board member and so i actually i didn't write the business plan i i got to read it and i still have that i still have it as a part of history did you see the future at that time like the company that tesla is today could you possibly could you and elon imagine it no no i i i certainly didn't what i what i saw in it was a a real for me personally i was really upset that the general motors had killed the their ev car there's even a movie called how we kill the electric car and i and i knew that the the physics of of of electric is perfectly fine i mean there's no reason why you couldn't use an electric car to drive around what what i what resonated with me with the with the business plan was take an electric motor which is really a high performance motor and put it in a sports car and sell it at a high price as a way to enter into the market whereas what what others had been doing has what these general motors had done is you put it into a really crummy car and you you sell it as a commuter vehicle that doesn't really work that well and it looks ugly as well like they really did everything they could to make that thing as ugly as sin and and then i was like okay i get it we're we're gonna take a an appropriate technology and put it in an appropriate car so that when you have because electric motors are they have constant torque you get incredible power put it in a car that that looks like a sports car you know so we so so the the the idea was to put it in the lotus elise redesign it a bit and i even at that point i was like this is theoretically good so i'm gonna join and help build it but i was not convinced that it would work because because general motors had done such a terrible job of making everyone think that these things are terrible but but i was curious and the time that i fell in love with the company and and its mission was i was driving in in a in a what's called a mule where we we take a a car and we take the engine out and we put put in a electric drivetrain and i drove it you know even the dashboards there's no dashboards it's just like you got you got a steering wheel and it's just like wires and everything around and i remember there's a street we were running the bay area called bing street and i was just like no no no no traffic so i'm just gonna drive this on the floor and see what happens and it was it was a feeling i'd never experienced before so it's not gasoline cars have an inertia to them mhmm so you go yeah this is just was like being shot out of a cannon mhmm and i okay this is gonna be real it's a very spaceship like feeling yeah it's like woah it's like the g the g the g force pulls you back yeah so so i was like okay this is this is gonna be great this is gonna be this is gonna be an interesting we're gonna create something interesting here i think the real transformative thing for tesla was the the model three when we were able to get the price down for the world and that and that was also one of the most challenging periods for tesla and you were doctor we were borderline bankrupt like two or three times that year i mean it was just every and everyone was hating on us about whether we'd get that done the model three today is incredibly affordable car like a three hundred bucks a month kinda lease and three thousand dollars down that's where you get the scale that's where you get people who and by the way it's a great car it's even a better model three now than it was five years ago we we don't function the way car companies function right we we function more like how an iphone company how apple works so our model three today is it's this year is better than last year it's like way better and it's like this and we just keep getting better yeah and the software is a fundamental part of the car and the software keeps improving exactly and we can't we can upload over the air which was one of the things that people don't often acknowledge it's the over the air updates yes it's like a revolutionary thing yes it's not just the autopilot to me it's like the over the air updates is even bigger thing than autopilot yeah at least in this like moment of history because you you basically turned a car into the iphone exactly it's an iphone with wheels but actually talking about autopilot like right after this interview i'm gonna go test out the latest model three you're gonna get driven around by the robot i'm gonna get driven around by the car i'm gonna say i wanna go to this barbecue joint mhmm take me there and park me there and i'm gonna see how it is and this is our the the latest model three that we have out since production anyone can buy it and it's super affordable and it's like okay it's not you know full self driving is is a is a journey right it's it's it's not like there's a destination it's a journey forever so let's see where we are on the journey today and there's been a bit of a push and pull between you and elon in terms of levels of optimism about deadlines and so on timelines about when we'll arrive at the destination i like that you said it's a journey yeah for elon there's a destination exactly and that destination is tomorrow yeah right or yesterday i think that's a that's a that's a really good insight i i actually live with this concept of a growth mindset versus a fixed mindset and and it's a i don't know philosophical term where where fixed mindset is about the destination and growth mindset is about learning on the journey and i think that i'm a happier person because i take that learning on the journey approach which is really frustrating if you're always it has to be about the destination every time the nice thing about destination at least from my personal perspective as like a programmer engineer is like it's it puts a little fire under you to get shit done like if there's a clear deadline of a destination you feel the inside of that i i would say that i still do that but i call those forcing functions yeah instead of destinations sure because you're just forcing people to crank on on some code or cookbook or whatever because you have a date and and if you're you're really and oftentimes there's reason i mean this twentieth anniversary you wanna get the cookbook out we have a reason it's we didn't make this up out of thin air and so you yeah that does push you but just because we have the cookbook doesn't mean it's a destination mhmm it means it was a forcing function to get it out there now we're on the journey speaking of journeys i have to ask you about spacex i mean the journey that all of humanity saw seriously that is a book about it and a journey that is incredible it's an interesting moment in the history of humanity mhmm that perhaps hopefully will become a multi planetary species but spacex is also a company you invested in spacex you were side by side with elon through through through the highs and the lows through the lows and the highs so what were some memorable challenges what were some low points sure i i think from the history of spacex one of the hardest times in spacex was we were in the mid pacific in kwazalein and my brother had had sold paypal he'd done well financially but in the rocket world that money goes away really quickly and we're in this military base in kwajalein and i think it was the second rocket that blew up i'm not sure but we didn't have infinite resources i certainly didn't have the resources i mean i i'm there to support brotherly support but the the so so every every rocket launch was do or die and the first one had blown up and so the second one i think it was the second one blew up and it was it was so depressing it was just like and there's nowhere to go you're in the there's no there's no distraction you're just you're on this military race you don't resocialize so it's just we were all together and i had i'd gotten to know you know for me i'm i'm not part of the team right i'm just there for emotional support or whatever because it's cool and so i got to know this a couple of people locally and i got to know this one guy who who had a mobile home best view in the world but it's just a mobile home next with a good patch of grass next to it and i was just desperate to find food that wasn't from the cafeteria because is the worst food you can imagine yeah and and so he showed i i met him and he showed me this little tiny little grocery store which had a few things like canned tomatoes and not this is again in the middle of nowhere so it's nothing fresh and i made this dish that was you know kind of a version of a like an italian version of chili you know just baked beans and to sweating onions and and then tomatoes and it was a big pot of food because it's a group of people we didn't even have a table and we just put the big pot in the middle and we had our little paper plates and took a scoop as we needed it and it was do we need the gathering place of like food brings people together in the most difficult times and it was one of my favorite memories because i was able to bring my gift to this group of incredible people that their hearts were broken you know and to sit there and share a meal and feel the life kinda come back into us and by the end of the night we're actually having a good time what a fascinating contrast of rockets kinda representing the peak accomplishment of human beings as a society and then returning to the thing that is the foundation of human society which is that communal experience communal vulnerable connection like we mentioned vulnerability earlier the most vulnerable place actually that's when you have some of your most beautiful meals yeah the descendants of apes gathering around some baked beans right after watching a rocket explode yeah what gives you hope about this the future of this whole thing we got going on humanity if you look at how things have changed over the past say fifty years you can clearly say oh wow poverty rates have gone down infant mortality has gone down dramatically all these things have gone down a lot so so if you if you if you look at it on a daily basis you can tell that life is very dramatic you know whether it's some some something's blowing up on x or from the newspapers or whatever and you can really get caught up into it but if you look back over over the past few decades things things are getting better and it's and and i mean at the fundamental level like are less people hungry are more people they are more is there are there i mean there is war going on of course but are there less wars yes mhmm and so i think that i think if if we all just step back a little bit it's it's less about hope it's more of perspective and reflection and and if if if i if i do see a problem like in case of the obesity epidemic i work really hard to help with that i've worked with our nonprofit's called big green and we we work with a hundred and fifty nonprofits around the country to help americans grow food again get connected to their food because i really believe growing food changes your life and so okay let's let's go do that so then so i'll see you know i'll help out where i think we really do can make a difference but but if you step back a little things are are actually getting better yeah it's just a bumpy ride yeah and for those of us watching all of this i think i would love to see more celebrating of the people that are helping the people that have found their way of helping and just celebrating those people well i would also actually it's a really nice point i have learned that you really wanna celebrate your successes mhmm because even in the greater scheme of things i've learned this in the startup world where you you're constantly facing death you know like you're just why should you even exist do your customers want your product or whatever and and then something will happen where you're like wow we we really nailed that that's really great or you know got a product released or got some good kudos from something alright everyone we're gonna go celebrate and and actually everyone's still like no no we got all these other problems nope we're gonna go celebrate and then we'll go back to the problems but if you don't do that then it starts building on this kind of you never really get to celebrate mhmm and be grateful well i think this is a good time to go celebrate the very fact that we're alive today we get to live and enjoy this incredible life the two of us and have this great conversation and we'll get to celebrate over some scrambled eggs beautiful i'm gonna hold you to it beautiful kimbal thank you so much for talking today thank you for having me thanks for listening to this conversation with kimbal musk to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you some words from anthony bourdain your body is not a temple it's an amusement park enjoy the ride thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
