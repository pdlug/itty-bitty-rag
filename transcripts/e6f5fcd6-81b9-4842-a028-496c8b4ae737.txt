really good when you do fasting whether that's for twenty four hours for seventy two hours for anything i mean i guess you could fast without any of that but that's going to be not a fun time when you do low carb diets like i do or ultra low carb or just carnivore also getting you electrolytes is really important also if you do any kind of long distance cardio so long distance running for example for me getting your electrolyzed is really really important it's it's kinda crazy how big of a difference it can make when you get the sodium and the potassium and the magnesium right and element is just a delicious way to get those right my favorite flavor is watermelon salt that's what i'm drinking right now that's what i've always been drinking when i on the podcast usually you see me with

the first draft of a thing you're writing you can also ask it a bunch of stuff about project by collaboration i know people that use it for that i think that's probably a really amazing thing to use it for i currently just do wolf pack of one solo i need to probably start to use it in collaboration with the team it's amazing for that i just haven't taken the leap yet but as a note taking thing and actually collaboration on a sort of a two person thing which i haven't used it for is really really amazing i highly recommend it play around with it see what you think especially their ai thing

spoon in the result is just delicious and refreshing i i like it cold i'll sometimes put it in the freezer to where it like freezes just a tiny bit so it's like a little bit of a slushy consistency if i want a kind of slushy experience which i'm a big fan of the seven eleven slopey slushy all of that kind of stuff is just incredible and whenever i run into one that has sugar free which does happen they usually run out of it it just makes me so happy just sitting there with a slusher or slurpee i forget which one it is which one is the seven eleven one i don't know i could look it up but i'm not going to slurpee slushy same thing i just love it makes me happy so i i go to that place of happiness with a delicious thing of a g one you should consider trying to do the same kind of slushy

is also brought to you by insidetracker a service i use to track the data that comes from my body biological data it's in the blood it's dna data it's fitness tracker data all of that shoved into a machine learning algorithm that tells me what i should do with my life in terms of like lifestyle changes and diet hopefully this is the future where there's more and more data that could be used from the human body to make suggestions about what you should do with your life obviously for me i wanted to be a psychiatrist for a long time i'm fascinated with the human mind and to be able to collect data from the human mind high resolution data such that you don't need to make sense of the data you can just shove it into a very large neural network and it gives you recommendations that's such an interesting possibility there's been recent breakthroughs on the neuralink and the bci fronts it's really really exciting what you could do with that data and that you could do it in a safe way for humans just love it so the more data that comes from the body from the human mind from the brain i'm really excited by the possibilities of that of course it has to be done safely in a way that respects the individual rights all that kind of stuff very important but also the possibilities for human health for human flourishing is just really exciting to me anyway you can get special savings

do you remember when you saw your first fight i think so i remember being at my grandmother's house and i think it was an ali fight and all my uncles were going crazy during the fight and there was just this buzz and this energy in the house that i liked at at a very young age and i'm pretty sure that was my first fight ali was something special yeah incredible i mean when when you look around not just here in the office but at my house ali and tyson are everywhere would you put ali as the greatest of all time boxing well i would put ali as the greatest of all time human being i mean when you it's it's it's easy as a fight fan to focus on him as a fighter but when you focus on him as a human and you think about what he meant at that time and place the things he said the poems he came up with you know the just just the overall brilliance of muhammad ali the guts the guts to have the strength mentally physically and emotionally to go against the grain at the time that he did it it was a very dangerous time for him to be who he was yet because of how smart he was and because of his personality and how if you sat down with him you could you could be the the biggest racist on the planet it's hard to get in a room with ali and not like ali yeah he's all love yeah humor all of it hundred percent and had the guts in the ring and the guts to take a stand hundred percent when it was hard he might be one of the all time greatest humans you know what i mean just an impactful powerful human being who happened to be a great boxer and sometimes the right moment meets the the great human being that's important i agree with you and and he was the right guy in the right place at the right time and he's also a guy who used his platform for all the right things so that might have been your first fight but when did you fall in love with fighting the art of it the science of it yeah i i would say i really fell in love with it so i i i was a senior it was nineteen eighty seven and hagler leonard happened yeah and i watched that fight and i taped it and i watched that fight like a million times i was a huge huge hagler fan and i like sugar ray leonard too but i was a huge hagler fan and you know i just remember i watched that fight a million times because i i i was i was pissed off and i felt like hagler got robbed in the fight you know what i mean but it it it that was really what made me start to love the sport of boxing the battle of it like yeah i was seventeen and then after that usa's tuesday night fights mhmm came out on television it was on every tuesday night religiously never missed tuesday night fights i was there watched all those fights and you know a lot of a lot of the the things you see in the ufc not not necessarily just the production but i would say the the feel and the style and all those things are are all things that i things that i loved about boxing and things that i hated about boxing right down to the commentary you loved and hated hated the yeah hated the commentary certain things that i loved about boxing i incorporated into the ufc things that i hated about boxing i made sure that the ufc stayed far away from i think i can't stand larry merchant can't stand larry merchant and i used to watch hbo boxing and mute the commentary so that i didn't have to listen to them lampley too you know you you would you would spend this money for the pay per view to watch these people that you idolized to hear these idiots rip them apart while the fight was happening you know oh they were criticizing them for hundred percent ripping them apart i've gotten used to the ufc so i don't i'm trying to remember looking back it was bad it was bad it was really bad but the the the sweet science the art of boxing was beautiful still like the story is still i wanna do this with you right now hey we we we bring your cell phone over here and and and pull up youtube i wanna do this for you so that you you can understand this and understand where i was coming from for the commentary at yeah at this point in time i have all good memories you're gonna ruin it for me yeah no there are nothing but great memories about boxing but the presentation and and and a lot of things but it but it's how fucking weird is it that i even cared about this shit at that point in my life and that time in my life i like what impact could i possibly have on it so think about tyson and how much everybody loved tyson at the time and wanna listen to this listen to this entrance of the former undisputed heavyweight champion and here he comes mike tyson as he heads toward the same ring he made his disgraceful exit in june of ninety seven wow the crowd one of the baddest motherfucking walk ins of all time by the way right yeah so what this guy should be doing and this is one of the albert brothers yeah shut the fuck up yeah stay out of the way yeah maybe build them up or that or don't say anything just let the fans i'm explaining that's why we watch yeah yeah yeah you know what i mean that's why we paid our money center you don't need to say anything scary imposing music will he be able to intimidate his opponent tonight will it even matter i really thought there'd be more of an explosion by the crowd here but very mixed even with the win tonight no matter how one-sided he will still have his detractors following the two fights to with holyfield his stocks plummeted the pundits came down hard feeling they were too and his knockouts were over second rate fighters now the crowd erupts more as he gets into the ring yeah but it's certainly nothing overwhelming what a dick you're right i don't remember that you're right imagine you're right you you you you you paid your money yeah to watch mike tyson and you gotta listen to these fucking jerk offs talk shit about them the whole way to the right first of all one of the coolest walk ins ever you know it's the first time anybody had heard dmx right yeah yeah that's right you know he's walking into some scary imposing music will it even matter what you know it's just all that kind of stuff i i i do literally used to analyze every ounce of the production that would happen on television and at a time when i didn't even know why i was doing it but but it's in there somewhere like you were thinking about it right so yeah i hated hbo commentary i thought you know at the time hbo boxing was obviously the gold standard for for you know but when you really think about boxing at that time their production the only thing that changed over thirty years was like hd i mean even the commentators were the same for for thirty years and then you had the time when larry merchant gets up and and literally starts fighting with floyd mayweather during the interview and says if i was thirty years younger i'd kick your ass right now oh yeah i remember that yeah yeah i mean these are the interviews that we have to listen to when we're trying to watch a boxing match the level of boxing was good think about a fighter right fighter has been gone for months away from their families and yeah away from everything training cutting weight sparring then they go in and they have to fight that night and then you have to you know if you watch your fight back you gotta listen to this bullshit from these guys and then and then you get interviewed and and your interview is is this it's just and it's not just about the pay per view money it's about like these are legends of humanity like we should celebrate the highest form of like accomplishment hundred percent these aren't like mike tyson so you know who goes in there and and interviews fighters joe rogan right yeah who who has trained and and and and and done everything and has the utmost respect for the sport and the athletes or you you you got like daniel cormier who was a former world champion himself and has actually been through it done it knows and those are the type of people that we put in the booth people that are actually experienced in it yeah not not not not these people who've never been in a fight in their fucking life right yeah but they're also both dc and rogan are like big kids they love it a hundred percent they love it well everybody does i mean if you look at it's it's the difference between our commentary and what i feel their commentary was we don't hire paid talking heads we hire people that have actually been in it done it love it and are are are super super passionate about the sport yeah and and i would say that none of them that ever covered the sport back then were the the i don't know if that was marv albert or what albert brother that was but he sound like he's a fan of the sport or anyway you got me you you got me on this and it looks like it on did i lose my mind maybe we wouldn't have a ufc if if they didn't fuck it up so bad and for the tyson it would be different you're not wrong you're not wrong it would be different there's no doubt about it all those experiences growing up being a boxing fan helped create what the ufc is today you know it's interesting because humans have been fighting for millennia and it seems like with the ufc the rate of innovation is just insane in these last three decades it seems like we've discovered how to do unarmed combat faster and better than than at any time in human history i agree with you a hundred percent the first ufc happened in nineteen ninety three right martial art versus martial art yeah and now over the last thirty years martial arts has evolved faster than you know what i mean and and and like you just said combat sports fighting whatever you wanna call it martial arts it has evolved so much in thirty years more than the last three hundred years what did you think when you saw ufc one with royce i remember everybody talking that this fight was gonna happen and there was gonna be no rules and all this other stuff and we're like there's no way that's bullshit and then we ended up at some guy's house that night in boston and and watching it and it was happening and it was fun and it was exciting and everything else and then and then i sort of fell off after that the first one i i i watched but i i was too big of a boxing fan plus once grappling started taking over and you know by grappling meaning the wrestling and the and and the jujitsu guys had just laid there you know i i completely lost interest it's funny that that i'm having this conversation with you right now because last night i was out last night with my friends and we were talking about because one one of my buddies who's a host here in town mhmm just did jujitsu for the first time nice yesterday yeah and he was like did he get his ass kicked yeah yeah but when you first go in yeah our first jujitsu lesson me lorenzo and frank was with john lewis nice and i remember thinking holy shit i i i can't believe that i'm you know twenty eight years old and this is the first time i'm experiencing this that that another human being could do this to me yeah on the ground it is such an eye opening mind blowing experience when you do it for the first time and then you become completely addicted to it and you know we were training three four days a week trying to kill each other and and me and the fertitas and that's how we fell in love with the sport i think that first time that you do jujitsu it's like the red pill and the blue pill in the matrix do you wanna believe that this is the world that you live in or do you wanna see what the real world looks like it's just as a real red pill it really is you realize holy shit it really is shit talking i've been doing about me being a badass you realize you're not you get dominated by another human being you realize no and i mean dominate i mean completely treat you like you're a little kid yeah and then we had the opportunity to roll with a lot of different guys at the time because of the whatever and and we don't have a good relationship at all but i'll tell you this frank shamrock came in one day and frank shamrock had me in side control mhmm the pressure that this guy put on my chest made me tap yeah felt like i there was a car on my chest and with zero effort from him it was absolutely effortless and when when you when you train with somebody that's at such a level when you're not mhmm it it just it is the most humbling mind blowing experience you can have as especially as a man but as a human being do you remember just for fun do you remember like what your go to submission was yeah so you know when we first started out and started doing it i had a pretty good guillotine in the beginning so i'd catch a lot of people in guillotines and so you're okay being on like on bottom so like you started with the good bottom yeah i was okay with being on bottom i was comfortable there but you know what i never liked i never liked ghee like we started fucking around with the ghee in the beginning we would you know that's how we started and then once i took the ghee off i felt like i had no submissions because i couldn't grab on to anything so i after that i went all no gi and i i i never wanted to wear a gi and it's fascinating because no gi has become big now and there's a lot of interesting people i got training with gordon ryan and like the level there is just fascinating it's become like the science and it looks like fighting now it looks more like fighting as opposed to with the gi sometimes it doesn't quite look like fighting right and i feel like it's transferable to actual like mma fighting no gi stuff or street street yeah right i mean if you're if if you start off in your first year you're in a gi and man you better hope guys got like winter jackets on or something if something happens in the street because it it in my opinion i know that you just fucking people are gonna go crazy over this but in my opinion no gi is way better than gi that said i also do judo so in the street scenario if you're comfortable on the feet and you can clinch and you can throw you could because most of us wear clothing especially in boston and new york city exactly so if you're comfortable on the feet you could still do well there the problem with jiu jitsu is most people are not comfortable on the feet the sport jiu jitsu most people kinda wanna get to the ground as quickly as possible so what'd you think of hoist at that time like in the early like what because it blew a lot of people's minds that there's like more to this puzzle hundred percent and the fact that you had like these guys like ken shamrock that were jacked yeah right and you had all these wrestlers or you know the big massive guys that they had in the different weight classes and this skinny little dude like hoist was out there beating everybody i mean if you look at the way the the gracies played that you couldn't have a better advertisement for for gracie jiu jitsu at the time but also like for mma because there's just a lot of surprising elements a lot of people's prediction was wrong right they didn't think the skinny guy would win and they're like oh shit there's more to this what's the real beautiful thing about jiu jitsu it's like when you talk about if you wanted to get your daughter into a martial art should i put my daughter into karate or should i put her into this you put your daughter into jujitsu a hundred percent because it's not about size or strength it's about technique mhmm and you give your daughter a bunch of jiu jitsu and a little bit of muay thai you know yeah she becomes dangerous it's like the perfect combo yeah because you can put your son into anything your son can get in some you know boys are gonna learn how to fight and they're gonna do whatever but girls are girls are different and the other thing i mean this is the biggest selling point for jiu jitsu for women i mean when a woman no matter how big how small can put a guy to sleep in three and a half seconds what's the origin story of the ufc as it is today as you have created it and you and lorenzo and fertitta brothers built it it started with with john lewis you know and and and seeing him frank and i were out one night at the hard rock mhmm and john lewis was there and he's like oh that's that ultimate fighting guy and i was like i know him and frank's like i've always wanted to learn ground fighting and i said yeah i'm interested in it too so we went over we talked to john lewis and we made an appointment to wrestle with him on monday yeah and we told lorenzo and lorenzo came with us and that was the beginning of the end i mean we we started doing jujitsu and and started to meet a lot of the fighters and we were like you know at the time there was a stigma attached to the sport that these guys were you know despicable disgusting human beings but which was the furthest thing from the truth these these kids had all gone to college had college degrees most of them because they wrestled in college and we started to meet some of we love the different stories you had chuck liddell who you know had this mohawk looks like an axe murderer and but graduated from cal poly you know with honors in accounting you know yeah then you had matt hughes who was this farm boy you know literally lived on a farm and so there were all these cool stories yeah with all these good people that weren't what people thought they were and lorenzo and i always felt like there's something here that that if this thing was done the right way this could be big and what was crazy was i i was in a contract negotiation with bob meyerowitz the old owner of the ufc over tito's contract and chuck liddell they didn't even want chuck liddell in the ufc wow i was trying to get chuck in the ufc and they didn't even want him wow and we got into this contract dispute over tito's contract and bob myers said you know what there is no more money okay i i don't even know if i'll even be able to put on one more event and he like flipped out we hung up the phone i literally picked up the phone and called the runs and i said hey i just got off the phone with bob myers the owner of the ufc i think they're in trouble and i think we could buy it and i think we should you should reach out to him so lorenzo lorenzo called meyerowitz and i don't know how i don't remember the timeline but within the next two months we ended up owning the ufc for two million bucks and you've said that you fought a lot of battles during that time oh i mean the early days of of building this company and building the sport it was the wild wild west man it was it was crazy back then yeah i i was literally at war every day with all different types of people plus traditionally there's bad people that are involved in in fighting man there's lots of bad people and we had to sift our way through that for the first seven eight years so in general there's like corruption that people kinda steal money they're thinking just about themselves not the bigger business let me tell you about this i mean i i i wanna say it was the netherlands i don't remember exactly where it could've been amsterdam i mean mma promoters were like car bombing each other and then the other guy shot up the other guy's house with machine guns and that's the kind of shit that was going on yeah i'll tell you the story so affliction do you remember affliction yeah uh-huh so there was a guy i wanna say i wanna i wanna say his name was tom todd beard or something like that this guy used to text me every day when they were when they started their mma thing telling me he was gonna kill me like legitimately legitimately gonna kill me yeah you punk motherfucker yeah i'm gonna fucking kill you you don't understand who i am and what i've done and this and that i think this guy would get drunk or do drugs every night or whatever his deal was this guy would call me text me and threaten my life every day i used to go fuck you and this you said fuck you oh i got oh yeah oh man especially back then yeah but yeah but i mean that this is the type of shit that went on in the early days this this guy this guy who was one of the owners of affliction was like one of the you know not not a good human let's put it that way what about the business side of it it's tough to make money in this business yeah we weren't making money so you know trying to build this thing corrupt corrupt the guys that work for in demand pay per view at the time were not good dudes you know and that thing was a fucking total monopoly god i wish i could remember his name right now he used to run-in demand and he was a fucking bad guy then he then he comes over and starts running directv who we always had a great relationship with and he's the reason we left directv and said fuck it we'll just go streaming then yeah i don't remember his name i'd have to ask lorenzo so in general just in this whole space there's a lot of yeah it's just shady people everybody you deal with is you're dealing with a lot of lot of different forces and and and your your your hands are in a lot of different businesses you know from the venue business to the merchandise business to the video game business the pay per view business you know the list goes on and on of all the different types of the production business of all these different you know when i first started this i we had a production team that was the production team that was in it before we bought it so there was this there was this incident with phil barone where phil barone we did an interview with him and barone flips out mhmm in the interview when they're interviewing him and goes crazy and i thought it was awesome so i'm like yeah we're gonna lead this in we're gonna lead this interview in and the and the production guys were arguing with me they're like we can't leave this in this is totally unprofessional and i said i don't give a shit this is this is what we're doing we're gonna we're gonna do this and clip it like this and do it like that we're sitting in the venue that night and i lean over to lorenzo because the fight's coming up i go wait till you see this fucking interview with barone they didn't fucking do it they didn't do it these guys were guys that were freelance guys that worked for showtime at the time or one of something like that i literally went got up from my fucking seat went back there kicked the fucking door of the truck open and i said you motherfuckers you ever do that again and i'll fire every fucking one of you let's just put it this way i ended up firing every one of them anyway and and going with a whole new crew but these were the type of things that early on you you know there's so much stuff i mean i could sit here for fucking three days and walk you through all the stuff that used to go on back in those days but it was the wild wild west man but how'd you figure out how'd you know how to deal with all this mess first of all to fire people to fire people that aren't doing a good job all that like how to be a leader how to be well that's the thing too i mean business leader get get getting in in the early days there was two employees me and another girl that you that that worked for me for my company before i started doing this and then we slowly started to bring people on and you start to build a team then before you know it we had ten people i mean we used to do our christmas parties back then too there'd be eight to ten people at our christmas party you know but a lot of it is you'll learn as you go you know you know what me and the fertitas knew about production when we bought this ufc we had like i wanna say we had two or three weeks to pull off an event this is what we knew about production really jack shit so we had to dive in and we had to learn it we had to figure it out and we we knew what we wanted we knew what we liked we knew what what we're looking for it's just about building building a good team and and i think that's one of the things if if you wanna talk about what i've accomplished in the last you know twenty five years of my life i've been really good at building teams already have a vision of what you want the final thing to look like and then build a team that can bring that to life hundred percent you you well you you you have to have the vision without the vision there's nothing so that that's sort of what i do yeah i i i am the vision part of the of this thing we're gonna open a a pi in mexico we're gonna do this we're gonna do that you know and then and then you you build the team to to come in and help execute a lot of people that do fighting promotions fail you succeeded against long odds what's the secret to your success if you would just looking back over the years well the secret to success i would say first of all is passion and consistency you have to love what you do you have to get up every day and i i i i get here every day at nine thirty in the morning when we sold in two thousand sixteen a lot of people in the company made a lot of money and they all took off and they retired yeah right other than the fertitas i made the most money i'm still here i get here at nine thirty every morning last night i left here at eight thirty yeah you know and i don't know how late i'm gonna be here tonight but i love what i do we get up every day and grind i work just as hard now as i did back then the difference between back then and now is i don't have to do a bunch of the shit that i don't really like to do like budget meetings i don't like budget meetings i sat through enough fucking budget meetings horrible budget meetings horrible you know we're losing you know millions of dollars a year and i'm in these in these budget meetings you know so i get to pick and choose what i do these days back in the early days you don't get to pick and choose you have to be involved in everything yeah so cost you're just looking at cost a hundred percent you literally go through line by line every fucking number in the company and where did the money go and how can we save costs how can we do this better how can we you know they are they they they are brutal and they're multiple times a week and probably helps to deeply appreciate how much this shit costs though a hundred percent well you have to know that yeah in the early days when you start your business you have these people who when i hear them say you know what i i wanna work for myself i wanna create my own schedule and i wanna do all the the yeah it's just it's it if if that's your thought process going into it you're never gonna be successful you have to pay attention to every single detail of the business early on you're involved in everything there's no days off there's no birthdays there's no fucking christmas there's none of that shit i literally moved the birth of my second son for a chocolate elf fight we had a chocolate elf fight coming up and i and they're like yeah your son's gonna be born on this date and i'm like yeah that's not gonna work we're gonna have to take them earlier yeah so they literally gave my wife a c section and and and took my son early you were all in all in yeah and the fascinating thing like you said you you've said that you could care less about money you're doing this for for the love of it yeah i was doing this when i was broke yeah and i'm doing this now when i'm not broke i'm doing this because i love it and i and i i feel like there's so much more to do and this is truly my passion in life it's like the sphere we're doing the sphere why why would i do the sphere it's gonna cost me a bunch of money it's it's it's really challenging most people think it can't be pulled off and you're looking at weird angles different things going on inside other than the fight and all this other stuff but yeah i'm doing it because it's awesome and it's challenging and it's hard and i think that if anybody can do it right it's us so why not take that challenge it's actually why i'm here i'm going to this fear for the first time because i'm hanging out with darren arnoski who put together the thing that's in there now and i can't believe you're thinking of i don't know how you're gonna solve that puzzle there's many puzzles to solve for this one okay many puzzles so how can you speak to that like what are interesting challenges that you're encountering yeah so there's a lot so you have the octagon right and then behind it is the world's biggest screen yeah ever right so what is the theme how do you program it first of all it's super expensive to shoot and and and you know the format for the sphere angles we were talking about today i just had a big meeting today about the sphere this afternoon and making sure that all my departments all the details that i want all start to come together here in the next two weeks i want the creative the commercial i have some goals i will tell people as we get closer what i'm looking to achieve with this other than putting on one of the greatest most unique sporting events of all time and probably the greatest combat sporting event of all time but yeah there's i mean there's challenges there's a laundry list of challenges for this thing and and not to mention the fact that it's on independent mexican independence day and we're gonna weave in the whole history of combat in mexico yeah into this event so but the production i mean this is hilarious because you were just talking about knowing nothing about production somebody and now you're tackling the sphere the hardest production effort ever and that will be live it'll be live it'll be live on pay per view yeah it'll be live in the arena yeah and it'll also be in movie theaters nice so there'll be a it'll be shown will it be shown at the sphere later too like will you try to create a doing a doc on it nice the making of the sphere yeah well you feeling good about it oh yeah i feel incredible about it i i can't wait it's gonna be it's gonna be fun i can't wait to see how you solve the puzzle thank you another guy that i feel like could care less about the money is joe rogan how important is he to the ufc to the rise of the ufc and what in general do you love about joe it's a fact he doesn't care about money and he did the first thirteen shows for free for us yeah you know what i mean that was at a time when we were hurting and he's like wait a minute you you want me to do the commentary you you're saying that i get to sit in the best seat in the house and watch these fights for free yeah yeah i'm in yeah so and then obviously when we turn things around we we made it up to joe but joe is one of the things that i loved early on about so i'll tell you the story so we buy the ufc mhmm they're based in new york we're we're moving the the the corporate offices to vegas so i have to fly out to new york go into the offices and and start going through everything and figuring out what needs to come back to vegas and what we can just throw away so they literally had a a vhs machine and a tv and there were a million tapes in this place man mhmm so i didn't know what tapes were these definitely we have to keep or these we don't need so i had to sit there and go through every single tape and i popped in a tape and there was an interview on the ivory keenan wayans show mhmm right the the oldest wayans brother and mhmm he had a talk show at the time and he had joe rogan the guy from fear factor on the show yeah and he was promoting fear factor but all he would talk about was ufc that's true and yeah that's true he was talking about how people think that these guys in the martial arts movies are are tough and could do and he was talking about what ufc fighters would do to these mhmm these martial arts guys if they ever got their hands on them and i was like this is exactly what i need a guy who isn't afraid to speak his mind and knows the sport inside and out but more importantly is super passionate about it and loves it so when you see joe rogan on camera and i was talking about the paid doc talking heads that they had in hbo boxing that were terrible joe rogan does not come off as a paid talking head he comes off as a guy who loves this and so early on no media would cover us so i had to buy my way onto radio so we do these radio tours right and they would drop us in you'd have to get up at three thirty in the morning in vegas on the west coast and they because they're there at six thirty in the morning in new york and boston and florida and all these other places so they drop you into these markets to do radio mhmm right and the fighters were horrible at it fighters getting up at three thirty in the morning especially leading up to a fight never good yeah they sound like they're tired they act like they're tired and they definitely act like they don't wanna be on there and it it's it's bad radio what you can have is bad radio so the only two people that could pull off these radio tours were me and joe rogan mhmm so me and joe rogan would alternate doing these radio tours all over the country just talking about fighting talking about what this whole thing is like getting people excited two guys that are really into it and passionate about it and love it and and and can and and it's one of the things about rogan too when when early on nobody understood the ground game mhmm joe rogan would walk you through what was happening literally before it would happen he would tell you the setup what was gonna come next and everything he just absolutely articulate it perfectly brilliantly and people at home started to understand and the the impact that joe rogan has had and continues to have on this sport is immeasurable he's the biggest podcaster in the world and he is on the ufc pay per views you know fourteen times a year and he's always talking about the sport it's immeasurable what this guy has has has done for this company and the sport yeah still to this day like i'll have dinner with him offline he'll just talk fighting yep just loves it it's true loves every aspect of it yep joe rogan is is is one of those guys i saw that early on when why would you go after the fear factor guy yeah you know to be such a key component to not only the company but to the sport i saw it in the fucking interview on ivory keenan wayans i value loyalty a lot and i remember there was a moment not too long ago maybe a year ago and i was sitting with joe and he had a phone call with you joe was getting canceled for something and they didn't want him commentating the fights and you on the phone offered your resignation over this i got teary eyed over that that's such a you're a good man you know thank you that was powerful anybody who is with me has been with me knows when you're with me you're with me it's a two way street it's not a yeah it's not a one way street i'm not one of these guys that is gonna roll over and it's like going through covid i wasn't laying any of these peep some of these people have been with me for twenty years we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna lay them off mm-mm this motherfucker will burn burn yeah before i would do that to my people it's just it's just never none of that type of stuff yeah is ever going to happen while i'm here i can't say what's gonna happen when i leave but when i'm here the people who are with me and have been with me they they know exactly what's up and joe knows what's up and and and and and it's and again it's a two way street joe rogan has been very loyal to me and i am very loyal to joe rogan lorenzo another guy you've close friendship with you seem to have been extremely effective together as as business partners what's what's the magic behind that yeah how can you explain that i love him lorenzo and i work really well together because we have two different personalities right i'm the guy that always i'm i'm going here lorenzo was always here right you could walk in a room and say lorenzo you just lost ten million dollars lorenzo you just won ten million dollars it never changes and i'm a guy that goes like this right so we we almost balance each other out there's a lot of things that he's really fucking good at and there's a lot of things that i'm really fucking good at and they're both on the opposite sides of the spectrum so that level headed thing was useful when the ufc was losing money and it was unknown whether it's gonna survive yeah those low points hundred percent what's incredible when you think of this the story of the ufc at the time the casino business was cranking right and station casinos was killing it and stations their money from stations is what was funding the ufc then in the o eight nine crash the ufc was killing it in o eight and o nine and you know the casino businesses were hurting mhmm so timing on everything the way that it all worked out couldn't have worked out better for them and obviously for all of us when you think about the ufc and how big it is and how far it reaches and how many people it touches the fertitta's brothers made a two million dollar investment then put in like another forty four million and look at how many lives that investment has changed over the last twenty five years it's fascinating and it's also crazy just forget the business of it just the effect it has on the history of humanity in terms of this what we do or descendants of apes that fight and this is like the organizations that catalyze the the innovation in how we fight right it's crazy it it created a whole new sport that that people all over the world participate in now literally there isn't a place on earth that we can't get a fighter from now you said in the ufc two ninety nine post fight press conference that sometimes fighters might complain that you know they get matched up on even odds but that's actually when legends are made i think you gave dustin poirier as an example can you elaborate on that a little bit like what makes a legend what makes greatness in a fight so behind the scenes fighters are a very paranoid bunch of people they're very paranoid and there's been this this this theme with fighters where they're trying to get me beat right mhmm we don't determine who wins and loses if we did we'd be the wwe okay you do i'm the bells and whistles guy i make sure that as many people that we can possibly let know that you're fighting on saturday know that you're fighting on saturday who you are who you're going against and why people should give a shit that's what i do right then the night you show up i put on the best live event that i possibly can and i put on the best television show that i possibly can once that door shuts it's all up to you you determine whether you lose or not and if you get into a position where you become so paranoid that you think that the powers that be here are against you and you you you try to steer yourself away from certain fights and and that that's one of the big things that happens in these other organizations and these other organizations the inmates run the asylum mhmm right so if they don't wanna fight bad enough these other companies don't push and they don't do this and they don't we put on the best possible matchups that we can make and in this business you might be an older fighter but if you're still ranked in the top ten there's young guys coming for you mhmm killers young killers are coming out and they want your position right so you being the the the veteran that you are have to prepare yourself to go in and you know everybody was saying when we made that fight with saint denis that poirier was in big trouble that's awesome mhmm that that helps build the entire thing that poirier and then poirier goes out and does what he did that night that's what makes fucking legends it's interesting because like sometimes being the underdog is a really good thing for the long term story of who you are as a fighter especially when you're a big name and a name that people recognize and a name that people know and you know and they're like oh man i remember israel adesanya and and and sean strickland mhmm hundred out of a hundred people knew for a fact that israel is gonna win that fight yeah yeah and here comes strickland and and we could go on for days with this you know what i mean that is what creates legendary moments legendary fights and it's what builds stars and legends i mean arguably conor mcgregor with jose aldo yep conor mcgregor with a bunch of people in the beginning people said he couldn't wrestle people said he wouldn't be able to defend a takedown blah blah blah blah nate diaz against conor mcgregor you know what i mean mhmm and and conor mcgregor against khabib yeah underdog probably but if you won there's an opportunity to win if you won that's that's legend forming he's now in the conversation for the greatest of all time yep without argument and if you look at the way that habib ran through so many people connor hung in there you know yeah and it could have been made a fight of it it could have been what do you think about that matchup it's one of the one of the greats one of the great matchups that you've made conor mcgregor versus khabib yeah i mean at the time i was incredibly criticized for putting together the spot that had the the scene with the boss in it yeah you know yeah the fucking media is but they're saying that i was pandering to the you know to the violence that happened and trying i'm telling you a story telling you a story of how we got here and how big this fight is and how bad the blood is between these guys and i mean i think that's what we do the best job at is telling the fucking stories of why i we go into monday it's fight week we got a whole list of things that we do fight week right and then you get right down to the press conference on thursday the weigh ins on friday and then the fights on saturday now my people fly back home they go to bed on sunday night and it's groundhog day we wake up again on monday and it starts all over again every weekend every saturday for a year mhmm so there's lots of stories that need to be told there's lots of when you think about what i compete with whatever takes your attention on a saturday night is my competitor so you're always trying to build a foundation for great stories and like if the fighters step up they step up and they can together create greatness that's it that's exactly right so when we are online like when you get to the ufc i mean you just saw it with mvp you're gonna see it with kayla harrison and so many others that that that have come from other organizations and they get here they notice immediately the difference between fighting here and fighting wherever they were before it's not even comparable to the impact it has on you when you leave whatever organization you're with and you come to the ufc and i think that it gives them a sense of holy shit i i i can really i mean mvp when he came i mean there were probably more people at the press conference than any fight he'd ever fought in in in in bellator you know what i mean and you feel that energy and you feel that you feel the difference of the impact of being here and i think it takes a lot of these guys to another level yeah just the aura of it like this is where you're supposed to step up yeah it's the way people feel about ted talks when they're giving lectures right this is your moment you get fifteen minutes and this you better say some interesting shit yeah and kayla harrison by the way is a badass i can't wait to see what happens there she was walking around with like this sleeveless shirt the night of the fights and holy shit she is jacked man it's crazy two time olympic gold medalist right you you don't fuck with those people you you won a medal you're you're you're made of something special so true especially in judo yeah especially in american judo where it's not you don't have many training partners that are great so you that's what i'm saying fucking work for it ridiculous question but who's in the conversation for the greatest of all time john jones so you've you've talked about john jones but what are the metrics involved here he's never been beat he destroyed everybody at light heavyweight which at the time was the toughest weight class in the company in the sport and then i moved up to heavyweight won easily at heavyweight and and and when you look at a guy and you look at what he was doing outside the octagon at the same time which shouldn't be part of it shouldn't be part of the the equation but when you do wow john john there's no debate nobody can debate who's the greatest of all time it's absolutely positively john jones he's never lost no he's never been beaten the octagon ever so that's one of the metrics like pure sheer dominance but there's others right there you could losing sometimes is a catalyst for greatness i don't disagree but when you've never lost right it's this you've never lost we we've never found somebody and and all the the other thing is that you have to put it factor into is longevity mhmm how long he's because sometimes with a lot of these guys the sport pass them by you get younger guys that are faster this that and the sport evolves nobody's been able to beat jon jones oh and the other thing that you measure is you know when you said dominance it's true if you're this guy that has unbelievable power and you're just going in you're just fucking knocking everybody out and nobody's ever pulled you into the deep water before mhmm that was when my opinion of jon jones started to change gustafsson took him into the deep water gustafsson hit him with some shit he'd never been hit with gustafson tested him and put jon jones in a place where i i bet if you sat down and interviewed jon jones going into the deep rounds of that jon jones thought he was going to die you know what i'm saying and he was he's willing to go there and he kept going he was he was willing willing to do whatever it took to win that fight and it breaks my heart because he beat dc and dc is one of the greatest of all time that's the thing too and and i believe that dc doesn't get the credit he deserves because of the jon jones thing when you look at dc and what he's accomplished right and jon jones beat him twice yeah it's undeniable you can hate all you want jon jones is the greatest of all time do you think habib was tested enough i think that habib had the potential to be in the running for that he didn't he just didn't stick around a lot first of all he he he had injuries that that that you know he should have been where he got a lot sooner had he not had the injuries that he had and the setbacks in his career but there's no doubt khabib is one of the all time greats what's the the good the bad and ugly of your relationship with connor there's literally no ugly connor mcgregor has been an incredible partner to work with everybody thinks that connor if connor showed up to things on time yeah there wouldn't be one fucking bad thing i could say about connor yeah you know what i mean only being late to shit if you fucking said put a gun to my fucking head right and said don't lie motherfucker tell me all the bad things about conor mcgregor i'd say the guy doesn't show up on time that's it that's it if conor mcgregor showed up to shit on time and sometimes he does sometimes he does he'd be he'd be he's been a great partner if you look at what a huge superstar he became the fights that he was involved in me tell you what conor mcgregor never did we never walked in a room and said conor this guy just fell out we want you to fight this guy and he was like no way i'm not taking this fucking risk i'm at this point in my career where my money my this my that he was like fuck it let's do it you know he'd always say let's do it the other thing that conor mcgregor never did no matter how big he was or whatever it was and we're heading into a fight oh conor this guy just fell out aldo fell out we were looking for another yeah i'll do it but i'm gonna need another fucking two hundred thousand i'm gonna need another million dollars i'm gonna conor mcgregor never did that kind of chicken shit you know bullshit kind of stuff he he never did any of that connor was as solid a guy as you could possibly work with just fuck it i'll do it i'll do it literally would there's actually a scene because we were filming something i don't know if it was embedded or what we were filming at the time me and lorenzo walk into his house that he rented here in vegas and i'm pretty sure it was when aldo fell out and we're telling him this that and we're looking at some options he says i'm going to the gym when i'm done working out let me know you know he just woke up out of bed he's in his fucking underwear and he gets hit with this and he's like alright i'm going to the gym let me know when i get out who i'm fighting doesn't care doesn't wanna know doesn't want any more money nothing fucking shows up and he delivers yeah yeah so you know connor has been incredibly successful he's made a lot of money and you know he's had his ups and downs outside and inside the octagon but as for a guy who was you know on the dole and was a plumber he's actually a really smart businessman and he's been one of the best partners that i've ever had in the history of the sport yeah an an important part of the history of the ufc big he opened it up to all kinds of new eyes yep he literally you know set europe australia canada and many other parts of the world on fire man he he he he he was our our first legit megastar and i personally think he doesn't get enough credit for just how good he was as a fighter like people love to talk shit about conor so i suppose that's part of his magic and and but it but it comes with success yeah when you're successful there's always people out there that are gonna talk shit you know you always have a bunch of know nothing do nothing fucking losers that that love to talk shit you think if you were to do it all over again habib is the right matchup yeah that listen you you the the thing that you can't do is avoid match ups yeah you know what i mean this is what we're talking about when you talk about being a legend conor mcgregor needed khabib khabib needed conor mcgregor it's you can hate each other as much as you want but you have to fight these other legendary bad motherfuckers to to yourself become a legend i mean it's like jon jones needed cyril gahn mhmm right and cyril gahn needed jon jones because if cyril could have beat jon the first guy if anybody can ever figure it out and beat john jones it's a big deal and it's almost like your obligation as a fighter right and when you think about jon jones became who he is today and the reason i'm sitting here telling you how great he is because all these other guys gave him the opportunity mhmm to beat them right or they beat john you it's all about giving these other guys the opportunity saint denis right poirier gave him the opportunity to come in and beat him that's how this all works it's the two of them together the two fighters together you have to have them both listen i could line up i could line up a bunch of no name bums that jon jones could run through that's what they do in all the other organizations yeah right we would have nothing to fucking talk about right now that's why luckily a perfect record in the ufc is not as important as who you fought how you fought so true but when you have a perfect record in the ufc holy shit right yeah that's what you would when when you can have a perfect record in the ufc you are absolutely one of the most special athletes on planet earth you and trump are friends i just talked to ivanka last night and i bought her experience at the at the in the miami event she loves it she's training too you're talking about getting girls to train she's trained and the kids are training yeah her father's the biggest fucking fight fan on the planet calls me all the time to talk about the fights and and don junior said that i'm like the only guy on earth that he bros out with like you know we we it's it's funny when you talk about how powerful fighting is right this last miami event the president of ecuador and the president of spain wow both posted about the fights right habib beat connor putin was on facetime before he even made it to the to the locker room trump sitting president ex president watching all the fights calling wants to talk about the fights valentina shevchenko every time she goes home she meets with the president of the country the list goes on and on and on the most powerful elon musk zuckerberg i mean the list goes on and on and on the most powerful people in the world are all obsessed with fighting when did you first discover that trump loves fighting so i first discovered that trump was a big fight fan obviously you saw him part of all the big you're talking about how big boxing fans we were he was a part of all the big fights back then but when we first bought the ufc this thing was so bad venues didn't even want us and we ended up doing you know our first event in atlantic city at the trump taj mahal now think about this at that time trump brand here ufc brand i mean i can't go low enough and he had us at his venue two times back to back showed up for the first fight of the night and stayed till the last fight of the night then after that any good thing that would ever happen to me in my career trump would reach out whether it was we were on the front page of the new york times at one time and he said congratulations dana i always knew you guys were gonna do it little things like that but that that are big things and and mean a lot especially coming from a guy like him so he saw he saw something in you like this is gonna be hundred percent he definitely saw it and then comes fifteen sixteen whenever it was i don't remember but he called me and he said listen if you don't wanna do this i completely understand but i would be honored if you would speak at the national republican convention for me and i'm not a very political guy you know what i mean and everybody told me not to do it do not do this but i was like why would i not do this this guy's been been great to me you know and i did it and our relationship is just like you know what i mean i consider donald trump to be one of my very very good friends any favorite stories i mean there's so many stories i mean one once once he he he won the election like i'd be at work and i'd be down the hall was in the matchmaking room whatever and my secretary would tell the president's on the phone fucking come running down the hallway and grab the phone and he'd wanna talk about the the fight that was coming up or the fight that happened or i'd be in my car and i'd answer the phone it's like hi this is the white house we have the president of the united states on the phone yeah you know that's a trip when that first starts happening and then just to to to to sum him up this is the kind of guy that you wanna talk about a fighter this is the most resilient human being i've ever met if you see the shit that this guy's going through publicly every day and i'll call him on the phone as a friend and be like hey you good how you doing mhmm unfazed unfazed like nothing's going on and they'll start talking to me about this and that and all this other shit one time there's only been one time i've never talked about this publicly but one time i called him and he was not good he he was a mess and i've never heard him like that and i've never seen him like that when ivana died the only time i've ever seen him fucked up obviously as soon as i heard it i reached out and i have never they look at all the stuff that's gone on with trump all the bad stuff that they say they're trying to attack him they're trying to ruin him unfazed i called him that day and he was this is the first time i've ever seen that guy busted up and and and not good but that says something that that's the only time hundred percent percent that guy is i mean walking through the fire get rattled he he will walk through fire he's a absolute savage you think he wins the presidential election i don't know man it's gonna depend on how this whole i politics is the most dirtiest scummiest thing on planet earth man and and who knows how this is all gonna play out it's it's all dirty it's all ugly and you know obviously i'm rooting for him and and and i'm behind him and and i hope he does but we'll see what's dirtier the the fighting game in the early days or politics there's nothing dirtier than politics nothing there's literally nothing dirtier alright it is the dirtiest thing on on planet earth to get that on record another guy who doesn't seem to be fazed by the fire i've gotten to know him is elon i have to ask you it's a bit a bit of fun you were a part of thinking about putting together zuck versus elon right i trained with both i did a phone call with elon and you when you when we were training on the mat yep you really think that could have been a good fight it would have been the biggest fight ever done the spectacle of it two of the most powerful wealthiest men in the world right lots of guys talk shit and go back and forth and sue each other and do all this that these two guys were literally talking about facing each other in the octagon and fighting there's nothing and they're they're in a business that's looked at as geeky you know what i mean they're they're they're tech nerds they're this they're that these are two dudes that we're willing to throw down and fight and and and and you know as well as i do there's a lot of public speculation about this i was taken serious real time and working on this thing i mean i had projections i had numbers i was looking at venues i was on the phone with the fucking coliseum in italy you name it i i was in it these guys were serious and this was something that was really gonna happen and i'll tell you right now the in the short amount of time that it was it was going down it was fun i was having a blast with it what do you think about tyson tyson fighting jake paul i love mike tyson and i'm i'm not a fan of anybody fighting at at our age but he's a grown man obviously and you know he's he's gonna do what he's gonna do but at least i know i talked to i talked to his wife a couple days ago and he's taken this serious and he's trained it for it and you know so we'll see how it plays out why do you think he fights though like what is that about is there a broader lesson there about fighters well i think great fighters i think that mike tyson is actually one of those unique guys who has crossed over any of these other boxers mhmm that that that from his era they have no way of making money other than fighting mike tyson has made a lot of money outside of fighting i mean tyson still has that aura you could be at a restaurant and he walks in and you're like holy fuck mike tyson's here you know he still has that type of aura and and energy in a room and and and he makes lots of money outside of the ring i i just i think that he ends up getting these offers that he can't refuse oh you think it's financial so how much i mean that's a good question to ask you work with a lot of fighters for how many of them is it about money and for how many is it about the fact the pure love of fighting well the guys that get into it for the right reason are the guys who get into it for greatness because you wanna be the fucking best right and when you're in it for that reason right you love it and you wanna be looked at as the best ever and and you have the talent the money happens right then you have other guys who get in i believe me i've dealt with fighters who just wanted to be famous and just wanted to make money you know what i mean and it's you know listen it it is what it is it's it's it's your it's your life and and and you live it the way that you want and and do your thing but the ones that are beloved are the guys who really wanna be fucking great and they're the ones that are remembered and i mean when you look at tyson in his early years when he came up under castellamato i mean he was a student of the game he he he loved everything he became completely infatuated with the fight game then he became such a massive superstar it's almost like the whole thing starts to turn on you you know all the things that come at you at a young age and that kind of money and it's it's tough it's tough to navigate and get through and you know you you say something like that and people are like oh poor him he had fucking a hundred million dollars and couldn't at that age and with all the shit that people talk and all the things that you gotta put up with and the fame damn a lot of people deal with fame some people handle it really well and some people don't and the perfect example of that was forrest griffin and stefan bonner mhmm you know they fought that that unbelievable fight on the ultimate fighter everything blew up after that force dealt with fame really well and and and stefan did not that was a special fight really was what do you think attracted people to that fight so that that made that was a big leap for the ufc it was everything it was everything it was everything why do you think people love that fight what what attracted people to that fight why did they change everything well what happened that night is that the rest of the show was a disaster you know we had the co main event and the main event diego sanchez ran through kenny florian in seconds oh my god that was that was terrible and the fights that led up to that weren't anything to talk about either then stefan and forrest got in there and just went toe to toe in this unbelievable slugfest live on free television when cable still mattered and what i heard was at the time you know you had people picking up the phone going are you watching this show i'm like the the numbers just started climbing then you got a razor thin decision who's gonna win you got the crowd stomping their feet it sound like a train was going through the place and everybody's chanting one more round mhmm me and the fertitta brothers get together and we talk we're gonna give them both contracts so we give them both contracts and the place erupts it just it couldn't have been a more perfect fight at the most perfect time and it just it it it all came together it's almost like this was meant to be you know what i mean yeah yeah we had so many problems with spike tv at the time right because halfway through the season the president of the company got fired all the things that we thought we were gonna get that year you know we we we have this runaway hit show and normally at that time when you would see runaway hit shows there'd be commercials it'd be on be on billboards it'd be on the side of buses in la and new york we got none of that right we didn't even know if we're gonna get a you know a a second season coming out of that right and when that fight was over i swear to god i was like i don't even give a fuck we're gonna end up somewhere now after this fight and we didn't even make it out of the building that night the the the the spike guys did the contract with us in the alley on a fucking napkin after the fight so so you saw the you already saw the magic of the fight itself it captured that happened yeah and all the shit and at that time i didn't know what the ratings not like we were streaming and we could see what we were we had no idea but i knew you just knew this was i knew what what is it it's like just two people being willing to stand toe to toe and just go to war and and and when you think about what was at stake there there was a car remember the kia yeah the the the winner got a kia right that that's that's what was the fucking right and stefan and forrest yeah the will to win they both wanted to win that fight so bad it was bigger than the kia probably well you you know forrest drove that kia to like two hundred thousand miles yeah the biggest mistake kia ever made was not doing a fucking commercial with forrest griffin about that car forrest griffin loved that car so much he drove it i think he still has it it's got like two hundred thousand miles on it that car i mean you couldn't have a better fucking commercial than that they they and we reached out to them too i said kia should know about this yeah they fucking blew it you got a bunch of you you know how those guys yeah yeah are in the the the business world they don't fucking get anything maybe it was about the kia then it was about winning they they both wanted to win the ultimate fighter so bad yeah it's the kia it's it's the win it's the it's the the the contract you get the whole thing but i think at that point you even forget all of that when you're in there you probably just there's a primal thing where like i'm not backing down they're both bad dudes they were both real fighters at the end of the that's why the fight was so great yeah you know what i mean they just throw it all all the caution to the wind and just fight yep those are some of the greatest moments in the fc too when no problem the technique is not kinda falls apart and you're just like well it's because you're in those deep rounds you've had you've been through a war now it's all about heart and dog who who can dig deeper and who's got it and who wants it who wants it i mean we all know when that when that moment happens in a fight when you see that both of these guys are fucking exhausted and for people that are watching this people that don't know a lot of everybody thinks they know a lot about fighting ninety nine point nine percent of the people out there don't know fucking jack shit about fighting or what it takes to do what these people do but when you get into those later rounds and fatigue sets in and and then fatigue makes you start to fucking doubt yourself and and and then you start to wonder can can i even make it through the rest of this round and then you start to think am i gonna fucking die right now and these kids dig fucking deep and they just like you said all the other shit flies out the window and now they're just on fucking autopilot to fight and win those are definitely the best fights you'll ever see in any combat sport i mean that saying is true like the exhaustion makes cowards of us all i mean there there's something about because i i've competed a lot in jiu jitsu so there's the violence of being hit too but even just exhaustion yep it makes you question everything so true it just takes you to this some weird place where your brain starts to think you're going to die for sure your your brain starts to think like why am i doing this all these excuses all this i love that shit and then i love that shit the the truly heroic action is to say fuck it in that moment and just get in there when you think about these fights that you see in the ufc every fucking saturday when these these men and women get to this point where they're they've been in the dogfight yet they keep fucking going and you keep trying to win you can't imagine what's going on inside their heads you know self doubt and all these other things that come into play when exhaustion sets in and they fucking power through it yeah those moments sometimes they're not they don't have a glorious knockout at the end but your decision in the third round or the fifth round to still keep pushing forward not running hundred percent that's a that doesn't matter what happened that like that is a person winning a battle over themselves so true it's so true and it happens every fucking weekend it's so impressive i say it all the time the the the people that are involved in this sport are this much of the population the people that make it to the top five are incredibly unique special human beings man it's it's fucking awesome you love gambling i do what's the biggest win of your gambling career maybe psychologically if not financially well two things i i i won a million dollar hand one night it's happened one time a million dollar hand one night at mandalay bay and then one summer i beat i beat caesars for twelve million throughout the summer throughout the summer yeah and then i'm on a pretty good run right now too this is blackjack yeah what's the biggest loss biggest loss was i would here here is i would call this the biggest loss for many different reasons this this is what you know you live and you learn in life and you you know you you figure things out as you go along so one night i'm over at the at the rio right and they got big sweets over there so i go over there with some buddies and we we got one of the sweets and we have some dinner and we start drinking right so we're having some drinks at dinner and blah blah blah starts to ramp up having a good time and i make my way down to the thai limit room we start gambling and i continue to drink having a blast i end up leaving and going home that night and i lost like eighty grand right so i wake up the next morning i'm like fuck those motherfuckers got me for eighty thousand last night and dah dah dah dah so i'm at work the next day and the host over there calls me and he says hey dana are you coming back you do you still need the room that you guys had where you ate and all this shit used to and i said no you i don't need the room but don't get don't don't get too comfortable with my fucking eighty grand i'm coming back for it yeah dead fucking silence on the other end of the phone and he's like dana you lost three million dollars last night what the fuck are you talking about i i i i i only have a a million and a half dollar credit line yeah he goes yeah you you made us call the gm of the hotel and you started calling him a fucking pussy and and dah dah dah dah and i'm and i went yeah no that that that sounds like something i would do yeah so that's a real number that was the real number and then and then you know there's been a lot of cases where people are in vegas and they're like oh you know i lost all this money you know and they were giving me free drinks and i drank too much and i was taken advantage of yeah no no you stupid motherfucker man up you you got fucking drunk right they they didn't they they alcohol is free yeah but you don't have to fucking drink it you know what i mean and you know this this was a huge learning lesson for me so i never drank again when i when i was playing cards after that night oh damn but yeah i mean when you asked me that's the one that stands out in my head the most as far as having a bad loss and then you know of course i said call the gm and i started calling him a pussy at three o'clock in the morning so of course he did that is something i would absolutely do how do you deal with those psychologically do you when you gamble maybe this applies to fighting too do you love winning or hate losing more they go hand in hand so the way that i that i play is i live in vegas so twenty twenty four is a war for me i go to war in twenty four k all these nights that i play are little battles inside the war that i will fight in twenty four now at the end of the year we will tell you know tally up all these little battles and see where i stand on win wins and losses and you know there's there there there's lots of talk about out there about my gambling you know places that i've been kicked out of and things like that and i i i i do pretty well i do pretty well but it's it's it's what i like to do you know i i i don't gamble in a way that i would ever hurt myself or or hurt my family or you know i'm sure you've heard the norm mcdonald stories norm mcdonald lost like his entire personal wealth four times or something like that yeah that's that's not gonna happen to me so you you you manage it but just psychologically you're able to be even clear so so when i win it's awesome mhmm it's always great to win winning is is is a great feeling in business in sports in life and definitely in gambling losing is is is never fun but it's part of the game you know what i mean if if you wanna be in the game and it's sports it's business or whatever there's gonna be wins and there's gonna be losses and you have to take them both in stride and you have to be able to you know there's a lot of people when when you gamble right and you lose and you go into a deep dark depression i've seen this with guys that do it yeah get depressed gambling isn't for you you know if you are the type of person that's on social media and people say horrible things to you and you get depressed and dada you shouldn't be on social media you know what i mean these are all part of being in the game when you're in the fucking game great things happen and really bad things happen and you gotta take it all in stride and you gotta pick yourself up the next day strap your fucking shoes back on and get out there and go to fucking war again that's how it works that's some goggin shit right there alright i love that motivational speech it's the truth though yeah it is it's the truth though listen every day when you get out of bed life's standing right there to kick you in the fucking face man could be anything could be you get up and you walk downstairs you had a fucking flat tire and you're late for work and you got this and that life is gonna throw all kinds of crazy shit at you right and you have to be ready for it and you gotta fucking deal with it you can't curl up into a ball you can't run away from it you can't hide you have to take all this shit head on you have to get up every every day when i get up for out of bed i strap up and i'm getting ready for fucking war because i know i'm coming in here i know a bunch of bad shit's gonna happen that i'm gonna fucking deal with and yeah if that's not bad enough when i finally get out of here i'm probably gonna go to the casino and then i'm gonna get into another fucking war you know what i mean i thrive in chaos i actually love chaos i i everybody talks about retiring fuck that shit what what am i gonna do when i retire what would i do what would i well i like i like to go to war i like to battle i like to win sometimes i lose but then i have to come back from the loss and i love to build brands i love to set short term and long term goals and then knock them all down you know this is just the stuff that that that excites me and and and whether it's business or or gambling or i i like being a fan of things too like i like live music so when i find a like a band that i like i get excited to to to go watch the band live or a celtics game i love the fucking boston celtics and i love you know going to the games and watching them this is the year hopefully we're gonna fucking win it this year these are all things that make me happy and excite me in my life and it's funny because there's this post that i post maybe three four nights a week i also love this city i can't tell if the city of las vegas was built for me or i was built for this fucking city but i love it and and there's this turn on summerlin parkway right every night and it's dark and from there you can see the entire fucking city and it's all fucking lights and it's badass and i'm usually driving home after a fucking incredible day right this amazing day and and this unbelievable fucking life that i have and i have this just moment of gratitude yeah every time i take that turn and i'm like goddamn i love this fucking city and just every night when i go home i'm just so happy and grateful for this life that i have so you're grateful you're celebrating even if the day is full of shit yet full of problems you have to solve all of this you're still able to put that behind you i love that too i love problem solving i love i love taking things that seem impossible and fucking who what's been shit on more than this fucking company right here yeah powerslap right yeah this thing's a fucking beast yeah it's an absolute beast of in thirteen months that's the most successful thing i've ever been a part of and i love every fucking minute of it especially the negativity i love negativity so you almost feed on it that's great that's great you're a build freak i eat that shit for fucking breakfast man i love it what's your favorite movie about vegas casino yeah it would have to be casino yeah no doubt about it yeah do you ever see a movie that changed your life that that actually impacted your life in some way shape or form probably which one that's a good question i have to think i well i have a lot a lot because you know it could be one of them probably taught me about women you know forrest gump for me is a simple movie but it was it was a really good movie to show it remind because i've been really fortunate in my life like over and over and over and i don't think i deserve any of it so i just always felt like forrest gump so when i finally saw it it really connected with me it was like okay this this universe works in weird ways and stuff just materializes and you just kinda be good to people like put that good karma out there and it happens for you so that that was a movie like that i'm actually very superstitious about that mhmm i believe that that that what you what you put out you get back and i believe that when you have you should take care of other people and you should always try to bring people up with you and all that kind of stuff but the movie that changed the whole trajectory of my life uh-oh was vision quest yeah well yeah that that's a good one too yeah vision quest man i i fucking love that movie that's a good movie it's basically you know it's telling the story of a kid who really wasn't anybody in high school and nobody kinda knew who he was he wasn't popular or any of that kinda shit and he decided that that was the year that he was gonna make his mark and he was a good wrestler at a hundred and seventy eight pounds but he was gonna move down to one sixty something to take on the shoot the scariest guy and the whatever but there's all these little things in the movie that that really lay out what life is all about one of the parts is he's in a class and he's talking about the the teacher's talking about some poem and he says what does this poem mean to you well this little girl's walking through you know the park and all the leaves are falling off the trees and she realizes that she's gonna die someday and that a lot of people think they have all this time so they fucking waste it and they never go out and do what they really set out to do or accomplish or do anything great in their life that's one meaning then he's got the guy that he works with at work you know he's cutting weight and his nose is bleeding and all this shit and this guy keeps going why the fuck are you doing this pick that thing up and eat it like a fucking man this is ridiculous i don't know why you're doing this to yourself blah blah blah blah blah so then when he meets the girl and he gets to the point where he feels like he wants to quit right where does he go he goes to that guy's fucking apartment because he knows when he shows up at this guy's apartment he's gonna go yeah fuck this shit no he went to work he went to work just to talk to him and he wasn't at work he took the night off so he shows up at the fucking house at the shitty little fucking apartment that the guy lives in and the guy's putting a suit and tie on and shit he's like they said you called in sick what's going on he's like well yeah aren't you wrestling this guy tonight and he's like yeah but but why would you you're gonna get docked a nice pay and all of a sudden she says you know what man then it all gets laid out i get the goosebumps even telling you this fucking part is that play speech fuck pele yeah yeah what he's saying about you know i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm fucking cooking in a overnight hotel yeah fucking thing and i live in this shitty apartment yeah a human being can lift himself upside down and backwards and kick a ball into a fucking net and the whole stadium goes crazy and this guy runs around and i'm sitting here in my fucking apartment alone and i start crying yeah i start crying so the guy who's been shitting on him the whole fucking time actually really respects him for what he's done and sees what this kid is capable of doing and all this shit this just this fucking movie spoke to me on so many different levels and i think it's probably the most underrated movie of all time when you really break down the meaning of what this movie is about and and and it and it fucking really spoke to me that's probably the greatest movie on combat one on one combat i would agree ever made i would agree yeah and especially if you can really hear the messages that it's that it's that it's given you in this movie it's it's it's excellent you know what's funny they just did like the and i saw this after the fact which completely fucking pissed me off they did like the twenty five year or the thirty year thing mhmm it was filmed in spokane washington they showed the movie at a movie theater there and the cast members came out and spoke about it i would have fucking flown there for that are you shitting me i'd have been there in fucking thirty seconds to go up there and and and and be a part of that that that movie literally changed my life yeah i i suppose me too it made me it made me wanna wrestle i mean probably the reason i was maybe it made me love fall in love with wrestling well you know what's funny i wasn't even into wrestling at all and i didn't have to be for that movie to you know basic human story it's it's such a great movie i mean that's what fighting does it brings out the basic like the the the humanity of a person really like if for the people that choose to step up and step in the ring they and and then chase greatness and actually do it from like against the long odds that's why it's a beautiful game and it's so true i mean when you think about like i'm fifty four years old right now like that i mean it just fucking flew by yeah and you think when you're young that you have all this time you have no time there's there there's no time i mean one of the one of the quotes on the wall in the gym in there is you know there is no tomorrow from from from rocky three you know there is no tomorrow fuck that shit let's let's let's get all this shit done today do you think about your death i'm i'm not i'm not afraid of death not even a little bit i'm not afraid of it i don't know if that'll be the case when i'm facing it you know when i'm looking down the barrel of it yeah laying in a hospital bed somewhere but for now just squeezing as much as you can out of my bed hundred percent i literally i don't even like to sleep my life is so fucking awesome i don't even wanna go to bed at night i don't even wanna go to sleep i wanna stay up fucking i wish i could fucking do twenty four hours and never have to sleep that's how much i love my life what has watching thousands of fights over the years taught you about human nature about us humans i i don't care what color you are what country you come from or what language you speak we're all human beings fighting's in our dna we get it and we like it and it's true fighting is in our dna it's a part of who we are and you know no matter where you are fight breaks out it creates this fucking energy this buzz this sense of fear i mean a lot of different emotions happen in people when fights break out but one thing that that that is always the case everybody's watching man everybody's fucking all of their eyes are on the fight i mean we we're just in mexico fucking fight broke out like in the good seats like right here with the the seats they're super expensive yeah and security never fucking came yeah they just let these guys fight until they gassed out yeah and then everybody put their chairs back together and sat back down and fucking i literally got up from my table walked over and was watching this fight mhmm at the fights at the fights yeah i mean humans fight and humans love watching fighting absolutely and that was my thought process going into buying the ufc and i believe that this would work everywhere and thank god we were right well nana thank you for bringing this very human thing of fighting the art of it the science of it the the heroic stories the vision quest stories of it all boom
