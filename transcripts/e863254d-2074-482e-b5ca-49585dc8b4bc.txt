the following is a conversation with noe brown research scientist at fair facebook ai research group at meta ai he cocreated the first ai system that achieved superhuman level performance in no limit texas hold them both heads up and multiplayer and now recently he co created an ai system that can strategically out negotiate humans using natural language in a popular board game called diplomacy which is a war game that emphasizes negotiation and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this podcast we got true classic tee's

here's noam brown you've been a lead on three amazing ai projects so we got libratus that solved or at least achieved human level performance on no limit texas hold them poker with two players heads up you got pluribus that solved no limit texas hold them poker with six players and just now you have cicero these are all names of systems that solved or achieved human level performance on the game of diplomacy which for people who don't know is a popular strategy board game it was loved by jfk john f kennedy and henry kissinger and many other big famous people in the decades since so let's talk about poker and diplomacy today first poker what is the game of no limit texas hold'em and how is it different from chess well no limit texas hold them poker is the most popular variant of poker in the world so you know you go to a casino you play sit down at the poker table the game that you're playing is no limit texas hold them if you watch movies about poker like casino royale or rounders the game that they're playing is no limit texas hold them poker now it's very different from limit hold them in that you can bet any amount of chips that you want and so the stakes escalate really quickly you start out with like one or two dollars in the pot and then by the end of the hand you've got like a thousand dollars in there maybe so the option to increase the number very aggressively and very quickly right the no limit aspect is there's no limit to how much you can bet you know you in limit hold them there's like two dollars in the pot you you can only bet like two dollars but if you got ten thousand dollars in front of you you're always welcome to put ten thousand dollars into the pot so i got a chance to hang out with phil hellmuth who plays all these different variants of poker and correct me if i'm wrong but it seems like no limit rewards crazy versus the other ones rewards more kind of calculated strategy or or no because you're sort of looking from an from an analytic perspective is is strategy also rewarded in no limit access hold them i think both variants reward strategy but i think what's different about no limit hold them is it it's it's much easier to get jumpy you know you go in there thinking you're gonna lose you know you're gonna play for like a hundred dollars or something and suddenly there's like you know a thousand dollars in the pot a lot of people can't handle that can you define jumpy when you're playing poker you always want to choose the action that's going to maximize your expected value it's kinda like kind of like with investing right like if you're ever in a situation where you're the amount of money that's at stake is is gonna have a material impact on your life then you're gonna play in a more risk averse style you know if somebody makes a huge bet you're gonna if you're playing the limit hold them and somebody makes a huge bet there might come a point where you're like this is too much money for me to handle like i can't risk this amount and that's what throws a lot of people off so that's the big difference i think between no limit and limit what what about on the action side when you're actually making that big bet that's what i mean by crazy i was i was trying to refer to the the technical the the technical term of crazy meaning use the big jump in the bet to completely throw off the other person in terms of their ability to reason optimally i think that's right i think one of the key strategies in poker is to put the other person into an uncomfortable position and if you're doing that then you're you're playing poker well and there's a lot of opportunities to do that in no limit hold them you know you can have like fifty dollars in there you throw in a thousand dollar bet and you know that sometimes if you do it right it puts the other person in a really tough spot now it's also possible that you make huge mistakes that way and so it's really easy to lose a lot of money and no limit hold them if you don't know what you're doing but but there's there's a lot of upside potential too so when you build systems ai systems that play these games we'll talk about poker we'll talk about diplomacy are you are you drawn in in part by the beauty of the game itself ai aside or is it to you primarily a fascinating problem set for the ai to solve i'm drawn in by the beauty of the game when i i started playing poker when i was in high school and the idea to me that there is a correct an objectively correct way of playing poker and if you could figure out what that is then you're you know you're making unlimited money basically that's like a really fascinating concept to me and so i i was fascinated by the strategy of poker even when i was like sixteen years old it wasn't until like much later that i actually worked on poker ais so there was a sense that you can solve poker like in a way you can solve chess for example or checkers i believe checkers got solved right yeah checkers checkers is completely solved optimal strategy it's impossible to beat the ai yeah and so in that same way you could technically solve chess you could solve chess you could solve poker you could solve poker so this is this gets into the concept of a nash equilibrium okay so what is a nash equilibrium okay so in any finite two player zero sum game there is an optimal strategy that if you play it you are guaranteed to not lose an expectation no matter what your opponent does and this is kind of a radical concept to a lot of people but it's true in chess it's true in poker it's true in any finite two player zero sum game and to give some intuition for this you can think of rock paper scissors in rock paper scissors if you randomly choose between throwing rock paper and scissors with equal probability then no matter what your opponent does you are not going to lose an expectation you're not going to lose an expectation in the long run now the same is true for poker there exists some strategy some really complicated strategy that if you play that you are guaranteed to not lose money in the long run and i should say this is for two player poker six player poker is a different story yeah it's a beautiful giant mess when you say in expectation you're guaranteed not to lose in expectation what does in expectation mean poker is a very high variance game so you're gonna have hands where you win you're gonna have hands with your lose even if you're playing the perfect strategy you can't guarantee that you're gonna win every single hand but if you play for long enough then you are guaranteed to at least break even and and in practice probably win so that's an expectation the size of your stack generally speaking now that doesn't include anything about the fact that you can go broke it doesn't include any of those kinds of normal real world limitations you're talking in a in the theoretical world what about the the zero sum aspect how big of a constraint is that how big of a constraint is finite so finite's not a a huge constraint so i mean most games that you play are finite in size it's also true actually that there exists this like perfect strategy in many infinite games as well technically the game has to be compact there are like some edge cases where you don't have a nash equilibrium in a two player zero sum game so you can think of a game where you're like you know if we're playing a game where whoever names the bigger number is the winner mhmm there's no nash equilibrium to that game seventeen yeah exactly eighteen thought you beat you win again you're good at this i played a lot of games okay so that's and then the the zero sum aspect the zero sum zero sum aspect so there exists a nash equilibrium in non two player zero sum games as well and by the way just to clarify what i mean by two player zero sum i mean there's two players and whatever one player wins the other player loses so if we're playing poker and i win fifty dollars that means that you're losing fifty dollars now outside of two player zero sum games there still exists nash equilibria but they're not as meaningful because you know you can think of a game like risk yeah if everybody else at the in on the board decides to team up against you and take you out there's no perfect strategy you can play that's gonna guarantee that you win there there's just nothing you can do so outside of two player zero sum games there's no guarantee that you're going to win by playing a nash equilibrium have you ever tried to model in the other aspects of the game which is like the pleasure you draw from playing the game and then if you're a professional poker player if you're exciting even if you lose the you know the money you would get from the attention you get to the sponsors and all that kind of stuff is that that'd be a fun thing to model to model in or is that be make it sort of super complex to to include the human factor in its in its full complexity i think you bring up a couple good points there so i think a lot of professional poker players i mean they get a huge amount of money not from the actually playing poker but from the sponsorships and having a personality that people wanna tune in and watch that that's a big that's a big way to to make a name for yourself in poker i just wonder from an ai perspective if you create and we'll talk about this more maybe ai system that also talks trash and all that kind of stuff that that becomes part of the function to maximize so it's not just optimal poker play maybe sometimes you want to be chaotic maybe sometimes you wanna be suboptimal and you lose the the chaos and maybe sometimes you want to be overly aggressive because peep the audience loves that that's fascinating i think i think what you're getting at here is that there's a difference between making an ai that wins a game and an ai that's fun to play with right yeah yeah and or fun to watch so those are all different things fun to play with and fun to watch yeah and i think you know i've i've heard talks from like game designers and and they say like you know people that work on ai for actual recreational games that people play and they say yeah there's a big difference between trying to make an ai that actually wins and you know you look at a game like civilization the way that the ais play is not optimal for trying to win they're they're playing a different game they're trying to have personalities they're trying to be fun and engaging and that makes for a better game yeah and we also talk about npcs npcs i just talked to todd howard who's the the creator of fallout and the elder scrolls series and starfield the new game coming out and the creator of what i think is the greatest game of all time which is skyrim and the npcs there the ai that governs that whole game is very interesting but the npcs also are super interesting and considering what language models might do to npcs in an open world rpg role playing game it's super exciting yeah honestly i'm i think this is like one of the first applications where we're gonna see like real consumer interaction with large language models i i guess like sky elder scrolls six is in development now they're probably like pretty close to finishing it but i i would not be surprised at all if elder scrolls seven was using large language models for their end piece no they're they're not they're i mean i'm not saying anything i'm not saying anything okay this is me speculating not you no but but there's they're just releasing the star feel good they they do one game at a time yeah and so whatever it is whenever the date is i don't know what the date is calm down mhmm but it would be i don't know like twenty twenty four twenty five twenty six so it's actually very possible that would include language models i was listening to this this talk by a gaming executive when i was in grad school and one of the questions that a person in the audience asked is why are all these games so focused on fighting and killing and the person responded that it's just so much harder to make an ai that can talk with you and cooperate with you than it is to make an ai that can fight you and i think once this technology develops further and you can have a you can reach a point where like not every single line of dialogue has to be scripted it unlocks a lot of potential for new kinds of games like much more like positive interactions that are not so focused on fighting and i'm really looking forward to that wait it might not be positive it might be just drama so you would do you'll be in the like a call of duty game and instead of doing the shooting you'll just be hanging out and like arguing with an ai about like like passive aggressive and then you won't be able to sleep that night you have to return and continue the argument mhmm that you were emotionally hurt i mean yeah i i think that's actually an exciting world whatever whatever is the drama the chaos that we love the push and pull of human connection i think it's possible to do that in the video game world and it i think you could be messier and make more mistakes in the video game world which is why it would be a nice place and and also it doesn't have a deep of a as deep of a real psychological impact because inside video games it's kinda understood that you're in a not a real world so whatever crazy stuff ai does we have some flexibility to play just like with the game of diplomacy it's a game this is not real geopolitics not real war it's a it's a game so you could you can have a little bit of fun a little bit of chaos okay back to nash equilibrium how do we find the nash equilibrium alright so there's different ways to find a nash equilibrium so the way that we do it is with this process called self play basically we have this algorithm that starts by playing totally randomly and it learns how to play the game by playing against itself so it will start playing the game totally randomly and then it you know if it's playing poker it'll eventually like get to the end of the end of the game and make fifty dollars and then it will like review all the decisions that it made along the way and say what would have happened if i had chosen this other action instead you know if i had raised here instead of called what would the other player have done and because it's playing against a copy of itself it's able to do that counterfactual reasoning so i can say okay well if i took this action and the other person takes this action and then i take this action and eventually i make a hundred fifty dollars instead of fifty and so it updates the regret value for that action regret is basically like how much does it regret having not played that action in the past and when it encounters that same situation again it's going to pick actions that have higher regret with higher probability now it'll just keep simulating the games this way it'll keep you know accumulating regrets for different situations and in the long run if you pick actions that have higher regret with higher probability in the correct way it's proven to converge to a nash equilibrium even for super complex games even for imperfect information games it's true for all games it's true for it's true for chess it's true for poker it's particularly useful for poker so this is the the method of counterfactual regret minimization this is counterfactual regret minimization that doesn't have to do with self play it has to do with just any any if you follow this kind of process self play or not you'll be able to arrive in an optimal set of actions so this counterfactual regret minimization is a kind of self play it's a principled kind of self play that's proven to converge to nash equilibria even in imperfect information games now you can have other forms of self play and people use other forms of self play and for perfect information games where you have more flexibility the algorithm doesn't have to be as theoretically sound in order to converge to to that class of games because there's it's a simpler setting sure so i kind of in in my brain the word self play has mapped in neural networks but we're speaking something bigger than just neural networks it it could be anything it it the self play mechanism is just the mechanism of a system playing itself exactly yeah self play is not tied specifically to neural nets it's it's a kind of reinforcement learning basically okay and i would also say this process of like trying to reason oh what would the value have been if i had taken this other action instead this is very similar to how humans learn to play a game like poker right like you probably played poker before and with your friends you probably ask like oh would you have called me if i raise there you know and that's that's a person trying to do the same kind of like learning from a counterfactual that the ai is doing okay and if you do that at scale you're gonna be able to learn an optimal policy yep now where the neural nets come in i said like okay if it's in that situation again then it will choose the action that has has high regret now the problem is that poker is such a huge game you know i think no limit texas hold them the version that we were playing has ten to the one hundred sixty one different decision points which is more than the number of atoms in the universe squared that's heads up that's heads up yeah ten to the one sixty one you said yeah i mean it depends on the number of chips that you have the stacks and everything but like the version that we were playing was ten to the one sixty one which i assume would be a somewhat simplified version anyway because the i bet there's some like step function you had for like bets oh no no no that's that's i'm saying like we played the the full game you can bet whatever amount you want and the thought maybe was constrained in like what it considered for bet sizes but the the person on the other side could bet whatever they wanted yeah i mean one sixty one plus or minus ten doesn't matter yeah and so the the way neural nets help out here is you know you don't have to run into the same exact situation because that's never gonna happen again the odds of you running into the same exact situation are pretty slim but if you run into a similar situation then you can generalize from other states that you've been in that kind of look like that one and you can say like well these other situations i had high regret for this action and so maybe i should play that action here as well which is the more complex game chess or poker or go or poker do you know that is a controversial question okay i'm gonna or it's like somebody screaming on reddit right now it depends on which subreddit you're on is it chess or is it poker i'm sure like david silver's gonna get really angry at me yeah i'll i'll say i'm gonna say poker actually and i think for a couple reasons they're not here to defend themselves so first of all you have the imperfect information aspect and so it's we can go into that but like once you introduce imperfect information things get much more complicated so we should say maybe you can describe what is seen to the players what is not seen in the game of texas hold'em yeah so texas hold them you get two cards face down that only you see and so that's the hidden information of the game the other players also all get two cards face down that only they see and so you have to kind of as you're playing reason about like okay what do they think i have what do they have what do they think i think they have that kind of stuff and that's that's kind of where bluffing comes into play right because the fact that you can bluff the fact that you can bet with a bad hand and still win is because they don't know what your cards are right and that's the that's the key difference between a perfect information game like poker sorry like chess and go and imperfect information games like poker this is what trash talk looks like the implied statement is the game i solved is much tougher but yeah so when you're playing i'm just gonna do random questions here so would when you're playing your opponent under imperfect information is there some degree to which you're trying to estimate the range of hands that they have or is that not part of the algorithm so how what are the different approaches to the imperfect information game so the key thing to understand about why imperfect information makes things difficult mhmm is that you have to worry not just about which actions to play but the probability that you're gonna play those actions so you think about rock paper scissors for example rock paper scissors is an imperfect information game right because you don't know what i'm about to throw i i do but yeah usually not yeah yeah and so you can't just say like oh i'm just gonna throw a rock every single time because the other person's gonna figure that out and notice a pattern and then suddenly you're gonna start losing mhmm and so you don't just have to figure out like which action to play you have to figure out the probability that you play it and really importantly the value of an action depends on the probability that you're gonna play it so if you're playing rock every single time that value is really low but if you're never playing rock you need to play rock like one percent of the time then suddenly the the other person's probably gonna be throwing scissors and when you throw a rock the value of that action is gonna be really high now you take that to poker what that means is the value of bluffing for example if you're the kind of person that never bluffs and you have this reputation as somebody that that never bluffs and suddenly you bluff there's a really good chance that that bluff is gonna work and you're gonna make a lot of money on the other hand if you got a reputation like if they've seen you play for a long time and they see oh you're the kind of person that's bluffing all the time when you bluff they're not gonna buy it and they're gonna call you down you're gonna lose a lot of money and that finding that balance of how often you should be bluffing is the key challenge of a game of poker and you contrast that with a game like chess it doesn't matter if you're opening with the queen's gambit ten percent of the time or a hundred percent of the time the value the expected value is the same so so that's that's why we need these algorithms that understand not just we have to figure out what actions are good but the probabilities we need to get the exact probabilities correct and that's actually when we created the bot libradas libradas means balanced because the algorithm that we designed was designed to find that right balance of how often it should play each action the balance of how often in the key sort of branching is the bluff or not the bluff is that is that a is that a good crude simplification of the major decision in poker it's a good simplification i think that's like the main tension but it's it's not just how often to bluff or not to bluff it's like how often should you bet in general how often should you what what kind of bet should you make should you bet big or should you bet small and with which with with which hands and so this is where the idea of a of a range comes from yeah because when you are bluffing with a particular hand in a particular spot you don't want there to be a pattern for the other person to pick up on you don't want them to figure out oh whenever this person is in this spot they're always bluffing and so you have to reason about okay would i also bet with a good hand in this spot you wanna be unpredictable so you have to think about what would i do if i had this different set of cards is there explicit estimation of like a theory of mind that the other person has about you or is that just a emergent thing that happens the way that the bots handle it the that are really successful they have an explicit theory of mind so they're explicitly reasoning about what are what's the common knowledge belief what does what do you think i have what do i think you have what do you think i think you have it's explicitly reasoning about that is there multiple use there so maybe that's jumping ahead to six players but i is there a stickiness to the person to so it's an iterative game you're playing the same person there is a there's a stickiness to that right you're gathering information as you play it's not every every every hand is in your hand is there a continuation in terms of estimating what kind of player i'm facing here that's a good question so you could approach the game that way the way that the bots do it they don't and the way that humans approach it also expert human players the way they approach it is to basically assume that you know my strategy so i'm going to try to pick a strategy where even if i were to play it for ten thousand hands and you could figure out exactly what it was you still wouldn't be able to beat it basically what that means is i'm trying to approximate the nash equilibrium i'm trying to be perfectly balanced because if if i'm playing the nash equilibrium even if you know what my strategy is like i said i'm still unbeatable in expectation so so that's what that's what the bot aims for and that's actually what a lot of expert poker players aim for as well to start by playing the nash equilibrium and then maybe if they spot weaknesses in the way you're playing then they can deviate a little bit to take advantage of that they aim to be unbeatable in expectation okay so who's the greatest poker player of all time and why is it phil hellmuth so this is for phil so he's known at least in part for maybe playing suboptimally and he still wins a lot it's a bit chaotic so maybe can you speak from an ai perspective about the genius of his madness or the madness of his genius so playing suboptimal playing chaotically as a way to make you hard to pin down about what your strategy is so okay the thing that i should explain first of all with like nash equilibrium it doesn't mean that it's predictable the whole point of it is that you're trying to be unpredictable now i think when somebody like phil hellmuth might be really successful is not in being unpredictable but in being able to take advantage of the other player and figure out where they're being predictable or guiding the other player into thinking that you have certain weaknesses and then and then understanding how they're going to change their behavior they're gonna deviate from a nash equilibrium style of play to try to take advantage of those perceived weaknesses and then counter exploit them so you kinda get into the mind games there so you think about at least has a poker as a as a dance between two agents i guess are you playing the cards or are you playing the the player so this this gets down to a big argument in the poker community and the academic community for a long time there was this debate of like what what's called gto game theory optimal poker or exploitative play and up until about like twenty seventeen when we did the libratus match i think actually exploitative play had the advantage a lot of people were saying like oh this whole idea of game theory it's just nonsense and if you really wanna make money you gotta like look into the other person's eyes and read their soul and figure out what cards they have but what happened was people started adopting the game theory optimal strategy and they were making good money and they weren't trying to adapt so much to the other player they were just trying to play the nash equilibrium and then what really solidified it i think was the the match where we played our bot against four top heads up no limit hold them poker players and the bot wasn't trying to adapt to them it wasn't trying to exploit them it wasn't trying to do these mind games it was just trying to approximate the nash equilibrium and it crushed them i think you know we were playing for fifty dollar one hundred dollar blinds and over the course of about a hundred twenty thousand hands it made close to two million dollars a hundred and twenty thousand hands a hundred twenty thousand hands against humans yeah and this was this was fake money to be clear so there was real money at stake there was two hundred thousand dollars first of all yeah all money is fake but that's a that's that's a different conversation we give it meaning it's an it's a it's it's a phenomena that gets meaning from our complex psychology as a human civilization it's emerging from the collective intelligence of the human species but that's not what you mean you mean like there's literally can't you can't buy stuff with it okay can you actually step back and take me through that competition yeah okay so when i was in grad school there was this thing called the annual computer poker competition where every year all the different research labs that were working on ai for poker would get together they would make a bot they would play them against each other and we made a bot that actually won the twenty fourteen competition the twenty sixteen competition and so we decided we're gonna take this bot build on it and play against real top professional heads up no limit texas hold'em poker players so we invited four of the world's best players in this specialty and we challenged them to a hundred twenty thousand hands of poker over the course of twenty days and we had two hundred thousand dollar two hundred thousand dollars in prize money at stake where it would basically be divided among them depending on how well they did relative to each other so we wanted to have some incentive for them to play their best did you have a confidence two thousand fourteen sixteen that this is even possible how much doubt was there so and we did a competition actually in twenty fifteen where we also played against professional poker players and the bot lost by by a pretty sizable margin actually now there were some big improvements from twenty fifteen to twenty seventeen and so can you speak to the improvements is it computational in nature is it the algorithm the the methods it was it really an algorithmic approach that that was the difference so twenty fifteen it was much more focused on trying to come up with a strategy upfront like trying to solve the entire game of poker like and then just have a lookup table where you're saying like oh i'm in this situation what's the strategy mhmm the approach that we took in twenty seventeen was much more search based it was trying to say okay well let me in real time try to compute a much better strategy than what i had precomputed by playing against myself during self play what is the search space for poker what are you searching over what's that look like there's different actions like raising calling yeah what are the actions is it just a search over actions so in a game like chess the the search is like okay i'm in this chess position and i can like you know move these different pieces and see where things end up in poker what you're searching over is the actions that you can take for your hand the probabilities that you take those actions and then also the probabilities that you take other actions with other hands that you might have right and and that's kind of like hard to wrap your head around like why are you searching over these like other hands that you might have and like trying to figure out what you would do with those hands mhmm and the idea is is again you you wanna you wanna always be balanced and unpredictable and so if your search algorithm is saying like oh i want to raise with this hand well in order to know whether that's a good action like let's say it's a bluff you know let's say you have a bad hand and you're saying like oh i i think i should be betting here with this really bad hand and bluffing well that that's only a good action if you're also betting with a strong hand otherwise it's an obvious bluff so if your action in some sense maximizes your unpredictability so that action could be mapped by your opponent to a lot of different hands then that's a good action basically what you wanna do is put your opponent into a tough spot so you want them to always have some doubt like should i call here should i fold here and if you are raising in the appropriate balance between bluffs and good hands then you're putting them into that tough spot and so that's what we're trying to do we're always trying to search for a strategy that would put the opponent into a difficult position can you give a metric that you're trying to maximize or minimize does this have to do with the regret thing what we're talking about in terms of putting your opponent in a maximally tough spot yeah ultimately what you're trying to maximize is your expected winnings like your expected value the amount of money that you're gonna walk away from assuming that your opponent was playing optimally in response so you're gonna assume that your opponent is is also playing like as as well as possible in nash equilibrium approach because if they're not then you're just gonna make more money right like anything that deviates like by definition the nash equilibrium is the strategy that does the best in expectation and so if you're deviating from that then you're just they're gonna lose money and since it's a two player zero sum game that means you're gonna make money so there's not an explicit like objective function that maximizes the toughness of the spot they're put in you're always this is not from a like a self play reinforcement learning perspective you're just trying to maximize winnings and the rest is implicit that's right yeah so we're what we're actually trying to maximize is the expected value given that the opponent is playing optimally in response to us now in practice what that ends up looking like is it's putting the opponent into difficult situations where there's no obvious decision to be made so the the system doesn't know anything about the difficulty of the situation not at all doesn't care okay yeah alright in my head it was getting excited whenever i was making the other the opponent sweat okay so you're in twenty fifteen you didn't do as well so what's the journey from that to a system that in your mind could have a chance so twenty fifteen we we got we beat beat pretty badly and we actually learned a lot from that competition and in particular you know what became clear to me is that the way the humans were approaching the game was very different from how the bot was approaching the game the bot would not be doing search it would just be trying to compute you know it would do like months of self play it would just be playing against itself for months but then when it's actually playing the game it would just act instantly and the humans when they're in a tough spot they would sit there and think for sometimes even like five minutes about whether they're gonna call or fold a hand and it became clear to me that that's there there's a good chance that that's what miss that's what's missing from our bot so i actually did some initial experiments to try to figure out how much of a difference does this actually make and the difference was huge as a signal to the human player how long you took to think no no no i'm not saying that there were any timing tells i was saying when the human like the bot would always act instantly it wouldn't try to come up with a better strategy in real time over what it had precomputed during training whereas the human like they have all this intuition about how to play but they're also in real time leveraging their ability to to think to to search to plan and coming up with an even better strategy more than what their intuition would say so you're saying that there's you're doing that's what you mean by you're doing search also yep you have an you have a intuition and search on top of that looking for a better solution yeah that's that's what i mean by search that instead of acting instantly you know a neural net usually gives you a response in like a hundred milliseconds or something it depends on the size of the of the net but if you can leverage extra computational resources you can possibly get a much better outcome and we did some experiments in small scale versions of poker and what we what we found was that if you do a little bit of search even just a little bit it was the equivalent of making your you know your precomputed strategy like you can kind of think of it as your neural net a thousand times bigger it was just a little bit of search and it just like blew away all of the research that we had been working on and trying to like scale up this like precomputed solution it was dwarfed by the benefit that we got from search can you just linger on what you mean by search here you're searching over a space of actions for your hand and for other hands how are you selecting the other hands to search over is so yeah randomly no it's all the other hands that you could have so when you're playing no limit texas hold them you've got two face down cards and so that's fifty two choose two one thousand three hundred twenty six different combinations now that's actually a little bit lower because there's face up cards in the middle and so you can eliminate those as well but you're looking at like around a thousand different possible hands that you can have and so when we're doing when the bot's doing search it's thinking explicitly there are these thousand different hands that i could have there are these thousand different hands that you could have let me try to figure out what would be a better strategy than what i've pre computed for these hands and your hands okay so that search how do you fuse that with what the neural net is telling you or what the the the the train system is telling you yeah so you kind of like the where the train system comes in is is the value at the end so there's you only look so far ahead you look like maybe you know one round ahead so if you're on the flop you're looking to the start of the turn mhmm and at that point you can use the precomputed solution to figure out what are what's the value here of like of this strategy is it of a single action essentially in that spot you're you're getting a value or is it the value of the entire series of actions well it's kind of both because you're you're trying to maximize the value for the hand that you have but in the process in order to maximize the value of the hand that you have you have to figure out what would i be doing with all these other hands as well okay but you are you in the search or was going to the end of the game no in we did so we only use search starting on the turn and then we searched all the way to the end of the game the turn the river can can we take it yeah yeah through the terminology yeah there's there's four rounds of poker so there's the preflop the flop the turn and the river and so we would start doing search halfway through the game now the first half of the game that was all precomputed it would just act instantly and then when it got to the halfway point then it would always search to the end of the game now we later improved this so it wouldn't have to search all the way to the end of the game it would actually search just a few moves ahead but that that came later and that drastically reduced the numb the amount of computational resources that we needed but the moves because you can keep betting on top of each other that's what you mean by moves so like that's where you don't just get one bet per turn of poker you can have multiple arbitrary number of bets right right i'm trying to think like i'm gonna bet and then what are you gonna do in response are you gonna raise me or are you gonna call and then if you raise what should i do so it's reasoning about that whole process up until the end of the game in the case of so for lebratus what's the the most number of reraces have you ever seen you probably cap out at like five or something because at that point you're basically all in you know i mean is there like interesting patterns like that that you've seen that the game does like you you'll have like alpha zero doing way more sacrifices than humans usually do is there something like the libratus was constantly re raising or something like that that you've noticed there was there was something really interesting that we observed with libratus so humans when they're playing poker they usually size their bets relative to the size of the pot so you know if the pot has a hundred dollars in there maybe you bet like seventy five dollars or somewhere around it somewhere between like fifty and a hundred dollars and with we gave it the option to basically bet whatever it wanted it it was actually really easy for us to say like oh if you want you can bet like ten times the pot mhmm and we didn't think it would actually do that it was just like why not give it the option and then during the competition it actually started doing this and by the way this is like a very last minute decision on our part to add this option and so we did not we we did not think the bot would would do this and i was actually kinda worried when it did start to do this like oh is this is this a problem like humans don't do this like is it screwing up but it would put the humans into really difficult spots when it would do that because you know you could imagine like you have the second best hand that's possible given the board and you're thinking like oh you're in a really great spot here and suddenly the bot bets twenty thousand dollars into a you know a thousand dollar pot and and it's basically saying like i have the best hand or i'm bluffing and you having the second best hand like now you get a really tough choice to make and so the humans would sometimes think like five or ten minutes about like what do you do should should i call should i fold and and when i saw the humans like really struggling with that decision like that's when i realized like oh actually this is maybe a good thing to do after all and of course the system is a no that it's making again like we said that it's putting them in a tough spot it's it's it's just that's part of the optimal the the game theory optimal right from the bot's perspective it's just it's just doing the thing that's going to make it the most money and the fact that it's putting the humans in a difficult spot like that's just you know a side effect of that and this was i think the the one thing i mean there were a few things that the humans walked away from but this was the the number one thing that the humans walked away from the competition saying like we need to start doing this mhmm and now these overbets what are called overbets have become really common in high level poker play have you ever talked to like somebody like daniel negrono about this he seems to be a student of the game i did actually have a conversation with daniel negroni once yeah i was i was visiting the isle of man to talk to pokerstars about ai and daniel negroni was there when we had dinner together with some other people and yeah he's he was really interested in it he mentioned that he was like you know excited about like learning from these ais so he wasn't scared he was excited he was excited and and he all he honestly he wanted to play against the bot he thought he he thought he had a decent chance of of beating it i i think he you know this is like several years ago and i think it was like not as clear to everybody that you know the ais were taking over i think now people recognize that like if you're playing against a bot there's like no chance that you have in a game like poker so consistently the bots will win the bots have heads up and in in other variants too so multi multi six player texas hold them no limit texas hold them is the bots win yeah that's the case so i think there is some debate about like is it true for every single variant of poker i think i think for every single variant of poker if somebody really put in the effort they can make an ai that would beat all humans at it we've focused on the most popular variants so heads up no limit texas hold them and then we followed it up with with six player poker as well where we managed to make a bot that beat expert human players and i think even there now it's pretty clear that humans don't stand a chance see i would love to hook up an ai system that looks at eeg like how like actually tries to optimize the toughness of the spot it puts a human in and i would i would love to see how different is that from the game theory optimal so you try to maximize the heart rate of the human player mhmm like the freaking out over a long period of time i wonder if there's going to be different strategies that emerge that are close in terms of effectiveness because it something tells me you could still be achieve superhuman level performance by just making people sweat i feel like that there's a good chance that that is the case yeah if you're able to see like that it's like a it's like a decent proxy for score right right and this is actually like the the common poker wisdom when they're talk when they're teaching players before there were bots and they were trying to teach people how to play poker they would say like the key to the game is to put your opponent to difficult spots it's a good a good estimate for if you're making the right decision so what else can you say about the fundamental role of search in poker and maybe if you can also relate it to chess and go in these games what's the role of search to solving these games yeah i think a lot of people under this is true for the general public and i think it's true for the ai community a lot of people underestimate the importance of search for these kinds of game ai results an example of this is td gammon that came out in nineteen ninety two this was the the first real instance of a neural net being used in a game ai it's a landmark achievement it was actually the inspiration for alpha zero and it used search it used two ply search to figure out its next move you got deep blue there it was very heavily focused on search looking many many moves ahead farther than any human could and that was key for why it won and then even with something like alphago i mean alphago is commonly hailed as a a landmark achievement for neural nets and it is but there's also this huge component of search monte carlo tree search to alphago that was key absolutely essential for the ai to be able to beat top humans i think a good example of this is you look at the latest versions of alpha of alphago like it was called alpha zero and there's this metric called elo rating where you can compare different humans and you can compare bots to humans now a top human player is around thirty six hundred elo maybe a little bit higher now alpha zero the strongest version is around fifty two hundred elo but if you take out the search that's being done at test time and by the way what i mean by search is the planning ahead the the thinking of like oh if i move my if i place this stone here and then he does this and then you look like five moves ahead and you see like what the board state looks like that's what i mean by search if you take out the search that's done during the game the elo rating drops to around three thousand so even today what seven years after alphago if you take out the monte carlo tree search that's being done at when playing against the human the bots are not superhuman nobody has made a raw neural net that is superhuman in go that's worth lingering on that's that's quite profound so without search that just means looking at the next move and saying this is the best move so having a function that estimates accurately what the best move is that's right without search yeah and all these bots they have the the what's called a policy network where it will tell you this is what the neural net thinks is the next best move and it it's kind of like the intuition that a human has you know the the human looks at the board and and any go or chess master will be able to tell you like oh instantly here's what i think the right move is and the bot is able to do the same thing but just like how a human grand master can make a better decision if they have more time to think when you add on this monte carlo tree search the bot is able to make a better decision yeah i mean of course a human is doing something like search in their brain but it's not i hesitate to draw a hard line but it's not like monte carlo tree search it's more like sequential language model generation so it's like a different it's a the neural network is doing the searching and i wonder what the human brain is doing in terms of searching because you're doing that like computation humanist computing they have intuition they have gut they have a really strong ability to estimate you know amongst the top players of what is good and not position without calculating all the details but they're still doing search in their head but it's a different kind of search have you ever thought about like what is the difference between the human the search that the human is performing versus what computers are doing i have thought a lot about that and i think it's a really important question so the ai in alpha and alpha's in alpha go or any of these go ais they're all doing monte carlo tree search which is a particular kind of search and it it's actually a a symbolic tabular search it uses the neural net to guide its search but it isn't actually like full full on neural net now that kind of search is very successful in these kinds of like perfect information board games like chess and go but if you take it to a game like poker for example it doesn't work it it can't it can't understand the concept of hidden information it doesn't understand the balance that you have to strike between like the amount that you're raising versus the amount that you're calling and in every one of these games you see a different kind of search and the human brain is able to plan for all these different games in a very general way now i think that's one thing that we're we're missing from ai today and i think it's a really important missing piece the ability to plan and reason more generally across a wide variety of different settings in a way where the general reasoning makes you better at each one of the games yeah not worse yeah so you can kind of think of it as like neural nets today they'll give you an like transformers for example are super general but you know they'll give you it'll it'll output an answer in like a hundred milliseconds and if you tell it like oh you got five minutes to give you a decision you know feel free to take more time to make a better decision it's not gonna know what to do with that but a human if you're playing a game like chess they're gonna give you a very different answer depending on if you say oh you got a hundred milliseconds or you've got five minutes yeah there i mean there'll be people who have started using the right transformers language models like the in an iterative way that does improve the answer or like showing the work kind of kind of idea yeah they got this thing called chain of thought reasoning mhmm and that's i think super promising right yeah i think and i think it's a good step in in the right direction i i would kind of like say it's similar to monte carlo rollouts in in a game like chess there's a kind of search that you can do where you're saying like i'm gonna roll out my intuition and see like without really thinking you know what are the better decisions i can make farther down the path what would i do if i just acted according to intuition for the next ten moves and that gets you an improvement but i think that there's much much richer kinds of of planning that we could do so when labradas actually beat the poker players what what did that feel like what was that i mean actually on that day what were you feeling like were you were you nervous i mean poker was one of the games that you thought like is not gonna be solvable because it's the human factor so at least in the narratives we tell ourselves the human factor is so fundamental to the game of poker yeah the libratus competition was super stressful for me also i mean i was working on this like basically continuously for a year leading up to the competition i mean for me it became like very clear like okay this is the search technique this is the approach that we need and then i spent a year working on this pretty much like nonstop oh can we actually get into details like what programming language is is it written in what's some interesting implementation details that are like fun slash painful yeah so one of the interesting things about labradas is that we had no idea what the bar was to actually beat top humans yeah we could play against like our prior bots and that kinda gives us some sense of like are we making progress are we going in the right direction but we had no idea like what the bar actually was and so we threw a huge amount of resources at trying to make the strongest bot possible mhmm so we used c plus plus it was paralyzed we were using i think like a thousand cpus maybe maybe more actually and you know today that sounds like nothing but for a grad student back in twenty sixteen that was a huge amount of resources well it's still a lot for even any grad student today yeah it's still tough to to get or even to to allow yourself to think in that in terms of scale at cmu at mit anything like that yeah and you know talking about terabytes of memory so it was a very paralyzed and it had to be very fast too because the more games that you could simulate the stronger the bot would be so is there some like john carmack style like efficiencies you had to come up with like an efficient way to represent a hand all that kind of stuff there were all all sorts of optimizations that i had to make to try to get this thing to run as fast as possible they were like how do you minimize the latency how do you like you know package things together so that like you minimize the amount of communication between the different nodes how do you like optimize the algorithms so that you can you know try to squeeze out more and more from the game that you're actually playing all all these kinds of different decisions that that i you know had to make just a fun question what what id did you use what for for c plus plus the time i think i used visual studio actually yeah okay yeah is that still carried through to today versus code is is what i use today it seems like it's pretty tough community basically conversion on okay cool so you got you got this super optimized c plus plus system and then you show up to the day of competition yeah humans versus machine how did it feel throughout the day super stressful i mean i thought going into it that we had like a fifty fifty chance because basically i thought if if they play in a totally normal style i think we'll squeak out a win but there's always a chance that they can find some weakness in the bot mhmm and if they do and we're we're playing like for twenty days a hundred twenty thousand hands of poker they have a lot of time to find weaknesses in the system and if they do we're gonna get crushed and that's actually what happened in the previous competition the humans you know they started out it wasn't like they were winning from the start but then they found these weaknesses that they could take advantage of and for the next i don't know like ten days they were just just crushing the bot stealing money from it what were the weaknesses they found like maybe over betting was effective that kind of stuff so certain betting strategies worked what they found is yeah over betting like betting certain amounts the bot would have a lot trouble dealing with those sizes yeah and then also when it the bot got into really difficult all in situations it it wasn't able to because it wasn't doing search it had to clump different hands together and it wouldn't it would treat them identically yeah and so it wouldn't be able to distinguish you know like having a king high flush versus an ace high flush and in some situations that really matters a lot and so they could put the bot into those situations and then the bot would would just bleed money clever humans yeah okay so i didn't realize it was over twenty days so what were the humans like over those twenty days and what was the bot like so we had set up the competition you know like i said there was two hundred thousand dollars in prize money and they would get paid a fraction of that depending on how well they did relative to each other yeah so i was kinda hoping that they wouldn't work together to try to find weaknesses in the bot but they enter the competition with their like number one objective being to beat the bot and they didn't care about like individual glory they were like we're all gonna work as a team to try to take down the spot yeah and so they immediately started comparing notes what they would do is they would coordinate looking at different parts of the strategy to try to try to you know find out weaknesses and then at the end of the day we actually sent them a log of all the hands that were played and what cards the bot had on each of those hands oh wow yeah that's that's gutsy yeah it was honestly and i'm not sure why we did that in retrospect but i mean i'm glad we did it because we ended up winning anyway but that if if you've ever played poker before like that is golden information i mean to know usually when you play poker you see about a third of the hands to showdown mhmm and to just hand them all the cards that the bot had on every single hand that was just just a gold mine for them yeah and so then they would review the hands and try to see like okay could they find patterns in the bot the weaknesses and could they then then they would coordinate and study together and try to figure out okay now this person's gonna explore this part of the strategy for weaknesses this person's gonna explore this part of the strategy for weaknesses it's a kind of psychological warfare showing in the hands yeah i mean i'm sure you didn't think of it that way but like doing that means you're confident in the the possibility to win well that's that's one way of putting it i wasn't super confident yeah so you know going in like i said i think i had like fifty fifty odds on us winning the when we actually when we announced the competition the poker community decided to gamble on who would win mhmm and their initial odds against us were like four to one they they were really convinced that the humans were gonna pull out a win mhmm the bot ended up winning for three days straight and even then after three days the betting odds were still just fifty fifty and then at that point it started to look like the humans were coming back they started to like you know but but poker is a very high variance game and i think what happened is like they thought that they spotted some weaknesses that weren't actually there mhmm and then around day eight it was just very clear that they were getting absolutely crushed and and from that point i mean for for a while there i was super stressed out thinking like oh my god the humans are coming back and we're just they've found weaknesses and now we're just gonna lose the whole thing but no it it ended up going in the other direction and the bot ended up like crushing them in the long run how did it feel at the end like as a human being what it as a person who loves appreciates the beauty of the game of poker and as a person who appreciates the beauty of ai is there did you feel a certain kind of way about it i felt a lot of lot of things man i mean at that point in my life i had spent five years working on this project and it was a huge sense of accomplishment i mean to spend five years working on something and finally see it succeed yeah i wouldn't trade that for anything in the world yeah because it's a that's a real benchmark it's not like getting a some percent accuracy on a dataset this is like real this is real world yeah it's it's just a game but it's also a game that means a lot to a lot of people and this is humans doing their best to beat the machine so this is a real benchmark unlike anything else yeah and i mean this is this is what i had been dreaming about since i was like sixteen playing poker you know with my friends in high school the idea that you could find a strategy you know approximate the nash equilibrium be able to beat all the poker players in the world with it you know so to actually see that come to fruition and and be realized that was it's kinda magical yeah especially money is on the line too it's a different it's different than chess and that aspect like people get that's why you wanna look at betting marcus if you want to actually understand what people really think and in the same sense poker it's really high stakes because it's money and to solve that game that's that's an amazing accomplishment so the leap from that to multi way six player poker what's how difficult is that jump and what are some interesting differences between heads up poker and and multi way poker yeah so i mentioned you know nash equilibrium in two player zero sum games if you play that strategy you are guaranteed to not lose an expectation no matter what your opponent does now once you go to six player poker you're no longer playing a two player zero sum game and so there was a lot of debate among the academic community and among the poker community about how well these techniques would extend beyond just two player heads up poker now what i had come to realize is that the techniques actually i thought really would extend to six player poker because even though in theory they don't give you these guarantees outside of two player zero sum games in practice it still gives you a really strong strategy now there were a lot of complications that would come up with six player poker besides like the game theoretic aspect i mean for one the game is just exponentially larger so the main thing that allowed us to go from two player to six player was the idea of depth limited search so i said before like you know we would do search we would plan out the bot would plan out like what what it's going to do next and for the next several moves and in labradas that search was done extending all the way to the end of the game so we'd have to start it it from from the turn onwards like looking maybe ten moves ahead it would have to figure out what it was doing for all those moves now when you get to six player poker it can't do that exhaustive search anymore because the game is just way too large but by only having to look a few moves ahead and then stopping there and substituting a value estimate of like how good is that strategy at that point then we're able to do a much more scalable form of search is there something cool we're looking at the paper right now is there something cool in the paper in terms of graphics a game tree traversal via monte carlo i think if you go down a bit figure one an example of equilibrium selection problem oh so yeah what do we know about equilibrium when there's multiple players so when you go outside of two players you're a sum so nash equilibrium is a set of strategies like one strategy for each player where no player has an incentive to switch to a different strategy and so you can kind of think of it as like imagine you have a game where there's a a ring that's actually the visual here you got a ring and the object of the game is to be as far away from the other players as possible there's an a nash equilibrium is for all the players to be spaced equally apart around this ring but there's infinitely many different nash equilibria right there's infinitely many ways to space four dots along a ring and if every single player independently computes a nash equilibrium then there's no guarantee that the joint strategy that they're all playing is going to result is going to be an s equilibrium they're they're just gonna be like random dots scattered along this ring rather than four coordinated dots being equally spaced apart is it possible to sort of optimally do this kind of selection to do the the selection about of the equilibrium you're chasing so is there like a meta problem to be solved here so the meta problem is in some sense how do you how do you understand the nash equilibria that the other players are going to play and and even if you do that again like there's no guarantee that you're going to win so you know if you're playing if you're playing risk like i said and and all the other players decide to team up against you you're gonna lose nash equilibrium doesn't help you there and so there is this big debate about whether nash equilibrium and all these techniques that compute it are even useful once you go outside of two player zero some games now i think for many games there is a valid criticism here and i think when we talk about when we go to something like diplomacy we run into this issue that the approach of trying to approximate a nash equilibrium doesn't really work anymore but it turns out that in six player poker because six player poker is such an adversarial game where none of the players really try to work with each other the techniques that were used into player poker to try to approximate an equilibrium those still end up working in practice in in six player poker as well there there's some deep way in which six player poker is just a bunch of heads up poker like games in one it's like a it's like embedded in it so the competitiveness is more fundamental to poker than the cooperation right yeah poker is just such an adversarial game there's no real cooperation in fact you're not even allowed to cooperate in poker it's considered collusion it's against the rules and so for that reason the techniques end up working really well and i think that's true more more broadly in extremely adversarial games in general but that's sort of in practice versus being able to prove something that's right nobody has a proof that that's the case and it could be that that six player poker belongs to some class of games where approximating an nash equilibrium through self play provably works well and you know there are other classes of games beyond just two player zero sum where this is proven to work well so there are these you know kinds of games called potential games which i won't go into it's kind of like a complicated concept but there are classes of games where this approach to approximating an nash equilibrium is proven to work well now six player poker is not known to belong to one of those classes but it is possible that there is some classic games where it either provably performs well or provably performs not that badly so what are some interesting things about pluribus that was able to achieve human level performance on this or superhuman level performance on the six player version of poker i personally i think the most interesting interesting thing about pluribus is that it was so much cheaper than lebratus i mean lebratus if you had to put a price tag on on the computational resources that went into it i would say the final training run took about a hundred thousand dollars you go to pluribus the final training run would cost like less than a hundred fifty dollars on aws is this normalized to computational inflation so meaning does is is this just does this just have to do with the fact that pluribus was trained like a year later no no no it's not it's i mean first of all like yeah computing resources are are getting cheaper every day and like but you're not gonna see a a thousand fold decrease in so it does depth limited search also work for libratus so it does depth limited search also work for libratus yep yes so where this depth limited search came from is you know i i developed this technique and ran it on two player poker first and that reduced the computational resources needed to make an ai that was superhuman from you know a hundred thousand dollars for the broadus to something you could train on your laptop what do you learn from that from that discovery what i would take away from that is that algorithmic improvements really do matter how would you describe the more general case of limited dev search so it's basically constraining the scale temporal or in some other way of the computation you're doing in some clever way so like with like how else can you significantly constrain computation right well i think the idea is that we want to be able to leverage search as much as possible and the way that we were doing it in libratus required us to search all the way to the end of the game now if you're playing a game like chess the idea that you're gonna search always to the end of the game is kinda unimaginable right like there's just so many situations where you just won't be able to use search in that case or the cost would be you know prohibitive and this technique allowed us to leverage search and without having to pay such a huge computational cost for it and be able to apply it more broadly so to what degree did you use neural nets for libratus and pluribus and more generally what role do neural nets have to play in in superhuman level performance in poker so we actually did not use neural nets at all for libradas or pluribus and a lot of people found this surprising back in twenty seventeen i think they found it surprising today that we were able to do this without using any neural nets and i think the reason for that i mean i think neural nets are incredibly powerful and the techniques that are used today even for poker ais do rely quite heavily on neural nets but it wasn't the main challenge for for poker like i think what neural nets are really good for if you're in a situation where finding features for a value function is really difficult then neural nets are really powerful and this was the problem in go right like the problem in go was that or the final problem in go at least was that nobody had a good way of looking at a board and figuring out who was winning or and describing through a simple algorithm who was winning or losing and so their neural nets were super helpful because you could just feed in a ton of different board positions into this neural net and it would be able to predict then who was winning or losing but in poker the features weren't the challenge the the challenge was how do you design a scalable algorithm that would allow you to find this balanced strategy that would understand that you have to bluff with the right probability so can that be somehow incorporated into the the value function this the complexity of poker that you've described yeah so the way the value functions work in poker like the latest and greatest poker ais they do use neural nets for the value function the way it's done is is very different from how it's done in a game like chess or go because in poker you have to reason about beliefs and so the value of a state depends on the beliefs that players have about what the different cards are like if you have pocket aces then whether that's a really really good hand or just an okay hand depends on whether you know i have pocket aces right like if you know that i have pocket aces then if i bet you're gonna fold immediately but if you think that i have a really bad hand then i could bet with pocket aces and make a ton of money so the value function in poker these days takes the beliefs as an input which is very different from like how how chess and go ais work so as a person who appreciates the game who do you think is the greatest poker player of all time that's a that's a tough question can ai help answer that question can you can can you actually analyze the quality of play right so the chess engines can can give estimates of the quality of play right i wonder if there's a is there an elo rating type of system for poker i suppose you could but there's just not enough you would have to play a lot of games right a very large number of games like more than you would in chess the determinacy game makes it easier to estimate elo i think i think it is much harder to estimate something like elo rating in poker i think it's doable the problem is that the the game is very high variance so you could play you could be profitable in poker for a year and you could actually be a bad player just because the variance is so high i mean you've got top professional poker players that would lose for a year just because they're on a really bad bad streak yeah so for elo you have to have a nice clean way of saying if player a played player b and a beats b that says something that's a signal in poker it's a very noisy signal it's a very noisy signal now there is a signal there and so you you could do this this calculation it would just be much harder but the same way that ais have now taken over chess and you know all the top professional chess players train with with ais the same is true for poker the game has become a very computational people train with ais to try to find out where they're making mistakes try to learn from the ais to improve their strategy so now yeah so the game has been revolutionized this this in the past five years by by the development of ai in this sport the skill with which you avoided the question of the greatest of all time was impressive so my feeling is that it's a difficult it's a difficult question because just like in chess where you can't really compare magnus carlsen today to garry kasparov because the game has evolved so much the poker players today are so far beyond the the the skills of like people that were playing even ten or twenty years ago so you look at the the kinds of like all stars that were on espn at like the height of the poker boom pretty much all those players are actually not that good at the game today at at least at least the the strategy aspect i mean there might be still be good at like like reading the player at the other side of the table and trying to figure out like are they bluffing or not but in terms of the actual like computational strategy of the game a lot of them have really struggled to keep up with that development now so for that reason i'll i'll give an answer and i'm gonna say daniel negraneo who you actually had on the podcast recently i saw it was a great episode gonna love this so much and and phil's gonna hate this so much and i'm i'm gonna give him i'm gonna give him credit because he is one of the few like old school really strong players that have kept up with the development of ai so he is trying to he's constantly studying the the game theory optimal way of playing exactly yeah and i think a lot of a lot of the old school poker players are just kinda given up on that aspect and and i gotta give daniel negroniou credit for for keeping up with all the developments that are happening in the sport yeah it's fascinating to watch it's fascinating to watch where it's headed yeah so there you go some love for daniel quick pause bathroom break yeah let's do it let's go from poker to diplomacy what is at at a high level the game of diplomacy yeah so i talked a lot about two player zero sum games and what's interesting about diplomacy is that it's very different from these like adversarial games like chess go poker even starcraft and dota diplomacy has a much bigger cooperative element to it it's a seven player game it was actually created in the fifties and it takes place before world war one it's like a map of europe with seven great powers and they're all trying to form alliances with each other there's a lot of negotiation going on and so the whole focus of the game is on forming alliances with the other players to take on the other players england germany russia turkey austria hungary italy and france that's right yeah so the way the game works is on each turn you're spend about you know five to fifteen minutes talking to the other players in privates and you make all sorts of deals with them you say like hey let's work together you know let's team up against this other player because the only way that you can make progress is by working with somebody else against the others and then after that negotiation period is done all the players simultaneously submit their moves and they're all executed at the same time and so you can tell people like hey i'm gonna support you this turn but then you don't follow through with it and they're only gonna figure that out once they see the moves being read off how much of it is natural language like written actual text how much is like you're actually saying phrases that are structured so there's different ways to play the game you know you can play it in person and in that case it's all natural language free form communication there's no constraints on the kinds of deals that you can make the kinds of things that you can discuss you can also play it online so you can you know send long emails back and forth you can play it like live online or over voice chat but the the focus the the important thing to understand is that this is unstructured communication you can say whatever you want you can make any sorts of deals that you want and everything is done privately so it's not like you're all around the board together having a conversation you're grabbing somebody going off into a corner and conspiring behind everybody else's back about what you're planning and there's no limit in theory to the conversation you can have directly with one person that's right you can make all sorts of you could talk about anything you could say like hey let's have a long term alliance against this guy you can say like hey can you support me this turn in in return i'll do this other thing for you next turn or you know yeah just you can talk about like what you talked about with somebody else and gossip about like what they're planning the way that i would describe the game is that it's kind of like a mix between risk poker and the tv show survivor there's like this big element of like trying to yeah there's a there's a big social element and and the best way that i would describe the game is that it's really a game about people rather than the pieces so risk because it is a map it's kind of war game like poker because there's a game theory component that's very kinda strategic so you could convert it into an artificial intelligence problem and then survive it because of the social component that's right strong social component i saw that somebody said online that the internet version of the of the game has this quality of that it's easier to almost to do like role playing as opposed to being yourself you can actually like be the like really imagine yourself as the leader of france or russia and so on like really pretend to be that person it's actually fun to really lean into being that that leader yeah so some some players do go this route where they just like kind of view it as a strategy game but also a role playing game where they can like act out like what would i be like if i was you know a leader of france in nineteen hundred oh forfeit right away no i'm just kidding and they sometimes use like the old timey language to like or how they imagine the elites would talk at that time anyway so the what are the different turns of the game like what are the rounds yeah so on on every turn you've got like a bunch of different units that you start out with so you start out controlling like just a few units and the object of the game is to gain control of the majority of the map if you're able if you're able to do that then you've won the game but like i said the only way that you're able to do that is by working with other players so on every turn you can issue a move order so for each of your units you can move them to an adjacent territory or you can keep them where they are or you can support a move or hold of a different unit so what are the territories well how how's the map divided up it's kind of like risk where the the map is divided up into like fifty different territories now you can enter a territory if you're moving into that territory with more supports than the person that's in there or the person that's trying to move in there so if you're moving in and there's somebody already there then if neither of you have support it's a one versus one and you'll bounce back and neither of you will make progress if you have a unit that's supporting that move into the territory then it's a two versus one and you'll kick them out and they'll have to retreat somewhere what does support mean support is like it's a it's an action that you can issue in the game so you can say this unit you you write down this unit is supporting this other unit into this territory are are these units from opposing forces they could be they could be and this is this is where the interesting aspect of the game comes in because you can support your own units into territory but you can also support other people's units into territories and so that's what the negotiations really revolve around but you don't have to do the thing you say you're going to do right yeah and so there's can say i'm gonna support you but then backstab the person yep that's absolutely right and that tension is is core to the game that tension is absolutely core to the game the the fact that you can make all sorts of promises but you have to reason about the fact that like hey they might not trust you if you say you're gonna do something or they might be lying to you when they say they're gonna support you so maybe just just to jump back what's what's the history of the game in general is it true that henry kissinger loved the game and jfk and all those i've heard like a bunch of different people that or is that just one of those things that the cool kids say they they do but they don't actually play so the game was created in the fifties yeah and from what i understand it it was jfk's it was played in like the jfk white house henry kissinger's favorite game i don't know if it's true but that's definitely what i've heard it's interesting that they went with world war one when it was created after world war two so the story that i've heard for the creation of the game is it was created by somebody that had looked at the history of the twentieth century and they saw world war one as a failure of diplomacy so sure yeah you know they saw the fact that this war broke out as like the the diplomats of all these countries like really failed to prevent a war and he wanted to create a game that would basically teach people about diplomacy and it it's really fascinating that like in his ideal version of the game of diplomacy nobody actually wins the game because the whole point is that if somebody is about to win then the other players should be able to work together to stop that person from winning and so the ideal version of the game is just one where where nobody actually wins and you know it kinda has a nice like wholesome take home message then that you know war war is ultimately futile and and that optimal that feudal optimal could be achieved through great diplomacy yep so is there some asymmetry in in terms of which is more powerful russia versus germany versus france and so on so i think the general consensus is that france is the strongest power in the game but okay the beautiful thing about diplomacy is that it's it's self balancing right so the the fact that france has an inherited advantage from the beginning means that the other players are less likely to work with it i saw that russia has four units for or four of something that the others have three of something that's true yeah so russia starts off with four units while all the other players start with three but russia is also in a much more vulnerable position because they have to like they have a lot more neighbors as well got it larger territory more yeah right more border to defend okay what else is what else is important to know about the rules so there there's how many rounds are there like is this iterative game is there is it is it finite do you just keep going indefinitely usually the game lasts i would say about fifteen or twenty turns there's in theory no limit it could last longer but at some point i mean if you're playing a house game with friends at some point you just get tired and you all agree like okay we're gonna end the game here and call it a draw if you're playing online there's usually like set limits on when the game will actually end and what's the end what's the termination condition like does the the does one country have to conquer everything else so if somebody is able to actually gain control of majority of the map then then they've won the game and that is a a solo victory as it's called now that pretty rarely happens especially with strong players because like i said the game is designed to incentivize the other players to put a stop to that and all work together to to stop the superpower usually what ends up happening is that you know all the players agree to a draw and then the the score the the win is divided among the the remaining players there's a lot of different scoring systems the one that we used in our research basically gives a score relative to how much control you have of the map so the more that you control the higher you score what's the history of using this game as a benchmark for ai research do do people use it yeah so people have been working on ai for diplomacy since about the eighties there was some really exciting research back then but the approach that was taken was very different from what we see today i mean the research in the eighties was a very rule based approach kind of kind of a heuristic approach it was very in line with the kind of research that was being done in the eighties you know basically trying to encode human knowledge into the strategy of the ai sure and you know it's understandable i mean the game is so incredibly different and so so much more complicated than the kinds of games that people were working on like chess and go and poker that it it was honestly even hard to like start getting making any progress in in in diplomacy can you just formulate what is the problem from an ai perspective and why is it hard why is it a challenging game to solve so there's a lot of aspects in diplomacy that make it a huge challenge first of all you have the natural language components and i think this really is what makes it arguably the most difficult game among like the major benchmarks the fact that you have to it it's not about moving pieces on the board your action space is basically all the different sentences that you could communicate to somebody else in this game yeah and is there can we just like link on that so is part of it like the ambiguity in the language if if it was like very strict if you narrow the set of possible sentences you could do would that simplify the game significantly the the real difficulty is the breadth of things that you can talk about mhmm you could have natural language in other games like settlers of catan for example like you could have a natural language settlers of catan ai but the things that you're gonna talk about are basically like am i trading you two sheep for a wood or three sheep for a wood whereas in a game like diplomacy the breadth of conversations that you're going to have are like you know am i going to support you are you gonna support me in return which units are are gonna do what what did this other person sit promise you they're lying because they told this other person that they're gonna do this instead if you help me out this turn then in the future i'll do these things that will help you out the the depth and breadth of these conversations is is really complicated and it's all being done in natural language now you could approach it and we actually consider doing this like you you know having a a simplified language to make this complexity smaller but ultimately we thought the most impactful way of doing this research would be to head address the natural language component head on and and just try to go for the full game up front just looking at sample games and what the conversations look like greetings england this should prove to be a fun game since all the private press is going to be made public at the end at the least it will be interesting to see if the press changes because of that anyway good okay so there there's like yeah that's just kinda like the generic greetings at the beginning of the game meet comes a little bit later when you're starting to talk about like specific strategy and stuff i agree there are a lot of advantages to the two of us keeping in touch and our nations make strong natural allies in the middle game so that kind of stuff making friends making enemies yeah or like if you look at the next line so the person saying like i've heard bits about a lepanto and an octopus opening and basically telling austria like hey just a heads up you know i've heard these whispers about like what might be going on behind your back yeah so but so there's all kinds of complexities in that in the in the language of that right like to interpret what the what the heck that means it's hard for us humans but for ai it's even harder you have to understand like at every level the the semantics of that right i mean there's the there's the complexity in understanding when somebody is saying this to me what does that mean then there's also the complexity of like should i be telling this person this like i've overheard these these whispers should i be telling this person that like hey you might be getting attacked by by this other power okay so what how we're supposed to think about okay so that's the natural language how how do you even begin trying to solve this game it seems like it seems like the taurine test on steroids yeah and i mean there's there's the natural language and then even besides the natural language aspect you also have the the cooperative elements of the game and i think this is actually something that i find really interesting if you look at all of the previous game ai breakthroughs they've all happened in these purely adversarial games where you don't actually need to understand how humans play the game it's all just ai versus ai right like you look at checkers chess go poker starcraft dota two like in some of those cases they leveraged human data but they never needed to they were always just trying to have a scalable algorithm that then they could throw a lot of computational resources at a lot of memory at and then eventually it would converge to an approximation of a nash equilibrium this perfect strategy that in a two player zero sum game guarantees that they're going to be able to not lose to any opponent so you can't leverage self play to solve this game you you can leverage self play but it's no longer sufficient to beat humans so how do you integrate the human into the loop of this so what you have to do is incorporate human data and to kinda give you some intuition for why this is the case like imagine you're playing a negotiation game like like diplomacy but you're training completely from scratch without any human data the the ai is not going to suddenly like figure out how to communicate in english it's going to figure out some weird robot language that only it will understand yeah and then when you stick that in a game with six other humans they're gonna think this person's talking gibberish and they're just gonna ally with each other and team up against the bot or not even team up against the bot but just not work with the bot and so in order to be able to play this game with humans it has to understand the human way of playing the game not this machine way of playing the game yeah yeah that's fascinating so right that that that's a that's a nuanced thing to understand because the a chess playing program doesn't need to play like a human to beat a human exactly but here you have to play like a human in order to beat them or at least you have to understand how humans play the game so that you can understand how to work with them if they have certain expectations about what does it mean to be a good ally what does it mean to have like a a reciprocal relationship where we're working together you have to abide by those conventions and if you don't they're just gonna work with somebody else instead do you think of this as a a clean in some deep sense of the spirit of the turing test as formulated by alan turing is is it in some sense this is what the turing test actually looks like so because of open ended natural language conversation seems like very difficult to evaluate like here at a high stakes where humans are trying to win a game that seems like how you actually perform the turing test i think it's different from the turing test like the way that the turing test is formulated it's about trying to distinguish a human from a machine and seeing oh could the machine successfully pass as a human in this adversarial setting where the a where the player is trying to figure out whether it's a machine or a human whereas in diplomacy it's not about trying to figure out whether this player is a human or a machine it's ultimately about whether i can work with this player regardless of whether they are a human or a machine and can the machine do that better than a human can yeah i'm gonna just to think about that but that just feels like the implied requirement for that is for the machine to be human like i think that's i think that's true that if you're going to play in this human game you have to somehow adapt to the to the human surroundings and the human play style and to win you have to adapt so you can't if you're the outsider if you're not human like i feel like that's a losing strategy i think that's i think that's correct yeah yeah so okay what what are the complexities here what was your approach to it before i get to that one thing i should explain like why we decided to work on diplomacy yeah so basically what happened is in twenty nineteen i was wrapping up the work on six player poker on pluribus and was trying to think about what to work on next and i had been seeing like all these other breakthroughs happening in ai i mean like twenty nineteen you have starcraft you have alphastar beating humans in starcraft you've got the dota two stuff happening at openai you have gpt two or gpt three come i think it was gpt two at the time mhmm and it became clear that ai was progressing really really rapidly and people were throwing out these like other games about you know what should be the next challenge for for multi agent ai and i just felt like we had to aim bigger if you look at a game like chess or a game like go they took decades for researchers to to ultimately reach superhuman performance at i mean like chess took four years of ai research go took another twenty years and we we thought that diplomacy would be this incredibly difficult challenge that could easily take a decade to to make an ai that could play competently but we felt like that was that was a goal worth aiming for and so honestly i was kind of reluctant to work on it at first because i i thought it was like too far out of the realm of possibility but you know i was talking to a coworker of mine adam lerer and he was basically saying like why not aim for it you know we'll learn some interesting things along the way and maybe it'll be possible and so so we decided to go for it and i i think i think it was the right choice considering just how much progress there there was in ai and that that progress has continued in the years since so winning a diplomacy what does that really look like it means talking to six other players six other entities agents and convincing and convincing them of stuff that you want them to be convinced of like what what exactly i'm trying to get like to deeply understand what the problem is ultimately the problem is is simple to to quantify right like you're going to play this game with humans and you want your score on average to be as high as possible you know if you can say like i am winning more than any any human alive then you're a champion diplomacy player now ultimately we haven't we didn't reach that we got to human level performance we actually so we played about forty games with with real humans online the bot came in second out of all players that played five or more games and so not like number one but way way higher than what what was the expertise level are they beginners are they intermediate players advanced players do you have a sense that's a great question and so i think this kinda goes into how do you measure the performance in diplomacy and i would argue that when you're measuring performance in a game like this you don't actually want to measure it in games with all expert players it's kinda like if you're developing a self driving car you don't want to measure that car on the road with a bunch of expert stunt drivers yeah you want to put it on a road of like an actual american city and see is this car crashing less often than an expert driver would yeah so so that's the metric that we've used we we're saying like we're gonna stick this game we're gonna stick this bot in games with a wide variety of skill levels and then are we doing better than a strong or expert human player would in the same situation that that's quite brilliant because i played a lot of sports in my life like as a tennis judo whatever and it's somehow almost easier to go against experts almost always i don't i don't know i i think they're more predictable in the quality of play the the space of strategies you operate under is narrower against experts it's more fun it's really frustrating to go against beginners also because beginners talk trash to you when they somehow do beat you so that's a human thing that they had they tend to be worried about that but yeah the variance in strategies right is is greater especially with natural language it's just all over the place then true yeah and and honestly when you look at what makes a good human diplomacy player obviously they're able to handle themselves in games with other expert humans but where they really shine is when they're playing with these weak players and they know how to take advantage of the fact that they're a weak player that they won't be able to like pull off a stab as well or that they have certain tendencies and they can take them under their wing and persuade them to do things that might not even be in their interest the really good diplomacy players are are able to to take advantage of the fact that there that there are some weak players in the game okay so if you have to incorporate human play data how how do you do that how do you do that in order to to train an ai system to play diplomacy yeah so that's that's really the the crux of the problem how do we leverage the benefits of self play that have been so successful in all these other previous games while keeping the strategy as as human compatible as possible and so what we did is we first trained a a language model and then we made that language model controllable on a set of in a a set of intents what we what we call intents which are basically like an action that we want to play and an action that we would like the other player to play and so this gives us a way to generate dialogue that's not just trying to imitate the human style whatever a human would say in the situation but to actually give it a a a an intent a purpose in its communication we can talk about a specific move or we can make a specific request and the determination of what that move is that we're discussing comes from strategic re a strategic reasoning model that uses reinforcement learning and planning so the computing the intents for all the players how's that done just so as a starting point is that with reinforcement learning or is that just optimal determining what the optimal is for intents it's a combination of reinforcement learning and planning actually very similar to how you approach how we approached poker and how people approached like chess and go as well we're using self play and and search to try to figure out what are what is an optimal move for us and what is a desirable move that we would like this other player to play now the the difference between the way that we approached reinforcement learning and search in this game versus those previous games is that we have to keep it human compatible we have to understand how the other person is likely to play rather than just assuming that they're gonna play like a machine and how language gets them to play in a way that maximize the chance of following the intent you want them to follow okay how do you how do you do that how do you how do you connect language to intent so the way that rl and and planning is done is actually not using language so we're we're coming up with this like plan for the action that we're gonna play and the other person's gonna play and then we feed that action into the dialogue model that will then send a message according to those plans so the language model there is mapping action to to message to message one word at a time basically one message at a time so we'll we'll feed into the dialogue model like here are the actions that you should be discussing here's the message here's like the the content of the message that we would like you to send and then it will actually generate a message that corresponds to that okay does this actually work it works surprisingly well okay how oh man the the number of ways it probably goes horribly i would have imagined it goes horribly wrong so how the heck is it effective at all i mean there are a lot of ways that this could fail so for example i mean you could have a situation where you're you're basically like we don't tell the the language model like here are the pieces of our action or the other person's action that you should be communicating mhmm and so like let's say you're about to attack somebody you probably don't wanna tell them that you're going to attack them mhmm but there's nothing in the language like the language model is not very smart at the end of the day so it doesn't really have a way of knowing like well what should i be talking about should i tell this person i'm about to attack them or not so we have to like develop a lot of other techniques that that deal with that like one of the things we do for example is we try to calculate if i'm going to send this message what would i expect the other person to do in response so if it's a message like hey i'm gonna attack you this turn they're probably gonna you know attack us or or defend against that attack and so we have a way of recognizing like hey sending this message is a negative expected value action and we should not send this message so yes for for particular kinds of messages you have like an extra function that does the estimates the value of that message yeah so we have these kinds of filters that like so it's a filter so there's a there's a good and is that filter in your network or is it rule based that's that's a that's a neural network so we're well it's a it's a combination it's a neural network but it's also using planning it's trying to compute like what is the policy that the other players are going to play given that this message has been sent and then is that better than not sending the message or not or i feel like that's how my brain works too like there's a language model that generates random crap and then there's these other neural nets that are essentially filters at least that's when i tweet i'll i'll usually my process of tweeting i'll think of something and it's hilarious to me and then about five seconds later the the filter network comes in and says no no that's not funny at all that i mean there's some something interesting to that kind of process so you have a set of actions that you you want you have an intent that you want to achieve an intent that you want your opponent to achieve then you generate messages and then you evaluate if those messages will achieve the the the the goal you want yeah and we're we're filtering for several things we're filtering like is this a a sensible message you know so sometimes language models will send will generate messages that are just like totally nonsense and we try to filter those out we also try to filter out messages that that are basically lies so you know diplomacy has this reputation as a game that's really about deception and lying mhmm but we try to actually minimize the amount that the bot would lie this was actually mostly a or are you no i'm just kidding right i mean like part of the reason for this is that we actually found that lying would make the bot perform worse in the long run it would end up with a lower score because once the bot lies people would never trust it again and and trust is a huge aspect of the game of diplomacy taking notes here because i think this is applies to to to life lessons too oh i think it's a really yeah really strong so like lying is a dangerous thing to do like you you want to avoid obvious lying yeah i mean i think when people play diplomacy for the first time they approach it as a game of deception and lying and and they ultimately if you talk to top diplomacy players what they'll tell you is that diplomacy is a game about trust and being able to build trust in an environment that encourages people to not trust anyone so so that's the ultimate tension in diplomacy how can this ai reason about whether you are being honest in your communication and how can the ai persuade you that it is being honest when it is telling you that hey i'm actually going to support you this turn is there some sense i don't know if you step back and think that this process will indirectly help us study human psychology so like if trust is the ultimate goal wouldn't that help us understand what are the fundamental aspects of forming trust between humans and between humans and ai i mean that's a really really important question that's much bigger than than strategy games it's how can that that's fundamental to the human robot interaction problem how do we form trust between intelligent entities so one of the things i'm really excited about with diplomacy there's never really been a good domain to investigate these kinds of questions yeah and diplomacy gives us a domain where trust is really at the center of it and it's not just like you've hired a bunch of mechanical turkers that you know are being paid and trying to get through the task as quickly as possible you have these people that are really invested in the outcome of the game and they're really trying to do the the best that they can and so i'm really excited that we're able to we we actually like have put together this we're open sourcing all of our models we're open sourcing all of the all of the code and we're making the data that we've used available to researchers so that they can investigate these kinds of questions so the data of the different the human and the ai ai play of diplomacy and the models that you use for the generation of the messages and the filtering yeah not not just even the data of the ai playing with the humans but all the training data that we that we had that we use to train the ai to understand how humans play the game we're setting up a system where researchers will be able to apply to be able to gain access to that data and be able to to use it in their own research would you say what is the name of the system we're calling the bot cicero cicero and what's the name like the you're open sourcing what's the name of the repository and and the like the the project is it also just called cicero the big project or are you still coming up with the name the the dataset comes from this website web diplomacy dot net is this site that's been online for like twenty years now and it's one of the main sites that people use to play diplomacy on it we've got like fifty thousand games of diplomacy with you know natural language communication over ten million messages so it's a pretty massive data set that people can use to we're hoping that the the academic community the research community is able to use it for for all sorts of interesting research questions so do you from having studied this game is this a sufficiently rich problem space to explore this kind of human ai interaction yeah absolutely and i i think it's i think it's maybe the best dataset that i can think of out there to to investigate these kinds of questions of negotiation trust persuasion i wouldn't say it's the best data set in the world for human ai interaction that's a very broad field but i think that it's definitely up there as like you know if if you're really interested in language models interacting with humans in you know a setting where their incentives are not fully aligned this seems like an ideal dataset for investigating that so you have you have a a paper with some impressive results and just an impressive paper they're taking this problem on what's the most exciting thing to you in terms of the results from the the paper well i think there's a few ideas or results yeah i think there's a few aspects of the results and that that i think are really exciting so first of all the fact that we were able to achieve such strong performance i was surprised by and pleasantly surprised by so we played forty games of diplomacy with real humans and the bot placed second out of all players that have played five or more games so it's about eighty players total nineteen of whom played five or more games and the bot was ranked second out of those players and the bot was was really good in two dimensions one being able to establish strong connections with the other players on the board being able to like persuade them to work with it being able to coordinate with them about like how it's going to work with them and then also the raw tactical and strategic aspect of the game you know being able to understand what the other players are likely to do being able to model their behavior and respond appropriately to that the bot also really excelled at what are some interesting things that the bot said by the way you're allowed to swear in the like are there rules to what you're allowed to say and not in diplomacy you can say whatever you want i think the site will get very angry at you if you start like threatening somebody and if we actually like if you threaten somebody you're you're supposed to do it politely yeah politely you know like keep it in character the the bot we actually had a researcher watching the bot twenty four seven for well whenever we play a game we have a bot watching it to make sure that it wouldn't go off the rails and start like threatening somebody or something like that i would just love it if the bots started like mocking mocking everybody like some weird quirky strategies would emerge have you seen anything interesting that you that's a weird that's a that's a weird behavior either the filter or the language model that was weird to you that was yeah there were definitely like things that the bot would would do that were not in line with like how humans would approach the game and that in in a good way the humans actually you know we we've talked to some expert diplomacy players about these results mhmm and their takeaway is that well maybe humans are approaching this the wrong way and this is actually like the right way to play the game so what's required to win like what what does it mean to mess up or to exploit the suboptimal behavior of a player like is there is there optimally rational behavior and irrational behavior that you need to estimate that kind of stuff like what what stands out to you like is there a crack that you can exploit is there like a weakness that you can exploit in the game that that that everybody's looking for well i i think you're asking kinda two questions there so one like modeling the irrationality and the suboptimality of of humans you can't in diplomacy you can't treat all the other players like they're machines and if you do that you're you're going to end up playing really poorly and so we actually ran this experiment so we we trained a bot in a two player zero sum version of diplomacy the same way that you might approach a game like chess or poker and the bot was superhuman it would crush any competitor and then we took that same training approach and we trained a bot for the full seven player version of the game through self play without any human data and we stuck it in a game with six humans and it got destroyed even in the version of the game where there's no explicit natural language communication it still got destroyed because it just wouldn't be able to understand how the other players were approaching the game and be able to to work with that can can you just linger on that meaning like there's an individual there's an individual personality to each player and then you're supposed to remember that but what do you mean it's not able to understand the the players well it would for example expect the human to support it in a certain way when the human would simply like think of like no i'm not supposed to support you here it's kind of like you know if you develop a self driving car and it's trained completely from scratch with other self driving cars it might learn to drive on the left side of the road mhmm that's a totally reasonable thing to do if you're with these other self driving cars that are also driving on the left side of the road but if you put it in an american city it's gonna crash but i guess the intuition i'm trying to build up is why does it then crush a human player heads up versus multiple this is an aspect of of two player zero sum versus games that involve cooperation so in a two player zero sum game you can do self play from scratch and you will arrive at the nash equilibrium where you don't have to worry about the other player playing in a very human suboptimal style that's just gonna be the the only way that deviating from a nash equilibrium would would change things is if it helped you so i what's the dynamic of cooperation that's effective in diplomacy do you always have to to have one friend in the game you always want to maximize your friends and minimize your enemies got it and boy and the the lying comes into play there so the the more friends you have the better yeah i mean i guess you have to attack somebody or else you're not gonna make progress alright so that's the tension but man this is too real this is too real to this is too too close to geo geopolitics of actual military conflict in the world okay that's fascinating so that cooperation element is what makes the game really really hard yep and to give you an like an example of of how this suboptimality and irrationality comes into play there's a really common situation in a game of diplomacy that where one player starts to win and they're like at the point where they're controlling about half the map yeah and the remaining players who have all been fighting each other the whole game all have to like work together now to stop this other player from winning or else everybody's gonna lose and it's kinda like you know game of thrones like i don't know if you've seen the show where like you know you got the the others coming from the north and like all the people have to start work out their differences and stop them from from taking over and the bot will do this the the bot will work with the other players to stop the superpower from winning but if it doesn't really if it's trained from scratch or it doesn't really have a good grounding in how humans approach it it will also at the same time attack the other players with its extra units so all the units that are not necessary to stop the superpower from winning it will use those to grab as many centers as possible from the other players and in totally rational play the other players should just live with that you know they have to understand like hey a score of one is better than a score of zero so so okay he's grabbed my centers but i i'll just deal with it but humans don't act that way right the human gets really angry at the bot and ends up throwing the game because you know i'm gonna screw you over because you did something that's not fair to me got it and are you supposed to model that is the boss supposed to model that kind of human frustration yeah exactly and so that is something that seems almost impossible to model purely from scratch without any human data it's a very cultural thing yeah and so you need human data to be able to understand that hey that's how humans behave and you have to work around that it might be suboptimal it might be irrational but but that's an aspect of of humanity that you have to you have to deal with so how difficult is it to train on human data given that human data is very limited versus what us a purely self play mechanism can generate that's actually one of the major challenges that we faced in the research that we had a good amount of human data we had about fifty thousand games what we try to do is leverage as much soft play as possible while still leveraging the human data so what we do is we do soft play very similar to how it's been done in poker and go but we try to regularize the self play towards the human data basically the the way to think about it is we penalize the bot for choosing actions that are very unlikely under how under the human dataset and how do you know is there is this some kind of function that says this is human like and not yeah so we we train a bot through supervised learning to model the human play as much as possible so we basically like train a neural net on those fifty thousand games and that gives us an approximate that gives us a policy that resembles to some extent how humans actually play the game now this isn't a perfect model of human play because we don't have unlimited data we don't have unlimited neural net capacity but it gives us some approximation is there some data on the internet that's useful besides just diplomacy so on the language side of things is there some can you go to like reddit and so sort of background model formulation that that's useful for the game of diplomacy yeah absolutely and so for the language model which is kinda like a separate question you know we didn't use the language model during self play training but we pretrained the language model on you know tons of internet data as much as possible and then we fine tuned it specifically on the diplomacy games so we are able to like leverage the wider dataset in order to fill in some of the gaps in like how communication happens more broadly besides just like specifically in these diplomacy games okay cool so what what's some what are some interesting things that came to life from this from this work to you like what what are some insights about about games with where natural language is involved and cooperation deep cooperation is involved well i think there's a few insights so first of all the fact that you can't rely purely or even largely on self play that you really have to have an understanding of how humans approach the game i think that that's one of the major conclusions that i'm drawing from this work and that is i think applicable more broadly to a lot of different games so we've actually already taken the approaches that we've used in diplomacy and tried them on a cooperative card game called hanabi and we've had a lot of success in that game as well on the language side i think the fact that we were able to control the language model through this intense approach was very effective and it allowed us instead of just imitating how humans would communicate we're able to go beyond that and able to feed into its superhuman strategies that it can then you know generate messages corresponding to is there something you could say about detecting whether a person or ai is lying or not the bot doesn't explicitly try to calculate whether somebody is lying or not but what it will do is try to predict what actions they're going to take given the communications given the messages that they've sent to us so given our conversation what do i think you're going to do and implicitly there is a calculation about whether you're lying to me in that you know if if you're based on your messages if i think you're going to attack me this turn even though your messages say that you're not then you know essentially the bot is predicting that you're lying but it doesn't view it as as lying the same way that we would view it as lying but you could probably reformulate with all the same data and make a classifier lying or not yeah i think i think you could do that that was not something that we were focused on but i think that it is possible that you know if you came up with some measurements of like what does it mean to tell a lie because there's there's a spectrum right like if you're withholding some information is that a lie if you're mostly telling the truth but you forgot to mention this like one action out of like ten is that a lie it's hard to draw the line but you know if you're willing to do that and then you could possibly use it to to this feels like an argument inside a relationship now what constitutes a lie depends what you mean by the definition of the word is okay still it's fascinating because trust and lying is all intermixed into this and it's language models that are becoming more and more sophisticated it's just a fascinating space to explore what what what what do you see as the future of this work that is inspired by the breakthrough performance that you're getting here with diplomacy i think there's a few different directions to take this work i i think really what it's showing us is the potential that language models have i mean i think a lot of people didn't think that this kind of result was possible even today despite all the progress that's been made in language models and so it shows us how we can leverage the power of things like self play on top of language models to get increasingly better performance and the ceiling is really much higher than what we have right now is this transferable somehow to to chatbots for the more general task of dialogue so because there is a kind of negotiation here a dance between entities that are trying to cooperate and at the same time a little bit adversarial which i think maps somewhat to the general you know the entire process of reddit or like internet communication you're cooperating you're adversarial you're having debates you're having camaraderie all that kind of stuff i think one of the things that's really useful about diplomacy is that we have a well defined value function there is a a well defined score that the bot is trying to optimize and and in a in a setting like a general chatbot setting it needs it would need that kind of objective in order to fully leverage the techniques that we've developed what about like what we talked about earlier with npcs inside video games like how can it be used to create for elder scrolls six more compelling npcs that you could talk to instead of instead of committing all kinds of violence with a sword and fighting dragons just sit in a tavern and drink all day and talk to the chatbot the way that we've approached ai and diplomacy is you condition the language on an intent now that intent in diplomacy is an is an action but it doesn't have to be and you can imagine you know you could have npcs in video games or the metaverse or whatever where there's some intent or there's some objective that they're trying to maximize and you can specify what that is and and then the language can correspond to that intent now i'm not saying that this is you know happening imminently but i'm saying that this is like a future application potentially of this direction of research so what's the more general formulation of this making self play be able to scale the way self play does and still maintain human like behavior the way that we've approached self play in diplomacy is like we're we're trying to come up with good intents to condition the language model on and the space of intents is actions that can be played in the game now there is like the potential to have a broader set of intents things like you know long term cooperation or long term objectives or you know gossip about what another player was saying these are things that we're currently not conditioning the language model on and so it's not able to we're not able to control it to say like oh you should be talking about this thing right now but it's quite possible that you could expand the scope of intents to be able to allow it to talk about those things now in the process of doing that the self play would become much more complicated and so that is a potential for for future work okay the increase in the number of intense i still am not quite clear how you keep the self play integrated into the human world yep i'm i'm a little bit loose on the on understanding how you do that so we train a neural net to imitate the human data as closely as possible and that's what we call the anchor policy and now when we're doing self play the the problem with the anchor policy is that it's not a perfect approximation of how humans actually play because we don't have infinite data because we don't have unlimited neural network capacity it's actually a relatively suboptimal approximation of how humans actually play and we can improve that approximation by adding planning and rl and so what we do is we get a better approximation a better model of human play by during the self play process we say you can deviate from this human anchor policy if there is an action that has you know particularly high expected value but it would have to be a really high expected value in order to to deviate from from this human like policy so you basically say try to maximize your expected value while at the same time stay as close as possible to the human policy and there is a parameter that controls those the the relative weighting of those competing objectives so the question i have is how sophisticated can the anchor policy get so have a policy that approximates human behavior right yep so as you increase the number of intents as you generalize the the space in which this is applicable and given that the human data is limited try to anticipate a policy that works for a much larger number of cases like how how difficult is the process of forming a damn good anchor policy well it really comes down to how much human data you have so it's all about scaling the human data i think the more human data you have the better and i think that that's going to be the major bottleneck in in scaling to to more complicated domains but that said you know there might be the potential just like in the language model where we leveraged you know tons of data on the internet and then specialized it for diplomacy there is the future potential that you can leverage huge amounts of data across the board and then specialize it in the dataset that you have for diplomacy and in that way you're essentially augmenting the amount of data that you have to what degree does this apply to the general the real world diplomacy the geopolitics you know there's a game theory has a history of being applied to understand and to give us hope about nuclear weapons for example the mutually assured destruction is a game theoretic concept that you can formulate some people say it's oversimplified but nevertheless here we are and we somehow haven't blown ourselves up do you see a future where this kind of this kind of system can be used to help us make decisions geopolitical decisions in the world well like i said the original motivation for the game of diplomacy was the failures of world war one the diplomatic failures that led to war and the real take home message of diplomacy is that you know if people approach diplomacy the right way then war is ultimately unsuccessful the way that i see it war is an inherently negative sum game right there's always a better outcome than war for all the parties involved and my hope is that you know as ai progresses then maybe this technology could be used to help people make better decisions across the board and you know hopefully avoid negative some outcomes like war yeah i would i mean i just came back from ukraine i'm going back there on deep personal levels think a lot about how peace can be achieved and i'm a big believer in conversation leaders getting together and having conversations and trying to understand each other yeah it's fascinating to think whether each one of those leaders can run a simulation ahead of time like if i'm an asshole what are the possible consequences if i'm nice what are the possible consequences my guess is that if the president of the united states got together with vladimir zelensky and vladimir putin that there would be significant benefits to the president of the united states not having an ego of kind of playing down of giving away a lot of chips for the future success of a world so giving a lot of power to the two presidents of the competing nations to achieve peace that's my guess but it'd be nice to run a bunch of simulations but then you have to have human data right you really because it's like the game of diplomacy is fundamentally different than geopolitics you need data you need like i guess that's the question i have like how transferable is this to like i don't know any kind of negotiation right like to any kind of low some local i don't know bunch of lawyers like arguing like at a at a divorce like divorce lawyers like how transferable this all kinds of human negotiation well i feel like this isn't a question that's unique to diplomacy i mean i think you look at rl breakthroughs reinforcement learning breakthroughs in previous games as well like you know ai for starcraft ai for atari you haven't really seen it deployed in the real world because you have these problems of it's really hard to collect a lot of data and you don't have you don't have a well defined action space you don't have a well defined reward function these are all things that you really need for reinforcement learning and planning to be really successful today now there are some domains where you do have that code generation is one example theorem proving mathematics that's another example where you have a well defined action space you have a well defined reward function and those are the kinds of domains where i can see rl in the short term being incredibly powerful but yeah i i think that those are the barriers to deploying this at scale in the real world but the hope is that in the long run we'll be able to get there yeah but see diplomacy feels like closer to the real world than does starcraft like because it's natural language right you're you're operating in the space of intents and in the space of natural language that feels very close to the real world and it also feels like you could get data on that mhmm from the internet yeah and that's why i do think that diplomacy is taking a big step closer to the real world than anything that's came before in terms of game ai breakthroughs the fact that you know we're we're communicating in natural language we've we're leveraging the fact that we have this like general dataset of dialogue and and communication from a breadth of the internet that is that is a big step in that direction we're not a hundred percent there but but we're getting closer at least so if we actually return back to poker and chess are some of the ideas that you're learning here with diplomacy could you construct ai systems that play like humans like make for a fun opponent in a game of chess yeah absolutely we've already started looking into this direction a bit so we tried to use the techniques that we've developed for diplomacy to make chess and go ais and what we found is that it led to much more human like strong chess and go players the way that ai is like stockfish today play is in a very inhuman style it's very strong but it's very different from how humans play and so we can take the techniques that we've developed for diplomacy we do something similar in in chess and go and we end up with a bot that's both strong and human like to to elaborate on this a bit like one way to approach making a human like ai for chess is to collect a bunch of human games like a bunch of human grand master games and just to supervise learning on those games mhmm but the problem is that if you do that what you end up with is an ai that's substantially weaker than the human grandmasters that you've trained on because the neural net is not able to approximate the the nuance of the strategy this goes back to the planning thing that that i mentioned the search thing that i talked about before that these human grandmasters when they're playing they're using search and they're using planning and the neural net alone unless you have a a massive neural net that's like a thousand times bigger than what we have right now it's not able to approximate those details very effectively and on the other hand you can leverage search and planning very heavily but then what you end up with is an ai that plays in a very different style from how humans play the game now if you strike this intermediate balance by setting the the regularization parameters correctly and say you can do planning but try to keep it close to the human policy then you end up with an ai that plays in both a very human like style and a very strong style and you can actually even tune it to have a certain elo rating so you can say play in the style of like a twenty eight hundred elo human mhmm yeah i wonder if you could do specific type of humans or categories of humans so not not just skill but style yeah i think so and so this is this is where the the research gets interesting like you know one of the things that i was thinking about is and this is actually already being done i think there's a researcher at the university of toronto that's working on this is to make an ai that plays in the style of a particular player like magnus carlsen for example you can make an ai that plays like magnus carlsen and and then where i think this gets interesting is like hey maybe you're up against magnus carlsen in the world championship or something you can play against this magnus carlsen bot to prepare against the real magnus carlsen and you can try to explore strategies that he might struggle with and try to figure out like how do you beat this player in particular on the other hand you can also have magnus carlsen working with this bot to try to figure out where he's weak and where he needs to improve his strategy and so i can envision this future where data on specific chess and go players becomes extremely valuable because you can use that data to create specific models of how these particular players play so increasingly human like behavior in bots however as you've mentioned makes cheating cheat detection much harder it it does yeah the way that cheat detection works in a game like poker and a game like chess and go from what i understand is trying to see like is this person making moves that are very common among chess ais or you know ais in general but very uncommon among top human players and if you have the development of these ais that play in a very strong style but also very human like style then that poses serious challenges for cheat detection and it makes you now ask yourself a hard question about what is the role of ai systems as they become more and more integrated in our society and this kind of human ai integration has has some deep ethical issues that we should be aware of and also it's a kind of cybersecurity challenge right for to make you know one of the assumptions we have when we play games is that there's a trust that it's only humans involved and they're the better ai systems to create which makes it super exciting human like ai systems with different styles of humans is really exciting but then we have to have the defenses better and better and better if we're to trust that we can enjoy human versus human game in a deeply fair way mhmm it's fascinating so it's just it's humbling yeah i think there's a lot of like negative potential for this kind of technology but you know at the same time there's a lot of upside for it as well so you know for example right now it's really hard to learn how to get better in games like chess and poker and go because the way that the ai plays is so foreign and incomprehensible yeah but if you have these ais that are playing you know you can say like oh i'm a two thousand elo human how do i get to twenty two hundred now you can have an ai that plays in the style of a twenty two hundred elo human and that will help you get better or you know you you mentioned this problem of like how do you know that you're actually playing with humans when you're playing like online in in video games well now we have the potential of populating these like virtual worlds with agents like ai agents that are actually fun to play with and you don't have to always be playing with other humans to to you know have a fun time so yeah a lot a lot of upside potential too and i think you know with any sort of tool there's there's the potential for a lot of greatness and a lot of downsides as well so in the paper they got a chance to look at there's a section on ethical considerations what's in that section what are some ethical considerations here is it some of the stuff we already talked about there's some things that we've already talked about i think specific to diplomacy you know there's there's also the the challenge that the game is you know there is a deception aspect to the game and so you know developing language models that are capable of deception is i think a dicey issue and something that you know makes research on diplomacy particularly challenging and you know so so those kinds of issues of like should we even be developing ais that are capable of lying to people that's something that we have to you know think carefully about so cool i mean that you have to do that kind of stuff in order to figure out where the ethical lines are but i can see in the future it being illegal to have a consumer product that lies yeah yeah like like your personal assistant ai system is not allowed is always have to tell the truth but if if i ask it do i do i look did i get fatter over the past month i sure as hell want that ai system to lie to me mhmm so there's a trade off between lying and being and being nice yeah we have to somehow find right the ethics in that and we're back to discussions inside relationships anyway what were you saying oh yeah i was saying like yeah there's yeah that's kinda going to the question of like what what is a lie you know is it a white lie a bad lie is it an ethical lie yeah you know those kinds of questions boy we return time and time again to deep human questions as we design ai systems that's exactly what they do they put a mirror to humanity to help us understand ourselves there's there's also the issue of like you know in these diplomacy experiments in order to do a fair comparison you know what what we found is that there's an inherent anti ai bias in these kinds of games so we actually played the tournaments in a non language version of the game where you know we we told the participants like hey in every single game there's going to be an ai and what we found is that the humans would spend basically the entire game like trying to figure out who the bot was and then as soon as they thought they figured it out they would all team up and try to kill it mhmm and you know overcoming that inherent anti ai bias is is a is a challenge on the flip side i think when robots become the enemy that's when we get to heal our human divisions and then we can become one as long as we have one enemy it's it's that reagan thing when the alien show up that's when we we put our side our divisions and we become one one human species right we might have our differences but we're at least all human at least we all hate the robots no no no no i think there will be actually in the future something like a civil rights movement for robots i think that's the fascinating things about ai systems and they is they ask they force us to ask about ethical questions about what is sentience what is how do we feel about systems that are capable of suffering or capable of displaying suffering and how do we design products that show emotion and not how do we feel about that lying is another topic are we going to allow bots to lie and not and where's the balance between being nice and and and telling the truth i mean these are all fascinating human questions and it's like so exciting to be in the century we when we create systems that take these philosophical questions that have been asked for centuries and now we can engineer them inside systems mhmm or like you really have to answer them because you'll have transformational impact on on human society depending on what you design inside those systems it's fascinating and like you said i feel like diplomacy is a step towards the direction of the real world applying these rl methods towards the real world from from from all the breakthrough performances in go and chess and starcraft and dota this is this feels like the real world especially now my mind's been on war and military conflict this feels like it it can give us some deep insights about human behavior at the large geopolitical scale what do you think is the breakthrough or the directions of work that will take us towards solving intelligence towards creating agi systems you've been a part of creating by the way we should say a part of great teams that do this of creating systems that achieve breakthrough performances on before thought unsolvable problems like poker multiplayer poker diplomacy we're taking steps towards that direction what do you think it takes to go all the way to create superhuman level intelligence you know there's a lot of people trying to figure that out right now and you know i should say like the amount of progress that's been made especially in the past few years is truly phenomenal i mean you look at where ai was ten years ago and the idea that you could have ais that can generate language and generate images the way they're doing today yeah and able to play a game like diplomacy was just like unthinkable even even five years ago let alone ten years ago now there there are aspects of ai that i think are still lacking i think there's general agreement that one of the major issues with ai today is that it's very data inefficient it's very it requires a huge number of samples of training examples to be able to train you know you look at an ai that plays go and it needs millions of games of go to to learn how to play the game well whereas a human can pick it up in like you know i don't know how many games does a human go player go go grandmaster play in their lifetime probably you know in the thousands or tens of thousands i guess so that's that's one issue overcoming efficiency overcoming this challenge of data efficiency and this is particularly important if we want to deploy ai systems in real world settings where they're interacting with humans because you know for example with robotics it's really hard to generate a huge number of samples it's it's a different story when you're working in these you know totally virtual games where you can play a million games and it's no big deal i was planning on just launching like a thousand of these robots in austin i don't think it's illegal for legged robots to roam the streets and just collect data that's not a case yeah that could happen yeah i kinda i mean that's one way to overcome the data efficiency problem is to like scale it yeah like i i actually tried to see if if there's a law against robots like legged robots just operating in in the in the streets of a major city and there isn't i couldn't find any so i'll take it all the way to the supreme court robot rights okay anyway sorry you were saying so this so what what are the ideas for getting becoming more data efficient i mean that's that's the trillion dollar question in ai today i mean if you can figure out how to make ai systems more more data efficient then that's a huge breakthrough so nobody really knows right now it could be just a gigantic background model language model and then you do the training becomes like prompting that model to to essentially do a kind of querying a search into the space of the things that it's learned to customize that to whatever problem you're trying to solve so maybe if you form a large enough language model you can go quite quite a long way that you know i think there's some truth to that i mean you look at the way humans approach a game like poker they're not coming at it from scratch they're coming at it with a huge amount of background knowledge about you know how humans work how the world works the idea of money so it they're able to leverage that kind of information to to to pick up the game faster so it's not really a fair comparison to then compare it to an ai that's like learning from scratch and maybe one of the ways that we address this sample complexity problem is by allowing ais to leverage that general knowledge across a ton of different domains so like i said you did a lot of incredible work in the space of research and actually building systems what advice would you give to let's start with beginners what advice would you give to beginners interested in machine learning just they're at the very start of their journey and they're in high school and college thinking like this seems like a fascinating world what advice would you give them i i would say that there are a lot of people working on similar aspects of machine learning and to not be afraid to try something a bit different my my own path in ai is pretty atypical for a machine learning researcher today i mean i started out working on game theory and and then shifting more towards reinforcement learning as time went on and that actually had a lot of benefits i think because it allowed me to look at these problems in a very different way from the way a lot of machine learning researchers view it and that comes with drawbacks in some respects like i think there's definitely aspects of machine learning where you know i'm i'm weaker than most of the researchers out there but i think that diversity of perspective you know when i'm working with my teammates there's something that i'm bringing to the table and there's something that they're bringing to the table and that kind of collaboration becomes very fruitful for that reason so there could be problems like like poker like you've chosen diplomacy there could be problems like that still out there that you can just tackle even if it seems extremely difficult i think that there's a lot of challenges challenges left and i think having a diversity of viewpoints and backgrounds is really helpful for working together to figure out how to tackle those kinds of challenges so as a as a beginner so that i i would say that's that's more for like a grad student where they already built up a base like a complete beginner what's a good journey so for you that was doing some more on the math side of things doing game theory all that good so it's basically build up a foundation in something so programming mathematics it could even be physics but build build that foundation yeah i would say build a strong foundation in math and computer science and statistics and these kinds of areas but but don't be afraid to try something that's different and learn something that's different from you know the the thing that everybody else is doing to get into machine learning you know there's there's value in having a different background than everybody else yeah so but certainly having a strong math background especially in things like linear algebra and statistics and probability are incredibly helpful today for for learning about and understanding machine learning do you think one day we'll be able to since you're taking steps from poker to diplomacy one day we'll be able to figure out how to live life optimally well what is it like in in poker and diplomacy you need a value function you need to have a reward system and so what does it mean to live a life that's optimal so okay so then you can exactly like lay down a reward function being like i wanna be rich or i want to be i want to be in a happy relationship and then he'll say well do x you know there's there's a lot of talk today about in in ai safety circles about like misspecification of you know reward function so you you say like okay my objective is to be rich and maybe the ai tells you like okay well if you wanna maximize the probability that you're rich go rob a bank sure and so you wanna is that is that really what you want is your objective really to be rich at all costs or is it more nuanced than that so the un understand the consequences yeah yeah so i'll may yeah that that that's so may maybe life is more about defining the reward function that minimizes the unintended consequences than it is about the actual policy that gets you to the reward function maybe life is just about constantly updating the reward function i think one of the challenges in life is is figuring out exactly what that reward function is sometimes it's pretty hard to specify the same way that you know trying to handcraft the optimal policy in a game like chess is really difficult it's not so clear cut what the reward function is for for life i think one day ai will figure it out and i wonder what that would be until then i just really appreciate the kind of work you're doing and it's it's really fascinating taking a leap into a more and more real world like problem space and just achieving incredible results by applying reinforcement learning now since i saw you work on poker you've been a constant inspiration it's an honor to get to finally talk to you and this is really fun thanks for having me thanks for listening to this conversation with noel brown to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from sun tzu and the art of war the whole secret lies in confusing the enemy so that he cannot fathom our real intent thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
