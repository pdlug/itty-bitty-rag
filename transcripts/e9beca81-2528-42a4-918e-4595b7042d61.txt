episode is brought to you by hidden layer a platform that provides security for your machine learning models this episode with annie jacobson is terrifying on many fronts it's terrifying because you get to see just how close we are to the brink of self destruction just how few people are involved in saying yes launch nuclear war just how easy it is for little mistakes little misunderstandings to lead to nuclear war and on this point of hidden layer of cybersecurity just how easy it is to hack a system that creates misinformation that results in nuclear war cybersecurity the attack and the defense is really the story of the twenty first century this is where the battles will be fought this is where suffering might be created or alleviated or prevented so this is a really really really important field and it's not talked about enough there's this sexy field of sort of ai safety where you talk about kinda the existential risk the ethical risk the all of that kind of stuff of artificial intelligence as becomes smarter and smarter and smarter but sometimes it's the stupid stuff it's the vulnerabilities the stupid stuff is not the so stupid stuff it's the basic capacity of an intelligence system to be hacked so i'm a really big fan of hidden layer doing this kind of work of helping businesses figure out which are the secure models which are not which are the basic steps

between the united states and russia kill so i'm coming back at you with a very dark answer and a very big number and that number is five billion people you go second by second minute by minute hour by hour what would happen if the nuclear war started so there's a lot of angles on which i would love to talk to you about this at first how would the deaths happen mhmm in the short term and the long term so to start off the reason i wrote the book is so that readers like you could see in appalling detail just how horrific nuclear war would be and as you said second by second minute by win minute the book covers nuclear launch to nuclear winter i purposely don't get into the politics that lead up to that or the national security maneuvers or the posturing or any of that i just want people to know nuclear war is insane and every source i interviewed for this book from secretary of defense you know all retired nuclear subforce commander stratcom commander fema director etcetera on and on and on nuclear weapons engineers they all shared with me the common denominator that nuclear war is insane you know first millions then tens of millions then hundreds of millions of people will die in the first seventy two minutes of a nuclear war and then comes nuclear win winter where the billions happen from starvation and so the shock power of all of this is meant for each and every one of us to say wait what this actually exists behind the veil of national security and i don't know if you know most people do not think about nuclear war on a daily basis and yet hundreds of thousands of people in the nuclear command and control are at the ready in the event it happens but it doesn't take too many people to start one in the words of richard garwin who was the nuclear weapons engineer who drew the plans for the ivy mike thermonuclear bomb the first thermonuclear bomb ever exploded in nineteen fifty two garwin shared with me his opinion that all it takes is one nihilistic madman with a nuclear arsenal to start a nuclear war and that's how i begin the scenario what are the different ways it could start like literally who presses a button and what does it take to press a button so the way it starts is in space meaning the us defense department has a early warning system and the system in space is called sbirs it's a constellation of satellites that is keeping an eye on all of america's enemies so that the moment an icbm launches the satellite in space and i'm talking about one tenth of the way to the moon that's how powerful these satellites are in geosync they see the hot rocket exhaust on the icbm in a fraction of a second after it launches a fraction of a second and so there begins this horrifying policy called launch on warning right and that's the us counterattack meaning the reason that the united states is so ferociously watching for a nuclear launch somewhere around the globe is so that the nuclear command and control system in the us can move into action to immediately make a counter strike because we have that policy launch on warning which is exactly like it says it means the united states will not wait to absorb a nuclear attack it will launch nuclear weapons in response before the bomb actually hits so the president as part of the launch on warning policy has six minutes i guess can't launch for six minutes but at six minute mark from that first morning the president can launch and that was one of the most remarkable details to really nail down for this book when i was reporting this book and talking to secretary of defenses for example who are the people who advise the president on this matter right you say to yourself wait a minute how could that possibly be and so let's unpack that right so in addition to the launch on warning concept there's this other insane concept called sole presidential authority and you might think in a democracy that's impossible right you can't just start a war well you can just start a nuclear war if you're the commander in chief the president of the united states in fact you're the only one who can do that and we can get into later why that exists i was able to get the origin story of that concept from los alamos they declassified it for the book but the idea behind that is that nuclear war will unfold so fast only one person can be in charge the president he asked permission of no one not the secretary of defense not the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff not the us congress so built into that is this extraordinary speed you talk about the six minute window and some people say oh that's ridiculous how do we know that six minute window well here's the best sort of you know hitting the nail on the head statement i can give you which is in president reagan's memoirs he refers to the six minute window and he says he he calls it irrational which it is he says how can anyone make a decision to launch nuclear weapons based on a blip on a radar scope his words to unleash armageddon and yet that is the reality behind nuclear war just imagine sitting there one person because the president is a human being sitting there just got the warning that russia launched you have six minutes you know i i meditate on my mortality every day and here you would be sitting and meditating contemplating not just your own mortality but the mortality of all the people you know loved ones just imagining like what what would be going through my head is all the people i know and love like personally and knowing that there'll be no more most likely and if they somehow survive they will be suffering and will eventually die i guess the question that kept coming up is how do we stop this is it inevitable that it's going to be escalated to a full on nuclear war that destroys everything and it seems like it it will be it's inevitable in the position of the president it's almost inevitable that they have to respond i mean one of the things i found shocking was how little apparently most presidents know about the responsibility that literally lays at their feet right so you may think through this six minute window i may think through this six minute window but what i learned like for example former secretary of defense leon panetta was really helpful in explaining this to me because before he was secdef he served as the director of the cia and before that he was the white house chief of staff and so he has seen these different roles that have been so close to the president but he explained to me that when he was the white house chief of staff for president clinton he noticed how president clinton didn't want to ever really deal with the nuclear issue because he had so many other issues to deal with and that only when panetta became secretary of defense he told me did he really realize the weight of all of this because he knew he would be the person that the president would turn to were he to be notified of a nuclear attack and by the way it's the launch on warning it's the it's the the ballistic missile seen from outer space by the satellite and then there also must be a second confirmation from a ground radar system but in that process which is just a couple minutes everyone is getting ready to notify the president and one of the first people that gets notified by norad or by stratcom or by nro these different parties that all see the early warning data one of the first peoples that's notified is the secretary of defense as well as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff because those two together are going to brief the president about you know sir you have six minutes to decide and that's where you realize the immediacy of all of this is so counter to imagining the scenario and again all the presidents come into office i have learned understanding the idea that of deterrence this idea that we have these massive arsenals of nuclear weapons pointed at one another ready to launch so that we never have nuclear war but what we're talking about now is what if we did what if we did and what you've raised is like this really spooky eerie subtext of the world right now because many of the nuclear armed nations are in direct conflict with other nations and for the first time in decades nuclear threats are actually coming out of the mouths of leaders this is shocking so deterrence the polite implied assumption is that nobody will launch and if they did we would launch back and everybody would be dead but that assumption falls apart completely the whole philosophy of it falls apart once the first launch happens absolutely you have six minutes to decide wait a minute are we going to hit back and kill everybody on earth or do we turn the other cheek in the most horrific way possible well when when nuclear war starts there's no like battle for new york or battle for moscow it's just literally it's you know it was called in the cold war push button warfare but in essence that is that is what it is let's get some numbers on the table if you don't mind right because when you're saying like wait a minute we're just hoping that it holds right let's just talk about russia and the us the arsenals that are literally pointed at one another right now right so the united states has one thousand seven hundred and seventy nuclear weapons deployed meaning those weapons could launch in as little as sixty seconds and up to a couple minutes some of them on the bombers might take an hour or so russia has one thousand six hundred and seventy four deployed nuclear weapons same scenario their weapon systems are on par with ours that's not to mention the twelve thousand five hundred nuclear weapons amongst the nine nuclear armed nations but when you think about those kind of arsenals of just between the united states and russia you real and you realize everything can be launched in seconds and minutes then you realize the madness of matt that this idea that no one would launch because it would assure everyone's destruction yes but what if someone did and in my interviews with scores of top tier national security advisers people who advise the president people who are responsible for these decisions if they had to be made every single one of them said it could happen they didn't say this would never happen and so the idea is worth thinking about because i believe that it pulls back the veil on a fundamental security that if someone were to use a tactical nuclear weapon oh well it's just an escalation it's far more than that so to you the use of a tactical nuclear weapon maybe you can draw the line between a tactical and a strategic nuclear weapon that could be a catalyst like that's a very difficult thing to walk back from oh my god almost certainly and again any every person in the national security environment tells will will agree with that right certainly on the american side strategic weapons those are like big weapons systems the america has a nuclear triad we have our icbms which are the silo based missiles that have a nuclear warhead in the nose cone and they can get from one continent to the other in roughly thirty minutes then we have our bombers b fifty twos and b twos that are nuclear capable those take travel time to get to another continent those can also be recalled the icbms cannot be recalled or redirected once launched that one is a particularly terrifying one so land launched missiles rockets with a warhead can't be recalled cannot be recalled or redirected and speaking of how little the presidents generally know as we were talking a moment ago president reagan in nineteen eighty three gave a press conference where he misstated that submarine launched ballistic missiles could be recalled they cannot be recalled so that gives you here's the guy in charge of the arsenal if it has to get let loose and he doesn't even know that they cannot be recalled so this is the kind of misinformation and disinformation and and you know un secretary general antonio guterres recently said misunderstanding one miscalculation away from nuclear armageddon so just to sort of linger on the previous point of tactical nukes so you're describing strategic nukes land launched bombers submarine launched what are tactical nukes so that's the triad right and we have the triad and russia has the triad tactical nuclear weapons are smaller warheads that were designed to be used in battle and that is what russia is sort of threatening to use right now that is this idea that you would you know make a decision on the battlefield in an operational environment to use a tactical nuclear weapon you're just sort of upping the ante but the problem is that all treaties are based on this idea of no nuclear use right you cannot cross that line and so the what would happen if the line is crossed is so devastating to even consider i think that the conversation is well worth having among everyone you know that is in a power of position how as you know the un secretary general said this is madness right this is madness we must come back from the brink we are at the brink can we talk about some other numbers so you mentioned the number of warheads so land launched how long does it take to travel across the ocean from the united states to to russia from russia to united states from china to the united states how approximately how long when i was writing an earlier book on darpa the the pentagon science agency i went to a library down in san diego called the geezel library to look at herb york's papers herb york was the first chief scientist for the pentagon for darpa then called arpa and i had been trying to get the number from the various agencies that be to answer you like what is the exact number and how do we know it and like does it change and you know as technology advances does that number reduce all these kinds of questions and no one will answer that question on an official level and so much to my surprise i found the answer in herb york's like dusty archive of papers and this is information that was jealously guarded i mean it didn't it was not it's not necessarily classified but it certainly wasn't out there and i felt like wow herb york left these behind for someone like me to find right and what the process he wanted to know the answer to your question and as the guy in charge of it all so he hired this group of scientists who then and still are in many ways like the pent the superman scientists of the pentagon and they're called the jason scientists many conspiracies about them abound i interviewed their founder and i've interviewed many of them but they whittled the number down to seconds okay specifically for herb york and it goes like this because this is where my jaw dropped and i went wow okay so twenty six minutes and forty seconds and it happens in three phases very simple and interesting to remember because then suddenly all of this makes more sense boost phase mid course phase and then terminal phase okay boost phase five minutes that's when the rocket launches so you just imagine a rocket going off the launch pad and the fire beneath it again that's why the satellites can see it okay now it's becoming visual now it makes sense to me right five minutes and that's where the rocket can be tracked and then imagine learning wait a minute after five minutes the rocket can no longer be seen from space the satellite can only see the hot rocket exhaust then the missile enters its mid course phase twenty minutes and that's the ballistic part of it where it's kind of flying up at between five hundred and seven hundred miles above the earth mhmm and moving very fast and with the earth until it gets very close to its target in the last one hundred seconds our terminal phase it's where the warhead reenters the atmosphere and detonates twenty six minutes and forty seconds now in my scenario i open with north korea launching a one megaton nuclear warhead at washington dc that's the nihilistic madman maneuver that's the bolt out of the blue attack that everyone in washington will tell you they're afraid of and north korea is a little has a little bit different geography and so i had mit professor emeritus ted postel do the math mhmm thirty three minutes from a launchpad in pyongyang to the east coast of the united states you get the idea it's about thirty minutes but hopefully now that allows readers to suddenly see all this as a real you you almost see it as you know as poetry as terrible as that may sound you can visualize it and suddenly it makes sense and i think the sense making part of it is really what i'm after in this book because i want people to understand on the on the one hand it's incredibly simple it's just the people that have made it so complicated but it's one of those things that can change all of world history in a matter of minutes we just don't as a human civilization have experience with that but it doesn't mean it'll never happen it can happen just like that i mean i think what you're after and i couldn't agree more with is like why is why is this fundamentally annihilating system a system of mass genocide as john rubel you know in the book refers to it why is it still exist you know we've had seventy five years since there have been two superpowers with the nuclear bomb so that threat has been there for seventy five years and we have managed to stay alive one of the reasons why so many of the sources in the book agreed to talk to me people who had not previously gone on the record about all of this was because they are now approaching the end of their lives they spent their lives dedicated to preventing nuclear world war three mhmm and they'll be the first people to tell you we're closer to this as a reality than ever before and so on the bright the only bright side of any of this is that like the answer lies most definitely in communication so there's a million other questions here i think the details are fascinating and important to understand so one you also say nuclear submarines you mentioned about thirty minutes twenty twenty six thirty three minutes but with nuclear submarines that number can be much much lower so how long does it take for a warhead to missile to reach the east coast in the united states from a submarine just when you thought it was really bad yeah and then you kind of realize about the submarines i mean the submarines are what are called second strike capacity right and you know it was described submarines were described to me this way they are as dangerous to civilization and let me just say a nuclear armed nuclear powered submarine is as dangerous to civilization as an asteroid okay they are unstoppable they are unlocatable the former chief of the nuclear submarine forces admiral michael connor told me it's easier to find a grapefruit sized object in space than a submarine under the sea okay so these things are like hell machines and they're moving around throughout the oceans ours russia's china's maybe north korea's constantly and we now know they're sneaking up to the east and west coast of the united states within a couple hundred miles how do we know that why do we know that well i found a document inside of a budget that the defense department was going to congress for more money recently and showed maps of precisely where these submarines how close they were getting to the eastern seaboard so wait wait wait so nuclear subs are getting within two hundred miles couple hundred miles yes they weren't precise on the number but when you look at the map yep and that's when you're talking about under ten minutes from launch to to strike undetectable and they're undetectable the the map making is done after the fact because of a lot of underwater surveillance systems that we have you know but in real time you cannot find a a nuclear submarine and you know just the way a submarine launches goes a hundred and fifty feet below the surface to launch its ballistic missile i mean it comes out of the missile tube and with enough thrust that the thrusters the boot they ignite outside the water mhmm and then they move into boost and so the technology involved is just stunning and shocking and again trillions of dollars spent so that we never have a nuclear war but my god what if we did as you write they're called the handmaidens of the apocalypse what a terrifying label i mean you one one of the things you also write about so for the land launched ones they're presumably underground so the silos how long does it take to go from like pressing the button to them emerging from underground for launch and is is that part detectable or it's only the the heat so what's interesting about the silos america has four hundred silos right we've had more but we have four hundred and they're underground and they're called minutemen right after the revolutionary war heroes but the sort of joke in washington is they're not called minute men for nothing because they can launch in one minute yeah right so the president orders the launch of the icbms icbm stands for intercontinental ballistic missile he orders the launch and they launch sixty seconds later and then they take thirty some odd minutes to get to where they're going the submarines take about fourteen or fifteen minutes from the presidential from the launch command to actually launching and that has to do i surmise with the location of the submarine its depth some of these things are so highly classified and others other details are shockingly available if you look deep enough or if you ask enough questions and you can go from one document to the next to the next and really find these answers not to ask top secret questions but to what degree do you think the russians know the locations of the saolas in the us and vice versa lex you can you and i can find the location of every silo right now they're all there and before they were there on on you know google they were there in maps because we're a democracy and we make these things known okay now what's tricky is that russia and north korea rely upon what are called road mobile launchers right so russia has a lot of underground silos you know all of the scenario takes you through these different facilities that really do exist mhmm and they're all sourced with how many weapons they have and their launch procedures and whatnot but in addition to having underground silos they have road mobile launchers and that means you you just have one of these giant icbms on a twenty two axle truck mhmm that can move stealthily around the country so that it can't be targeted by the us defense department we don't have those in america because presumably the average you know american isn't gonna go for like the icbm road mobile launcher driving down the street in your town or city which is why the defense department will justify we need the second strike capacity capability the submarines right because you know the i mean the wonky stuff that is worth looking into as a if you really dig the book and are like wait a minute it's all footnoted where you can learn more about how these systems have changed over time and why more than anything it's very difficult to get out of this catch twenty two conundrum that you know we need nuclear weapons to keep us safe that is the real enigma because the other guys have them right and the other guys have sort of more sinister ways of of using them or at least that's what the nomenclature out of the pentagon will always be when anyone tries to say we just need to really think about full disarmament you've written about intelligence agencies how good are the intelligence agencies on this how much does cia know about the the russian the russian launch sites and capabilities and command and control procedures and all of this and vice versa i mean all of this because it's decades old is really well known if you go to the federation of american scientists they have a team led by a guy called hans christiansen who runs what's called the nuclear notebook and he and his team every year are keeping track of this number of warheads on these number of weapon systems and because of the treaties the different signatories to the treaty all report these numbers and of course the different intelligence community people are keeping track of what's being you know revealed honestly and and reported with transparency and what is being hidden the real issue is the new systems that russia is working on right now then that will lead us you know we are kind of moving into an era whereby the the threat of actually having new weapon systems that are nuclear capable is very real because of the escalating tensions around the world and that's where the cia i would guess is doing most of its work right now so most of your research is kinda looking at the the older versions of the system and presumably there's potentially secret development of new ones hopefully not violates treaties yes so yes that is where the intelligence agencies but you know at a point it's overkill literally and figuratively right people are up in arms about these hypersonic weapons well we have a hypersonic weapons program you know falcon google black swift right this is lockheed's doing you know we're darpa exists to create the vast weapon systems of the future that is its job it has been doing that since its creation in nineteen fifty seven i would never believe that we aren't ahead of everyone call me you know overinformed or naive one or the other that would be my position because darpa works from the chicken or the egg scenario you know that like once once you learn about something once you learn russia's created this you know typhoon submarine which may or may not you know be viable it's too late if you don't already have one we'll probably talk about darpa a little bit one of the things that makes me sad about lockheed many things make me sad about lockheed but one of the things is because it's very top secret you can't show off all the incredible engineering go going on there the other thing that's more philosophical darpa also is that war seems to stimulate most of our not most but a large percent of our exciting innovation and engineering and so but that's also the pragmatic fact of life on earth is that the risk of annihilation is is a great motivator for for for innovation for engineering and so on but yes i would not discount the united states in its ability to build the weapons of the future nuclear included again terrifying can you tell me about the nuclear football as it's called i think americans are familiar with the football at least anyone who sort of you know follows national security concepts because it's a satchel it's a leather satchel that is always with a military aid in secret service nomenclature that's the mill aide and he's trailing around the president twenty four seven three hundred and sixty five days a year and also the vice president by the way with the ability to launch nuclear and it's always with the president and it's always with the president to report this part of the book i interviewed a lot of people in the secret service that are with the president and talk about this and the director of the secret service a guy called lou merletti told me a story that i just really found fascinating he was also in charge of the president's detail president clinton this was before he was director of the secret service and he told me the story about how he said the football is with the president at all times period okay they were traveling to syria and clinton was meeting with president assad and they got into an elevator clinton and the secret service team and one of assad's guys was like no you know like about the mill aide and lou said it was like a standoff because there was no way they were not going to have the president with his football in an elevator and it kind of sums up for me anyways you you realize what goes into every single one of these decisions you realize the massive system of systems behind every item you might just see in in passing and glancing on the news as you see the mill aide carrying that satchel well what's in that satchel i really dug into that to report this book -paul what is in that satchel -hannah okay so well okay first of all that is you know people always say it's incredibly classified i mean people talk about ufos it's incredibly i mean come on guys that is nothing burger right you wanna know what's really classified what's in that football right what's in that satchel but the pdd presidential emergency action directives right those have never been leaked no one knows what they are what we do know from one of the mill aids who spoke on the record a guy called buzz patterson he describes the president's orders right so if a nuclear war has begun if the president has been told there are nuclear missiles one or more coming at the united states you have to launch in a counterattack right the red clock is ticking you have to get the blue impact clock ticking he needs to look at this list to decide what targets to strike and what weapon systems to use and that is what is on according to buzz patterson a piece of like sort of laminated plastic he described it like a denny's menu mhmm and from that menu the president chooses targets and chooses weapon systems and it's probably super old school like all top secret systems are because they have to be tested over and over and over and over and over yes and it's nondigital nondigital it might literally be a denny's menu from hell right and there's a meanwhile i learned this only in reporting the book there is a identical black book inside the stratcom bunker in nebraska okay so let me three command bunkers are involved when when nuclear war begins right there's the bunker beneath the pentagon which is called the national military command center okay mhmm then there is the bunker beneath cheyenne mountain which everyone has you know or many people have heard of because it's been made famous in movies right that is a very real bunker and then there is a third bunker which people are not so familiar with which is the bunker beneath strategic command in nebraska and so it's described to me this way the pentagon bunker is the beating heart the cheyenne mountain bunker is the brains and the stratcom bunker is the muscle the stratcom commander will receive word from the president launch orders and then directs the hundred and fifty thousand people beneath him what to do okay from the bunker in beneath stratcom that's before he runs you know he gets the orders then he has to run out of the building and jump onto what's called the doomsday plane we'll get into that in a minute let me just finish the i mean but again this is great right these are the details this is like these are the systematic sequential details that happen in seconds and minutes and reporting them i never cease to be amazed by what a system it is you know a a follows b you know just it's just numerical right yeah but as we discussed this procedure each individual person that follows that procedure might lose the big picture of the whole thing i mean especially when you realize what what is happening yep that almost out of fear you just follow the steps yep or okay so imagine this imagine being the president you got that six minute win you have to you're looking at your list of strike options mhmm you're being briefed by your chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and your sec staff and this other really spooky detail in the stratcom bunker in addition to the nuclear strike adviser who can answer very specific questions if the president's like wait a minute why are we striking that and not that there's also a weather officer and this is the kind of human detail that kept me up at night because that weather officer is in charge of explaining to the president really fast how many people are going to die and how many people are going to die in minutes weeks months and years from radiation follow-up because a lot of that has to do with the weather system yes yes and so these kinds of the humanness you know balanced out with the mechanization of it all mhmm is it's just really grotesque so the doomsday plane from stratcom yeah what's that where is it going it's on it right it says it's on it okay ready yeah it's gonna fly in circles mhmm that's where it's going it's flying in circles around the united states of america so that nuclear weapons can be launched from the air after the ground systems are taken out by the incoming icbms or the incoming submarine launched ballistic missiles this has been in play since the fifties this is these these are the contingency plans for when nuclear war happens so again going back to this absurd paradox nuclear war will never happen you know mutual assured destruction deputy director of stratcom gave to a very close knit group where he said yes deterrence will hold but if it fails everything unravels and think about that word unravels right and the unraveling is you know the doomsday plane launches the stratcom commander jumps in he's in that plane he's flying around the united states and he's making decisions because the pentagon's been taken out at nine eleven by the way bush was in the doomsday plane and bush had to make decisions quickly but not so quickly not as quickly as he would have needed have done if there's a nuclear launch i mean six minutes it basically happens in three acts there's the first twenty four minutes the next twenty four minutes and the last twenty four minutes and that is the reality of nuclear weapons what is the interceptor capabilities of the united states how many nuclear missiles can be stopped i was at a dinner party with a very informed person right like somebody who really you know should have known this and i this is what i was considering writing and reporting this book and he said to me oh annie that would never happen because of our powerful interceptor system okay well he's wrong let me tell you about our powerful interceptor system first of all we have forty four interceptor missiles total period full stop let me repeat forty four okay earlier we were talking about russia's one thousand six hundred and seventy deployed nuclear weapons how are they how are those forty four interceptor missiles gonna work right and they also have a success rate of around fifty percent so they work fifty percent of the time there are forty of them in alaska and there are four of them at vandenberg air force base in santa barbara okay and they are responsible at about nine minutes into the scenario right after the icbm has finished that five minute boost phase we talked about now it's in mid course phase and the ground radar systems have identified yes this is an incoming icbm mhmm and now the interceptor missiles have to launch right it's essentially shooting a missile with a missile inside the interceptor which is just a big giant rocket in its nose cone it has what's called a the aptly named exoatmospheric kill vehicle okay mhmm there's no explosives in that thing it's literally just going to take out the warhead ideally with force so one of them is going like you know mach twenty and the i mean the the speeds at which these two moving objects hurtling through space are going is astonishing and the fact that that interception is even possible is really remarkable but it's only possible fifty percent of the time is it possible that we only know about forty four but there could be a lot more no impossible that i would be willing to bet and how well tested are these interceptors well that that's where we get the success rate that's around fifty percent because of the test right and actually the interceptor program is are you ready for this it's on strategic pause right right now meaning the interceptor missiles are there but developing them and making them more effective is on strategic pause because they can't be made more effective right people have these fantasies that we have a system like the iron dome and they see this in in current events and they're like oh our interceptors would do that it's just simply not true why why can't an iron dome like system be constructed for nuclear warheads we have systems i write about called the thaad system which is ground based and then the aegis system which is on you know vessels and these are great at shooting down some you know some rockets but they they they can only shoot them sort of one at a time you cannot shoot the mother lode as it's coming in those are the smaller systems right the tactical nuclear weapons and by the way our thaad systems are all deployed overseas and our aegis systems are all out at sea and again reporting that i was like wait what you know you have to really hunker down are we sure about this people really don't wanna believe this is an actual fact after nine eleven congress considered putting in you know aegis missiles and maybe even thaad systems along the west coast of the united states to specifically deal with the threats against nuclear armed north korea but it hasn't done so yet and again you have to ask yourself wait a minute this is insanity you know one nuclear weapon gets by any of these systems and it's full out nuclear warfare so that's not the solution more nuclear weapons is not the solution i'm looking for a hopeful thing here about north korea how many deployed nuclear warheads does north korea have so does the current system with the as we described it the interceptors and so on have a hope against the north korean attack the one that you mentioned people are worried about so they north korea has fifty let's say fifty nuclear weapons right now some ngos put it at more than a hundred it's it's impossible to know because north korea's nuclear weapons program has no transparency they're the only nuclear armed nation that doesn't announce when they do a ballistic missile test everyone else does no one wants to start a nuclear war by accident right so if russia's gonna launch an icbm they tell us if we're gonna launch one and i'm i'm talking test runs here you know with the dummy warhead we we tell them not north korea that's a fact okay so we're constantly up against the fear of north korea in this scenario i have the incoming north korean one megaton you know weapon coming in and the interceptor system tries to shoot it down so there there's not enough time and this by the way i ran through by all you know generals from the pentagon who run these scenarios for norad right and confirmed all of this as fact this is not this is this is this is the situation right so in the scenario i have the nuclear icbm coming in the interceptor missiles try to shoot down the warhead the capability is is not like what's called shoot you know and look they can't there's not enough time to go like and we're gonna try to get it we missed it okay let's go for another one so you have to go right so in my scenario we fire off four which is about what i was told would one to four because you're worried about the next one that's gonna come in you're gonna use up ten percent of your missile force of your interceptor force on one and all four miss and that's totally plausible right how likely are mistakes accidents false alarms taken as real all this kind of stuff in this picture so like you've we've kind of assumed the detection works correctly how likely is it possible like anywhere you you describe this long chain of events that can happen how possible is it just to make a mistake a stupid human mistake along the way there have been at least six known like absolute like like oh my god close calls how how thank god this happened type scenarios one was described to me with an actual personal participant secretary former secretary of defense bill perry right and he described what happened to him in nineteen seventy nine he was not yet secretary of defense he was the deputy director of the research and engineering which is like a big job at the pentagon and it was the night watch fell on him essentially right and he gets this call in the middle of the night he's told that russia has launched not just icbms but submarine launched ballistic missiles are coming at the united states and he is about to notify the president that the six minute window has to begin when he learns it was a mistake the mistake was that there was a training tape with a nuclear war scenario right we haven't even begun to talk about the nuclear war scenarios the pentagon runs an actual vhs training tape had been incorrectly inserted into a system at the pentagon and so this nuclear launch showed up at that bunker beneath the pentagon and at the bunker beneath stratcom because they're connected as being real and then it was like oh whoops it's actually a simulation test tape and perry described to me what that was like the pause in his spirit in his mind in his heart when he realized i'm about to have to tell the president that he needs to launch nuclear weapons and he learned just in the neck of time that it was a it was an error and that's one of five examples can you speak to maybe is there any more color to the feelings he was feeling like what's your sense and given all the experts you've talked to what what can be said about the seconds that one feels once finding out that a launch has happened even if that information is a is false information for me personally that's the only firsthand story that i ever heard because it's so rare and it's so unique and most people in the national security system at least in the past have been loathed to talk about any of this right it's like the sacred oath it's taboo it's taboo to go against the system of systems that is you know making sure nuclear war never happens bill perry was one of the first people who did this and a lot of it i believe at least in my lengthy conversations with him over we had a lot of zoom calls over covid when i began reporting this and he had a lot to do with me feeling like i could write this book from a human point of view and not just from the mechanized systems because and i only lightly touch upon this because it's such a fast sweeping scenario but perry for example spent his whole life dedicated to building weapons of war only later in life to realize this is madness and he shared with me that it was that idea about one's grandchildren inheriting these nuclear arsenals and the lack of you know wisdom that comes with their origin stories right when you're involved in it in the ground up apparently it has perhaps you're a different kind of steward of these systems than if you just inherit them and they are you know pages in a manual mhmm people forget you mentioned the kind of nuclear war scenarios that the pentagon runs i'd love to what what do you know about those i mean again they are very classified right i mean it was interesting coming across inform levels of classification i didn't even know existed like eci for example is exceptionally controlled information right but the pentagon war nuclear war gaming scenarios they're almost all still classified one of them was declassified recently if you can call it that i show an image of it in the book and it's just basically like almost all almost entirely redacted and then like there'll be a date you know or it'll say like phase one and that one was called proud prophet but what was incredible about the declassification process of that is it allowed allowed a couple of people who were there to talk about it okay and that's why we have that information and i write about proud prophet in the book because it was super significant in many ways one it was happening right in nineteen eighty three there was an it was an insane moment in nuclear arsenals there were sixty thousand nuclear weapons right now there's twelve thousand five hundred so we've come a long way baby right in terms of disarmament but there were sixty thousand and by the way that was not the ultimate high the ultimate high was seventy thousand okay this is insane and ronald reagan was president and he orders this war game called proud prophet and you know this everyone everyone that mattered was involved they were running the war game scenarios and what we learned from his declassification is that no matter how nuclear war starts there was a bunch of different scenarios with you know nato involved without nato with the all different scenarios no matter how nuclear war starts it ends in armageddon it ends with everyone dead i mean this is shocking when you think about that coupled with the idea that all that has been done in the forty some odd years since is okay this let's just really lean in even harder to this theoretical phenomena of deterrence because that's all it is it's just a statement lex like deterrence will hold mhmm okay well what if it doesn't well we know from proud profit what happens if it doesn't almost always so there's no mechanisms in the human mind in the human soul that stops it in the in the governments they've created it just keep the the procedure escalates always i mean here's a crazy nomenclature jargon thing for you ready escalate to deescalate that's what comes out of it think about what what i just said escalate to deescalate okay so someone strikes you with a nuclear weapon you're gonna escalate it right general hyten recently said he was stratcom commander you know if he he was sort of saber rattling with north korea during covid and he said they need to know if if they launch one nuclear weapon we launch one if they launch two we launch two but it's actually more than that they launch one we launch eighty yeah okay that's called escalate to deescalate like pound the you know what out of them to get them to stop but the i mean there is to make a case for that there is a reason to the madness because you want to threaten this gigantic response but when it comes to it the seconds before there is still a probability that you'll pull back which brings us to the most terrifying facts that i learned in all of that and that that has to do with errors right not just not errors of like we spoke about a minute ago with an you know a simulation test tape i'm talking about if one new one madman one nihilistic madman were to launch and we needed to escalate to deescalate we needed to send nuclear weapons at let's say north korea as i do in my scenario well what is completely unknown to ninety eight percent of the planet is that not only do the russians have a very flawed satellite system so that they cannot interpret what is happening properly but there is a absolutely existential flaw in the system which secretary of defense leon panetta confirmed with me which is that our icbms do not have enough range if they're if we launch a counterattack against say north korea our icbms must fly over russia they must fly over russia so imagine saying oh no no these eighty two you know warheads that are gonna actually hit the strike the northern korean peninsula are not coming for you russia our adversary right now that we're sort of saber rattling with just trust us and that is where nuclear war unfolds into armageddon and that hole in national security is shocking and as panetta told me no one wants to discuss it and if one nuclear weapon does reach its target i presume communication breaks down completely or like there's a high risk of breakdown of communication well let's back up we are both presumptuous to assume that communication could even happen prior to and let me give you a very specific example during the ukraine war okay if perhaps you remember i think it was in november of twenty twenty two news reports erroneously stated that a russian rocket a russian missile had hit poland a nato country right it turned out to be a mistake but for several hours this was actually the information that was all over the news breaking news okay thirty six hours later the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general mark milley gave a press conference and talked about this and admitted that he could not reach his russian counterpart during those thirty six hours he could not reach him how are you going to not have an absolute armageddon like furor with nuclear weapons in the air if people can't get on the phone during a ground war i i'd like to believe that there's people in major nations that don't give a damn about the bullshit of politics and can always just pick up the phone sort of very close to the top but not at the very top and just cut through the bullshit of it in situations like this i hope that's true i doubt it is and let me tell you why most and you neither you nor i are political from what i gather right so i just write about potus president of the united states i don't you have no idea what my politics are because they shouldn't matter no one should be for nuclear war or no one should be for nuclear you know national insecurity yes you wanna have a strong nation but once you get into politics then you're talking about sycophants and the more a political leader becomes divisive becomes polemic it the more his platform is predicated on hating the other side either of it within his own country or with enemy alleged enemy nations the more you surround yourself as we see in the current day with sycophants with people who will tell you not only what they think you wanna hear but will will help them to hold on to power so you don't have wise decision makers long gone are the days where we had presidents who had advisers on both sides of the aisle that's really important because you wanna you wanna have differing opinions but as things become more viperous both here in the united states and in nuclear armed nations all bets are off at whether your advisers are gonna give you good advice who are the people around the president of the united states that give advice in this six minute window how many of them just to maybe you could speak to the detail of that but also to the spirit of the way they see the world how many of them are warmongers how many of them are kinda big picture peace humanity type of thinkers well again we're talking about that six minute window so it's not exactly like you can let me put a pot of coffee on and really tell me what you think and we can strategize here right you have your secdef and your chairman maybe the vice chairman and okay we haven't even begun to talk about the fact that at the same time these advisers also have an a parallel concern and that's called continuity of government okay so while they're trying to advise on the nuclear counter strike in response to the incoming nuclear missile they have to be thinking how are we gonna keep the government functioning when the missiles start hitting when the bombs start going off and that is about getting yourself out of the pentagon let's say getting yourself to one of these nuclear bunkers that i write about at length in the book so how much can you ask of a human right because it comes down to a human secretary of defense is a human and and imagine that job while trying to advise the president and then there's also a really interesting term which i learned about called jamming the president which is often understood in washington that the military advisers would we don't know if this is legit we've never seen it put to the test but jamming the president means the military advisers are gonna push for a really aggressive counterattack immediately mhmm and again you're the president who's not really been paying attention to this because he has many other things to deal with speed is not conducive to wisdom can you speak to the jamming the president so your sense is the advisers would by default be pushing for aggressive counter attack that is a term in sort of the national security nuclear command and control historical documentation that many of the people that you might call the more dovish type people are you know worried about that the more hawkish people are going to the military advisers yeah right are gonna are gonna be jamming the president to make these decisions about which targets not if right but which targets the argument will be about which targets not about if yes i i hope that even the warmongers would at this moment because what underlies the idea of you wanting to go to war it's it's power it's like wanting to destroy the enemy and be the the the big kid on the block but with nuclear war it just feels like that falls apart do do you think warmongers actually believe they can win a nuclear war well you've raised a really important question that we look to the historical record for that answer right because astonishingly all of this began like when when russia first got the bomb in nineteen forty nine the powers that be and i write about them in the book as in a setup to the first you know for the moment of launch right like it's called how we got here right and you see and i cite you know declassified documents from some of these early meetings where nuclear war plans were being laid out and absolutely back in the nineteen fifties the the generals and the admirals that were running the nuclear command and control system believed that we could fight and win a nuclear war despite hundreds of millions of people dying this was the prevailing thought and only over time did did the did the kind of concept come into play that no we can we can never have a nuclear war it's the famous gorbachev and reagan joint statement a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought but before that many people bel believed that it could be won and they were preparing for that not to be political and not to be ageist but do cognitive abilities and all that kind of stuff come into play here so if so much is riding on the president is there tests that are conducted is there regular training procedures on the president that you're aware of do you know i don't think that has anything to do with ageism i think it has to do with i think it's an earnest question a really powerful one and if people were to ask that question of themselves or their sort of you know dinner party guests or their family around the dinner table guests you might come to a real good conclusion about how bad our political system is and how bad our presidential candidates are because why on earth there would be two candidates one of whom has cognitive problems and the other of whom has judgment problems these are the two biggest issues with a nuclear launch judgment and cognition and so where's the you know young ish thoughtful forward looking wise dedicated civil servant running for president i know that sounds you know fantastical but i wish it weren't so that's one of the things that you really think about when voting for president is this scenario that we've been describing these six minutes imagine the man or woman sitting there six minutes waiting for the pot of coffee but i think about that issue with with any with any war right i mean prior to writing nuclear war scenario i previously wrote six books on military and intelligence programs designed to prevent nuclear war and i believe the president as commander in chief should be of the highest character possible because the the programs the wars that's that we have fought since world war two have all been you know how many octogenarian sources have i interviewed i'm talking about nobel laureates and weapons designer and spy pilots and engineers in general they've all said to me with great pride you know we prevented world war three nuclear world war three right and that but that idea that the commander in chief and everyone in the in within the national security apparatus should be making really good decisions about about war it's the oldest cliche in the world that you know the the wars are fought by the young kids and that is it's not a cliche it's true and so the character part about the president should be in play whether we're thinking about nuclear war or any war in my opinion well i agree with you first of all but it feels like when nuclear war one person becomes like exponentially more important with regular war the decision to go to war or not advisers start mattering more there's judgment issues you could start to make arguments for sort of more leeway in terms of what kind of people we elect it seems like with nuclear war there's no leeway it's like one mhmm person can resist this the jamming the president force the the warmongers the use the like all the calculation involved in considering what are the errors the mistakes the missiles flying over russia the full dynamics of the geopolitics going on in the world consider all of humanity the history of humanity the future of humanity all the you're loved all all of it just loaded in to make decision then it becomes much more important that your cognitive abilities are strong and your judgment abilities against against powerful wise people just as a human being are strong so i think that's something to really really consider when you vote for president but to which degree is it really on the president versus to the people advising oh no it's on the president the president has to make the call and that six minute window happens so fast i mean the president is gonna be being moved for part of that time the secret service is gonna be you know up against up against stratcom stratcom saying we need launch you know we need the launch orders and the secret service is gonna be saying we need to move the president so it's not as much that he's delegating the issues it's more like the issue is being postponed because there is only one issue for the president to say these targets you know for him to choose from the denny's like menu okay this is what we're gonna go with and then this astonishing thing happens the president pulls you know takes out his wallet he has a card in it that's colloquially called the biscuit and that card with the codes matches up an item in the the briefcase in the in the football that then is received by an officer underneath the bunk underneath the pentagon in that bunker it's a call and response lex it's like you know alpha zeta right that's it and that then back so that the individual in the bunker realizes they are getting the command from the president and then that order is passed to stratcom and stratcom the commander of stratcom and i interviewed a former strip commander of stratcom commander of stratcom then follows orders which is he delivers the launch orders to the nuclear triad and what's done is done what would you do if you were the commander of stratcom in that situation what would you do because i i like my gut reaction right now if you just throw me in there i would refuse orders okay so good question i asked that exact question to one of my very helpful sources on the book doctor glenn mcduff who is at los alamos and who for a while was the classified they have a a museum that's classified within the lab and he was the historian in charge of it right so he's a nuclear weapons engineer he worked on star wars during the reagan era and and he does a lot having to do with the history of los alamos and the by the way the oppenheimer movie really because i've reported on nuclear weapons for you know twelve years now and oppenheimer movie had a very to me positive impact on los alamos' transparency with people like me they had a real willingness to share information i think before perhaps they were on their heels feeling they needed to be on the defensive but now they're much more forthcoming they were super helpful i can tell you the origin story of the football which they declassified for the book but i asked this question to doctor glenn mcduff right like in a different manner i said is there a chance that the stratcom commander would defy orders and he said annie you have a better chance winning powerball why do you think what's his intuition behind that you don't wind up as stratcom commander unless you are someone who follows orders you follow orders you don't think there's a deep humanity there that because his his intuition is about everything we know so far but this situation has never happened in the history of earth well this is trick and alright so you're raising a really tricky interesting conundrum here because during covid when president trump and the leader of north korea were kind of locked in various relationships with one another good bad threatening nonthreatening friendly just bananas you might say like not presidential behavior if you were someone watching c span like i do nerding out on what stratcom was actually saying about all this you noticed that stratcom commanders were speaking out publicly to congress more so than ever i had ever seen before and this issue came up would you defy presidential orders so the caveat i would say to mcduff's answer of easier to win win the powerball right is that if the commander of stratcom interpreted the president's behavior to be unreliable to be non presidential then dot dot dot but now you're into some really radical territory well i mean fundamentally it feels like just looking at all the presidents of the united states in my lifetime it feels like none of them are qualified for this six minutes so like i could see you know i i could i could see as being the commander of strathcon and being like this guy like basically respecting no president i i know you're supposed to the commander in chief but in this situation saying like i mean everybody bush obama trump biden if i was a commander of stratcom i'd be like this what does this guy know about any of this it i would defy orders i mean in this situation when the the the the the future of human civilization hangs in the balance i mean to be the person that says yes launch it's no matter what i just can't see a human being on earth being able to do that in the united states of america that's a hell of a decision like this is it that's it well but now you've raised a great important you know presentation essentially because what you're saying is people be aware right be aware of like why you're voting or why certain individuals are being escalated to even being able to run for president what does that mean why are people in america not more involved as citizens do we have a responsibility for that because you've opened up the door for people to understand okay the ultimate thing is the is the nuclear launch decision so if a person can't be trusted with that you know everything spiral everything unravels from there also i wanna look up who's the commander of stratcom now speaking of which you've interviewed a lot of experts for this book is there some commonalities about the way you've talked about this a little bit but in in the way they see this whole situation what what like scares them the most about this whole system and the whole possibility of nuclear war i first learned about nuclear weapons from a guy called al o'donnell who appears in my earlier books because i interviewed him for over a period of four and a half years because he was an engineer who actually wired nuclear bombs in the nineteen fifties he was a member of the manhattan project in nineteen forty six worked on operation crossroads the first explosions of nuclear bombs after the war ended after world war two ended and went on to arm wire and fire a hundred and eighty six out of the two hundred some odd atmospheric nuclear tests that the united states did before this was banned and so i learned from him the power of these weapons right and i learned from him this very almost nationalistic idea about how important it was to have nuclear weapons and while i learned a lot about his human side i also saw saw the side of him that was very cold war warrior right and then so he was kind of the first and then i don't know there have been a hundred people that have been directly involved in nuclear weapons along the way billy waugh who was my subject of my main my main sort of central figure in a book i wrote about the cia's paramilitary called surprise kill vanish and while halo jumped a tactical nuclear weapon into the nevada test site with a small team almost unknown to anyone right only recently declassified and so his position was like tactical nuclear weapons may end up being used so i'm trying to speak here to the scope of different people i have interviewed over over the years right and what has happened is as as we're as i've gotten closer to the present day you know in arrears there seems to be a growing movement from some of these cold warriors off the position of nuclear weapons make us great and strong toward something must be done to reduce this threat how much do you know in the same way that you know about the united states how much do you know about the russian side maybe the chinese side india and pakistan that all all of this like what how their thinking differs perhaps yes well for that you you wanna go to the experts right so in for russia for example there's a guy called pavel podvig who is probably the west's top expert on russian nuclear forces he works in parallel with the un he also studied in moscow and he interviewed so my information comes from him right like you do all the footwork to know what questions to ask and then you take the very specific questions to him and i learned from him about how the russian command and control goes down and it's very similar to ours because america and russia have been at sort of nuclear dueling with one another for seventy five years now and so everything we have they have right with the exception of we have a great satellite system and they have a super flawed one theirs is called tundra and even pavel podvig admitted that there are serious flaws in tundra the russian satellite system for example can mistake sunlight for flames can mistake clouds for a nuclear launch this is a fact okay and you know what was interesting in interviewing him was also this recent very very dangerous shift in nuclear russian nuclear policy which is this many russian experts will tell you that russia has always maintained that it never had a launch on warning policy now i don't know if i believe that's true but i'm just telling you what they say and this is coming from the generals the cold war generals in soviet russia saying oh no no no we would wait they were kind of playing the noble warrior we would wait to absorb a nuclear attack until we launched okay so many americans you know experts will tell you that that's just posturing and propaganda mhmm but that was their official position and that changed just two years ago when putin gave a speech and he said that their position had changed that they will no longer wait to absorb an attack that they once they learn of how did he phrase it he called it like the the the trajectory of the missiles right which is a way of of talking about parity the same way we see the missile coming over in mid course putin made that same statement and said we would launch what do you know of the way putin thinks about nuclear weapons and nuclear war is it just something to allude to in a speech or do you think he contemplates the possibilities of nuclear war i don't know but if i had to guess it would go like this i would look at his background and he comes from the intelligence world right so my experience in interviewing old timers who have spent decades working for the cia or even nro or nsa i know the way they think from having spent hundreds of hours interviewing them right and then i know the way that you know military men think and it's very different right so putin's not a military person per se he's an intelligence officer so what con would concern me there if i had to guess about his mindset has to do with paranoia right most intelligence officers must have a degree of healthy paranoia or they're gonna wind up dead right and so that's not a great quality to have you would be more trigger happy perhaps so you're more you would be more prone to respond to erroneous signals and and you'd be suspicious and you can see that now there's a such a you know incredible distrust and and and sort of real conflict between russia between its leader and nato between its leader and all of the west and then that is fueled by his closest advisers kind of you know seem they seem to be from the statements they have made that i've read in translation they seem to be fostering that same idea that you know nato really has it in for russia the america really has it in and that is so dangerous and disheartening and perhaps makes it less likely that the president would pick up the phone and talk to the other president and or that the close advisers near the president would make that happen you were talking about the procedure with the football is there any concern for cyberattacks for sort of security concerns of at at at every level here false signals errors shutting down the the channels of communication through cyberattacks all that kind of stuff so to answer those questions i interviewed a number of people but most specifically general tuhill who was obama's cyber chief and he was actually america's first cyber chief and the nuclear command and control system and really the triad functions on on analog systems they've it functions on old school systems if there's not digital interface you can't hack into it right so most of the issues that i raise in the book have to do with what happens to cyber after a nuclear attack right what happens to cyber in the minutes after a bomb a nuclear weapon strikes america and how that impacts the ability for people to communicate with one another and that's when chaos takes control well let let's talk about it i so god forbid if a nuclear weapon reaches its target what happens what perhaps you could say what you think would be the first target hit would it be the pentagon i was told by many people i interviewed that the biggest fear in washington dc is what's called a bolt out of the blue attack that's an unwarned nuclear attack against washington dc the target would be the pentagon and that's what i begin the scenario with you know and i reported in graphic horrifying detail what happens because i don't know what's worse me writing that all out or the fact that it's all documented by the defense department i mean they have been documenting the effect of nuclear weapons on people and animals and things since the earliest days of the cold war and all of the details i pull are from these documents like the effects of nuclear weapons and again this document was the original information the original data in this document come from hiroshima and nagasaki right it was all classified and then it was built upon by those two hundred some odd atmospheric nuclear weapons test we did and you know we're talking about like millimeters and inches we're talking about the defense department knowing that oh seven and a half miles out the upholstery on cars will spontaneously combust the pine needles will catch on fire they will start more fires you know you have all kinds of mayhem and chaos happening based on reported facts from observations and this is really shocking and grotesque at the same time so one warhead reaches the pentagon everybody in the pentagon perishes a hundred and eighty million degrees the fireball on a one megaton nuclear weapon is nineteen football fields of fire think about that nothing remains nothing remains and there's then a radius where people die immediately and then there's people that are dead when found and then there's people that will die slowly yes necentric rings and again rings defined by defense scientists but before that you know the bomb goes off then there's this blast wave that's like several hundred miles an hour pushing out like a bulldozer knocking everything down bridges buildings i mean you can read fema manuals about what the rubble will be like you're talking about thirty feet deep rubble as the buildings go over six seven eight ten miles out that speaks nothing of the mega fires that will then ensue so once all these people die and third degree radiation burns burns did you even know there was such a thing as fourth degree radiation burns right we're talking about the wind ripping the skin off people's faces many miles out and then you have a meg a sucking action right everyone is or many people are familiar with what the nuclear mushroom cloud looks like and its stem is actually creates and again this is from you know physicists who advise the defense department on this the sucking up into the nuclear stem three hundred mile an hour winds you're talking about people miles out getting sucked up into that stem when you see the mushroom cloud lex that is in a nuclear war that would be people those are like the remnants of people and of things in the cloud thirty forty mile wide mushroom cloud blocking out the sun and that speaks nothing of the radiation poisoning that follows and then the power grid goes out basically everything we rely on in terms of systems in our way of life goes out you write quote those who somehow managed to escape death by the initial blast shockwave and firestorm suddenly realize an insidious truth about nuclear war that they're entirely on their own here begins a quote fight for food and water i mean that is a wake up call on top of a wake up call that we go back to a kind of primitive fight for survival each on their own and by the way those details were given to me by obama's fema director craig fugate who was in charge of so fema is the agency in america that plans for nuclear war okay and what fugate said to me was you know annie we plan for asteroid strikes these are called low probability but high consequence events and fema is the organization that you know when there's a hurricane or an earthquake or a flood fema steps in and they do what's called population protection planning right they take care of people and what fugue told me is after a nuclear strike after a bolt out of the blue attack he used those terms there is no population protection everyone's dead right and he means that metaphorically but also kind of more literally because he just said at that point you just hope that you stalked pedialyte what do you think happens to humans like how does human nature manifest itself in such conditions do you think like brutality will come out like people will just for survival will steal will murder will i can't imagine that not happening i think that's why people love post apocalyptic television shows and films because they see that and then of course there's always one great charismatic person who's trying to restore morality and these are great narratives that people like to tell themselves in the world of science fiction but what we're dealing with is science fact in this scenario and and it is meant to terrify people into realizing wait a minute this is a conversation that absolutely should be have had while it can still be had because the reality is when you have the director of fema telling you this it's a real wake up call and by the way craig fugate was so transparently human with me and i quote him directly in the book but he spoke about you asked me earlier about like what would be going through the president's mind and we don't know i don't know but craig fugate told me what would be going through his mind and he said along the lines i'm paraphrasing like it's almost something you couldn't even comprehend you would it would just like ruin you you know his words are really powerful and of course the fema director in the scenario is notified in that first window while the launch you know while the ballistic missile is on its way and no one in america yet knows and i have the fema director pull over to the side of the road and jump in a helicopter that's sent for him to take him to the bunker that fema goes to which is called mount weather and so he's aware that fugate was aware that as fema director you would likely be taken to a safe place however many hours you're gonna be safe or days or maybe weeks or maybe months but as i also learned from the cyber people i interviewed that you know there's a complete fallacy that these military bases can continue functioning they run on diesel fuel and when the fuel stops pumping there's no more generators electricity is gone communication lines are all gone the food supply all of it the all the supply chain is gone it's terrifying and that's just in the first few days first few hours in part five you described the twenty four months and beyond after this first hour we've been talking about so what happens to earth what happens to humans mhmm if a full on nuclear war happens mhmm so for that i was super privileged to talk to professor brian toon who is one of the original five authors of the nuclear winter theory and the that theory was developed in was published in nineteen in the early nineteen eighties one of professor toon's professors was carl sagan who is sort of the most famous auth author of the nuclear winter theory and you know there were all kinds of controversies about it when it came out including the defense department saying it was soviet propaganda which it wasn't and what the nuclear winter author authors conceded back in the eighties was that their modeling was just the best it could be based on what they had at the time and so now flash forward to where we are in twenty twenty four and talking to professor toon who's been working on this issue for all these decades since he shared with me how the climate models today with the systems we have the computer systems reveal that actually nuclear winter is worse right so to answer your questions the bombs stopped falling in my scenario seventy two minutes after they first launched the bomb stopped falling and then the mega fires begin each nuclear weapon will have according to the defense department a megafire that will burn between a hundred and three hundred square miles so a thousand weapons fifteen hundred weapons think about those megafires everything is burning forests cities think about the pyrotox in all the cities you know high rises burning and all of this soot gets lofted into the air according to toon some three hundred billion pounds of soot and what happens it blocks out the sun and without sun we have nuclear winter we have a situation whereby ice sheets form you're talking about bodies of water in places like iowa being frozen for ten years so temperature drops temperature plummets right and there are all kinds of papers that have been written about this using modern calculate you know systems and the numbers vary but the bottom line is agriculture fails mhmm foods obviously dies so agriculture system completely shuts down so the food sources shut down so there's no food there's no sun temperature drops completely no electricity and we haven't even spoken of radiation poisoning because you know the radiation poisoning kills many people in the aftermath of the nuclear the nuclear exchange but after the nuclear freeze ends after nuclear winter you know after the sun starts to come back let's say eight nine ten years now you have no ozone layer or you have a severely depleted ozone layer and so the sun's rays are now poisonous so you have people living underground and you have this great thawing and with that great thawing comes pathogens and plague and you have this you know system where the small bodied animals the insects and whatnot begin reproducing really fast and the larger bodied animals like you and me begin to go extinct professor toon said it to me this way you know he said sixty six million years ago an asteroid hit earth killed all the dinosaurs and wiped out seventy percent of the species and nuclear war would likely do the same and so here we are talking about this because there is a difference there's nothing you can do about an asteroid but there is something you can do about a nuclear war do you think it's possible that some humans will survive all of this so if we look i mean how long would it be would it be decades would it be centuries before the you start to have the earth starts to have the capacity to grow food again carl sagan talked about that in his this amazing book that he wrote with two scientist colleagues called the cold and the dark and they have there's a bunch of essays about exactly this right like how what would happen and how long would it take it's really interesting it's dated you know it's from the eighties but man is it shocking and you think about that where okay so men return to sort of the worst most base versions of themselves civilization is gone right meaning you know civil society there's no rule of law it's just fend for yourself there's you know people fighting over what little resources there are man returns to a hunter gatherer state and to really think about this idea i looked at the oldest known archaeological site in the world in turkey which is called gobekli tepe and it's really fascinating to me because i interviewed one of the two archaeologists who first found this site in the early nineties and the lead archaeologist was a a guy named klaus schmidt and michael morsch was the young graduate student who was with him and morsch's description of like coming upon this like rumored to be site there was something called a wishing tree on the site which i just found so human and perfect that it was this magical place and it was locatable because there was a wishing tree on a hill and it's where people went to wish and to hope that their wishes came true i mean how human is that right and that is where beneath the wishing tree kind of like in the shadow of the wishing tree there was a tepe which is a hill and beneath that there is the oldest known civilization in the world twelve thousand years ago a group of hunter gatherers built this site why we don't know but i imagined when through morsch's descriptions of coming upon like you know he tripped on a rock he told me right he tripped over a stone that turned out to be the the top part of a twelve thousand year old sculpted man giant pillar right and he talked about coming upon that and then no one knows really what gobekli tepe was for and that makes my mind try and answer your the question you asked me internally right just as like a human who's here on earth for the amount of time i'm here like if there were a nuclear war what would it be like what it what would it be like when someone in the future some or or would we become archaeologists one day would civilization rebuild would we develop computers who knows it's interesting to think about i hope we never have to what would we remember about this time right it is terrifying to think that most of it will be forgotten everything we kind of assume will not be forgotten we think maybe some of the technological developments will be forgotten but we assume like some of history won't be forgotten but realistically especially the us descending into primitive survival probably everything since the industrial age will be forgotten like everything maybe some religious ideas will persist some stories and myths will persist but like all the wisdom we've gathered higher level sort of technological wisdom would be gone like that's terrifying to think about and like maybe even as as you touch on the very fact of nuclear war might be forgotten like the lessons of nuclear war might be forgotten that there are these weapons sort of the obvious elephant in the room would be one of the things that's completely forgotten or become so vague in the recollection of humans that our understanding will change it's almost as if a god descended on earth and destroyed everything maybe that's how it'll persist sort of like mythological interpretation of what nuclear weapons are that's terrifying because then it it it could repeat again mhmm but i think for me the idea of the what is buried becomes very interesting and very human and the and in a strange way optimistic and positive because if you can visualize that wishing tree and i have a picture of it in the book from one of the archaeologists who work on that right you you think what were they wishing what were they wishing for right and then you think of your own self what do i wish for in this world right because you know i do think all things come from what happens you know metaphorically around the dinner table right like what people put their eyes on mhmm becomes interesting and expands what people talk about and ultimately when you think about the long arc of time and human civilization it does kind of make you wanna communicate more with your enemies with your adversaries and you know i think about the quote what einstein is said to have said which is that he was asked what weapons world war three would be fought with and he said i don't know but i know that world war four will be fought with sticks and stones let me ask you about the great filter when you look up into our galaxy into our universe look up at the sky do you think there's other alien civilizations that are contending with some similar questions and perhaps the reason we have not definitively seen alien civilizations is because the others have failed to find a solution to this great filter something like nuclear weapons i'm not sure i'm gonna have to think about that question but what i what does come to mind is an answer that was given to me similarly right by a man by ed mitchell who went to the moon right and he was the sixth man to walk on the moon and so his opinion i think might count a little more than mine on that subject because his lens is so much greater right and mitchell was vilified when he got back from the moon because it became known that he believed in things like extrasensory perception and this kind of mystical metaphysical way of looking at the world and he he really suffered from that i mean he was ridiculed and he lost a lot of his career and his friends but what he said to me in our interview about his trip home from the moon answers that great filter question i think in an in a way i might wanna adopt right which is which is this that he said that as they were returning from the moon to earth he looked down at the earth and and i'm paraphrasing him i write all this in in phenomena an earlier book but he's the the paraphrasing is that he looked down from the earth and he's and it was nineteen seventy one and he thought about all the conflict going on down below particularly the vietnam war where many of his friends were and then he looked behind him into the great vast galaxy and he had a moment he says that was like an epiphany like not a near death experience but a sort of near life experience right where he believed that the human consciousness which is where so much of this thoughtfulness about metaphysics and esp perhaps come from mitchell's theory was that human consciousness the the the way to understand it was had something to do with realizing that man's inner life and man's outer life are deeply connected in the same way that man is connected to the galaxy and he said it much more eloquently but you kinda get the idea that and i think it's why humans have always loved to look up right that that there's more there and it's a bit like the wish it's like the it's like the big version of the wishing tree you know what do i wish for for myself and what is maybe perhaps the the realignment of thinking for those of us in search of happiness right and rather instead of war is you know what does it mean to have a conscience to have consciousness what does it mean to be a thinking person what does it mean to be on this earth to born to be born to live to die and then there is legacy and so all of those ideas are i think foster the kind of conversation that would that deescalates conflict mhmm yeah so in in some deep way so the mysteries of what's out there when we look out to the stars are the same mysteries that we find in when trying to understand the human mind and they're they're coupled in some way for me thinking about alien civilizations out there is really the same kind of question which is what what are we what is this what what are we doing here how do we come here why does it seem to be so magical and beautiful and powerful where is it going because it feels like we're really perhaps the first time in history are in a moment where we can destroy ourselves and so naturally you ask well where's others like us is is it perhaps are we inevitably going to a place where we'll destroy ourselves ourselves is it basically inevitable that we destroy ourselves we become too powerful and insufficiently wise to know what to do with that power but like you said probably the answers to that are in here we don't need to look out there i'd love to ask you about the extrasensory perception you've written like you said the book phenomena on the secret history of the us government's investigations into extrasensory perception and psychokinesis what are some of the more interesting extrasensory abilities that were explored by the government and maybe just in general esp what is it what what do you know of it the book was so interesting to report because i spend so much time dealing with like mechanized systems machines war machines mhmm and yet the military and intelligence were and continue to be incredibly interested in the human mind in consciousness and so you know if one is called hard science this what we're talking about now is called squishy science right and it was really interesting to delve into that world it just couldn't be farther from from weapons and war or could it right and then i really began thinking well before science and technology sort of the supernatural ruled the world you know the oracle of delphi in greece exists for the you know pre before the common error rulers to go and beg to learn from the powers that be what was going to happen right so all esp programs i think pull from that origin story right the the leaders' desire to know and so i really found it amazing that many people think these systems or rather these programs started in the seventies i learned they actually began right after world war two and that was because and here you know in my reporting i find all things sort of always circle back to the third reich to the nazis the nazis had a massive occult program an esp program psychokinesis program astrology both hitler and himmler were deeply interested in these occult concepts and after i learned from records at the national archives that after the war you know half of everything went to the soviet union and i'm talking about the trove of nazi documents from which the superpowers were then going to learn to fight future wars and half of them went to the united states and so we got this trove of documents about all of this and the soviets got the other and so it set off a kind of psychic arms race which in a weird way paralleled the nuclear arms race which we've been talking about in as much that it led one side to constantly wonder what the other side had mhmm have they been able to find anything interesting in this squishy science analysis of trying to see how the human mind could be used as a weapon the cia most definitely believed from from my reading of the documents that there was something very legit shall we say about esp it couldn't was uncontrollable it was unreliable but nonetheless it existed and the and being the intelligence agency that they are they cared less about why it worked they just wanted to know how they could use it and then it got into all kinds of elements of placebo effect and this you know and you know when the military stepped in and got involved in the programs that was a complete disaster in my opinion because the military needs to control everything in a mechanized systematic way and so they started for example teaching people to be psychic which is a really really really bad idea i mean and you know flash forward to where we are today these programs still exist there's a navy program which is working on based on a lot of data that came back from the war on terror with certain soldiers knowing you know wait don't walk down that path there is an ied there mhmm and they call this the spidey sense and they actually have a program that works from this so these things never go away they kind of circle around in terms of you know being made fun of and then taken seriously and a little of this and of that my biggest takeaway from writing that book was a quote that i that i referenced in the beginning which is the the thomas theorem and it says if men define situations as real they are real in their consequences yeah i mean placebo as you've mentioned is a fascinating concept by the way a short plug i started listening to it andrew huberman just released a podcast on placebo the placebo effect does he know the origin story of placebo we'll have to ask him we'll have to ask you ready for this yes cia okay and not only that i can tell you that doctor henry beecher mhmm harvard i think he was also at mit for a bit he came up with that term and you might even say for the cia does that trouble you that so much of this is coming from the cia first you mean the placebo concept or the the placebo concept but a lot of the sort of scientific investigations listen i have such mixed feelings about the cia as one should i think you should have mixed feelings about anything that you cover as a reporter or as a human because and maybe change that from mixed to you know conflicting right because there are there are really positive elements of every organization within the federal government i mean my first learning about the cia came from the work i did on the area fifty one book about their aerial reconnaissance programs which were set up again to prevent world war three right mhmm nuclear world war three it was this idea that information was king the u two spy paint was developed out at air at area fifty one and i interviewed hervey stockman the first man to fly over the soviet union in a u two gathered all this intelligence prevented wars later i wrote a book about the cia's paramilitary mhmm surprise kill vanish so like just when i was thinking wow the cia is doing all this amazing you know non kinetic activity with aerial reconnaissance then you learn about their kill programs and that's a whole different set of issues it turns out as you write in that book that the cia assassinates people sometimes and we'll talk about it but anyway like you said conflicting feelings mhmm i mean i work with sources to report my books and so put yourself in my shoes right i interview for dozens or hundreds of hours my primary sources in the case of of the surprise kilvanished book i traveled with billy waugh the longest serving cia operator back to the scene of the crime you know back to the battle we went to hanoi we went to havana and you really get to know someone and that's when i say conflicting you know i work with sources on a real trust basis right and sometimes people will tell me things they'll say annie this is this is off the record this is for you to know about me on deep background because i want you to know who i am and that's powerful and they a lot of times it's personal right it's personal it's about their personal life and they don't want that and and it it isn't apropos to what i'm writing about but i need to know that and that's where it gets conflicted because you in a good way because you realize where we're all such creatures of our personal lives right so you have a professional life where your national security are in your hands mhmm i don't know what that is like i wonder if you could just speak to that you've interviewed so many powerful people so many fascinating people and as you've spoken about trust is fundamental to that so they open up and really mhmm show you into their world what does it take to do that i think willingness we were talking about trust earlier like you have to trust that there's i have to trust that there's a reason i find myself in a certain situation right otherwise it would just be a constant you know doubt paradox right why am i here what am i doing and so i trust that i'm going to learn something of value and so i'm willing to listen i really am willing to listen right because and so far it's always proven you know my the expectations i might have going into something are dwarfed by the outcome because people are so interesting and because the people that i interview because i write about war and weapons and national security and government secrets and the people i interview are at the heart of all of this i mean they are really capable people intellectually brilliant physically capable they go so far out on the limb to do their jobs and by the way the reason they're talking to me is because they're still alive and so many of their colleagues are dead so it gives them also a wisdom about you know life about sacrifice not in cliched sort of nationalistic jingoistic terms whatsoever i'm talking like real real what is their real truth mhmm you know when i went to vietnam with billy wa i mean so much of it was the details are just you know every detail right i mean starting with the fact that he he showed up at my house with a giant suitcase and a bunch of clothes you know dry cleaning pressed clothes in plastic hangers carrying them i'm like billy we're going to vietnam and we're going back into the jungle to find the oscar eight battle site like what are you what are you carrying right and he got really mad at me to not like anyone correcting him and i got my husband on the job like kevin you gotta sort this out right and what transpired was that billy wall had never taken a trip for personal reasons he operated i think in sixty two countries every single time for the cia and it would go like this billy go to there and get to there right mhmm and that's what he would do and when he arrived they whatever he needed he would just get you know it's not a fashion trip right so he had no idea how to pack for an overseas trip this was like oh my god how can you not have the hugest smile on your face going into this i'm with a guy who's eighty nine years old he's got eight bullet you know he's got he's had eight purple hearts from vietnam right i mean he operated against osama bin laden ten years before nine eleven he went after bin laden in afghanistan when he was seventy two and he went after gaddafi during the arab spring when he was eighty two and now here he is with me going to hanoi you know the details those human details but the the my husband repacked his bag and you know like got him a proper suitcase that was carryable and small and didn't have the hangers you know he wasn't trailing the hangers but it was the it was the trip home in the taxi that i got at this really big reveal billy reached into that small suitcase my husband had given him and pulled out a rolled up american flag and he had taken this flag because i had tried to help him pack and he wouldn't let me and i just thought it was like an old guy being stubborn but he didn't want me to see that he was bringing an american flag to vietnam which is not legal and he wanted to bring that flag and take it around everywhere with him as he explained to me later to honor all of his friends who died there fifty years ago and then when the trip was finished he gave me that flag and it's in my office and that's the kind of relationship that you can develop with people as a reporter if you're willing to go the extra mile with them to trust them that they'll tell you things of value and to me something like that is as a value as as any you know secret mission i'm able to get declassified because we are a nation of people and probably there's a bunch of human details that you can't possibly express in words things left unspoken but you saw in the silence exchange between the two of you the sadness the maybe you could see anna's face looking back at memories of the people he's lost all that kind of stuff all that kind of stuff you mentioned you wrote a book on area fifty one for people who don't know you've written a lot about security the military secrets all this kind of stuff so area fifty one is one of the legendary mhmm centers of all of these kinds of topics so high level first is what is area fifty one as you understand it as you've written about the lore and the reality i think everybody wants to know about area fifty one because it kind of it's like this american enigma you know it's like to some people it's the shangri la of you know testbed aerospace programs right and to others it's the place of captured aliens right and everything in between i had the great fortune of interviewing seventy five people who lived and worked at that base for extended periods of time mostly leading up to the nineties because everything since then is classified right so things get declassified after decades not everything but some and that allows you to piece together stories so you've talked to a lot of people that work there what can you describe as the sort of the history of technological development that went on there i mean area fifty one is huge by the way and it's you know it's a secret it's a top secret military facility inside a top secret military facility inside the nevada test and training range which is this massive not secret facility right so you're just talking about layers talk about peeling the onion in reverse and it began as a place to test the u two spy plane and literally the cia set up shop there to build this plane away from the public eye and then that led to another espionage platform called the a twelve oxcart which is you know anyone who's seen the x men movies knows about the sr seventy one but bef and that's a two seater right and before that that there was the a twelve oxcart and that was the cia's stealth mach three spy plane you know think about that in the early nineteen sixties it's astonishing and i interviewed the pilots who flew it what did they say about it what what was it like god i mean you know look i i describe in detail in area fifty one but also the the amazing thing lex about that was that and you know i just look back on that with such fondness this is like in two thousand and nine when i was reporting that and all many of the guys who were in their eighties and nineties were world war two heroes like serious world war two heroes like colonel slater who was the commander of area fifty one he flew the u-two on the missions called the black cat missions over china in the early 1960s to see about their lop nur nuclear facility right so all of these things tie in when you're reporting on military and intelligence programs but the these guys had been world war two heroes and then were given this cushy job out at area fifty one you know and it just came with all these perks colonel slater told me this one perk i just love so much they all had a hankering for lobster one day right and here they are in the middle of the desert in nevada and they have these really fast planes you know and they literally called like they arranged they didn't take the ox guard out for that one but they they they would they got some lobsters from massachusetts like delivered to them in like record time they didn't even need to put them on ice you know and again those are the these details where you're like thank god at least for me thank god i got these details these guys are all passed now yeah so there's there's a lot of incredible technological work going on there so the legend the lore like you said aliens mhmm were there ever aliens in area fifty one as you understand it so i've interviewed hundreds of people that worked there in the net well not just at area fifty one but in all the different national security and military intelligence and intelligence programs and i have i personally have no reason to believe that aliens have ever visited earth that's just me personally earth period i i i have no information to that that causes me to conclude that's the case now with that said many of the primary players in this present day you know there are aliens among us narrative are in my phenomena book i continue to communicate with a lot of these people i'm talking about astrophysicists who fundamentally believe that there are aliens among us right so we beg to differ on that issue but for you in terms of doing research on government agencies that do top secret military work i mean they would know right so you have interviewed a lot of people that have at every layer of the onion you don't have a you don't you don't see evidence or a reason to believe that there was ever aliens or ufos captured from out of this world that is correct and and even perhaps more important and perhaps this colors my thinking but i am uniquely familiar with disinformation programs put forth by the cia or the agency as it's called by insiders right and i've known and i've learned firsthand about these program or rather learned from firsthand participants in strategic deception campaigns that the cia has engaged in beginning with area fifty one you know the idea that all these reports of this u two spy plane this giant long wind long winged aircraft flying seventy thousand feet up people didn't think airplanes could fly that high and it's you know the sun shining off of it it looked like a ufo and all the reports coming in and the cia opened up a ufo disinformation campaign office headed by a guy named toto otarenko you know specifically for this reason now does that mean that every ufo sighting in the world is has been a u-two no but i come from it from that lane of thinking and there are so many strategic deception campaigns and as i look over the decades of how these same ufo stories and again this is just my opinion based on my reporting this narrative that keeps reoccurring it seems to me like a very large catchall to keep the public's attention on that not on that so so to you like sexy stories like ufos are going to be leveraged by the cia for strategic deception a hundred percent i mean google paul benowitz i'm always amazed that paul benowitz's story is not more widely spoken of and i think that's because people there's like the sort of ufologists or the people who are like absolutely convinced that aliens are among us and i use that term loosely but you know what i mean and then there's the quote unquote skeptics and the skeptics tend to be sort of like self righteous and i would never wanna be self righteous so i'm not a skeptic i'm just you know agnostic i suppose but google paul benowitz and you can learn the story of that man who thought he saw a ufo in the seventies early eighties and the air force because the air force intelligence community works hand in glove with cia a lot and some of the other intelligence agencies of course they're seventeen not just the cia and they destroyed paul benowitz they sent him to a mental institution by pulling a massive strategic deception campaign against him because they didn't want him to know about the technology that he was seeing at kirkland air force base so look that up and then you go oh my god and you know to my eye you can apply any of these other names substitute in paul benowitz or any of the current individuals you know who really become convinced of x y or z when in fact there is a strategic deception campaign going on yeah there's a lot of incentive for this aa and other intelligence agencies to get you to look the other way on whatever whatever is happening plus from a enemy perspective whenever two nations are at war to try to create hysteria in the other but then you have the thomas theorem that becomes applicable there too if men define situations as real they are real in their consequences right so this idea of like ufos and we're being lied to it becomes real to many people and then that creates a whole subset of problems to the point where things are spiraling out of control and there is no there is no center anymore right so a lot of people that are briefed on programs maybe don't even aren't even aware of their position within a greater campaign or i'm wrong and there are aliens among us right so you know do you i i appreciate your the possibility of acknowledging that you might be wrong from everything you know about the us government if there was an alien spacecraft like what do you think would happen would they be able to hold on to those secrets for you know decades like would they want to hold on to those secrets like what would they do what's your sense i i can't imagine that kind of exciting situation not becoming public information right and the counter to that is this right which is this is a very strong argument for why this is a big strategic deception campaign right think about the defense department and the air think about how jealously they guard its airspace right i mean you had a chinese balloon flying over and the whole world went crazy right it was front page news so the fact that the one element or a couple people in the defense department have made this statement we've lost control of our airspace over this this ufo alleged ufo crap that they can't explain i don't buy that at all zero of course it's possible that you know it is alien spacecraft if it is that and they operate under very different set of technological capabilities in theory in my interviews with jacques vallee who is the kind of grandfather of all ufology and he's such an interesting person and has such a really unique origin story about how he came into all of this and he's such a scientist right and he is profoundly dedicated to this issue and stands completely on the opposite end of the spectrum from me and knows a lot more and has studied this for decades more but what he said to me is the most interesting thing which is that it's not a military problem it's an intelligence problem because jacques believes that this is some kind of intelligence right which really the closest i can do in to wrapping my head around that takes me to consciousness right the idea of what is consciousness and i think that's where it becomes very interesting i think the government is hiding bodies and crafts is is very paul benowitz read it google it let me do it right yeah yeah i i think this kind of flying saucer thing is is a a trivialization of what kind of if there's alien civilizations out there trivialization that's a great word trivialization that's i agree with you i tend to believe that there's like a very large number of alien civilizations out there and i i believe we we would have trouble comprehending what that even looks like were they to visit i i tend to believe they are already here have visited and we're too dumb to understand what that even means mhmm and they certainly would not appear as as flying objects that defy gravity for brief moments of time on on a low resolution video i tend to have humility about this all this kind of stuff but i think radical humility is required to even like open your eyes to what an alien intelligence would actually look like and it i to me it's beyond military applications it's like the basic human question of like what is even this thing like you mentioned consciousness that's going on like where does this come from mhmm why is it so powerful is it unique in the universe i tend to believe not of course i hang out a bunch with with other folks like elon who believe we are alone but i think that belief just like you said has power because it actually manifests itself in in reality so if you believe that we're alone in this universe that's a great motivator to build rockets and become multiplanetary and save ourselves especially in the case of nuclear war because otherwise whatever the special sauce this this flame of consciousness will go out if we destroy ourselves on this earth and for people like elon it's too high of a probability that we destroy ourselves on earth not to try to become multiplanetary in your book on area fifty one you propose an explanation that i think some people have criticized at the very end that this might have been a disinformation campaign from i guess stalin that the roswell incident was a remotely piloted plane with a quote grotesque child sized aviator just looking back at all that now years later what's the probability that it's true what's the probability it's not so you know i've never i've never revealed to that sources yes did you know that i know that me tell you with the source yeah okay what's who is the source so before i say anything on that let me let me let me speak to the the question that you asked right so you asked me what's the probability that that is still standing as an idea mhmm fourteen twelve thirteen fourteen years later right so i continued to work with that source for years afterwards we talked about this look i mean his whole family knew it was him and i knew his family because i was an integral part of you know i was at his house i met all his kids grandkids and and we should say the source is the main expert advisor behind the story that it was maybe you can explain what the story is that you report in the book that it was disinformation campaign created by stalin to cause mass hysteria in the united states yes the the very kind that we've been speaking about with the cia and so on yes predicated on the on the narrative of the war of the worlds right and the war of the worlds when it was a radio program in the united states made people go crazy oh my god we're being invaded by aliens well the government was always interested in this story and joseph stalin was too we know that from declassified documents right and so the source told me that the reason for this program and that the real roswell crash remains where in fact it was a a black propaganda hoax infiltrated you know or rather predicated at this idea that you were gonna overwhelm america's early warning air defense system cause mayhem and maybe be able to attack the united states that was the plan and stalin was also messing with the united states messing with truman who sort of you know turned his back on him right at potsdam and so this idea was and the reason that the source is important and unlike you know a lot of people i saw i i saw this i saw that i learned that was according to the source once it was once it was determined that this was a hoax and that stalin was able to get a craft over the united states and it crashed and it had you know people inside of it they were people that were sort of deformed and meant surgically altered to look like aliens the united states government decided that it needed to know what on earth that was all about and if it was possible for us to have the same program this according to the source right and so it sounds preposterous and if it was just someone saying i you might say well it's ridiculous tell me and get them onto another subject but the difference was is this source who's very well placed and friends with all of the other seventy five people you know told me this as a confession right a real tearful confession because what he said is he was involved in the american program to do the same thing and people died because there were human experiments that went on and i i write about this in the last twelve pages of area fifty one it was an explosive you know revelation and i felt very confident in writing this because the source wanted it written why because he said i'm dedicated to my country i know about being committed to national security and this kind of thing must never happen and if you give people too much power they will take advantage of it and he wanted it on the record and his wife of sixty years did not know until after the book published nor did his children okay so after the book published i was called to his house and sat there with his family and they said tell us this isn't true and he said it is true right now that source is al o'donnell who is the nuclear weapons engineer who armed wired and fired a hundred and eighty six nuclear weapons okay so if you wanna talk about something you're the first person i've told that on on the record but it's kind of about time wow well i you received a lot of criticism over this story and it confused me why because it's given the context of everything you described with the cia and other intelligence agencies it is reasonable that such a action will be taken and the source is extraordinarily credible right if you all if you wanted to take the position well that person isn't very reliable then you have to ask yourself why did they have top secret clearances that are higher than any in the the united states whatsoever because he was responsible for arming nuclear bombs he was called the trigger man and by the way he told me that i could tell the world who he was there's a lot of details that are really dark involving that program and when is it appropriate right well it feels appropriate now first of all because you and i have been talking for several hours so this is what is truly a long form conversation and it's the outcome of you know a very long time of my reporting and also being judicious about what you know closing the loop on that right because i do think it's important for people to know that sources have revelations and like you said the programs both on the soviet side and the american side conflicting i think is the the term we used previously ethically morally on all fronts are people have done some horrible things in the name of security in your book surprise kill vanish you write about the cia and the so called president's third option it turns out so first of all first option being diplomacy and second option being war so when diplomacy is inadequate and war is a terrible idea we'll go to the third option and this third option is about covert action and and it's about assassination so how much of that does the cia do that is open to debate we know from the historical record that the cia was heavily involved in assassination during the cold war that's non negotiable you know even the names of the programs that were assigned to perform assassinations are fascinating and now declassified like eisenhower's for example was the health alteration committee well we used to have a sense of humor into this dark topic you know then the more modern names are targeted killing right executive action targeted killing right mhmm i mean drone striking is essentially assassination and you know people jump up and down and say that's not true well i spent quite a long time interviewing the cia's lead counsel john rizzo he died recently rizzo was thrown rizzo was thrown under the bus by sort of the general public for he was the fall guy for the torture campaign mhmm the cia calls it enhanced interrogation and so rizzo had this long career you know he began working under the carter administration right and was responsible for the torture memos was responsible for legally making sure the president's ass was covered and then got thrown under the bus and so he was very forthcoming not in a bitter way but in a very earnest way about a lot of how these programs are made to be legal because if the president of the united states says they're legal they're legal executive order one two three three three you know it says we don't assassinate but it can be overwritten by another order that's straight out of rizzo's mouth right also really important to keep in mind is that the military operates under what's called title fifty it's part of the national security code that gives like sort of you know rules and etcetera how you must behave in a war theater well the cia is under no such rules it operates under what's called title fifty and you know it's interesting to me as a reporter because before i wrote the book and reported openly about title fifty it was not really discussed and now you even see operators themselves on podcast talking about title fifty which is kind of great because it's like the cat's out of the bad guys that's what it's called and that's how it works it means what we say goes can you elaborate on what title fifty so it basically says assassination is allowed it says what the president wants the president gets right and so i mean the best example is the killing of bin laden right we were not at war with pakistan so title fifty doesn't apply you can't have a military operation in a country you're not at war with i mean the lines my god now they've really blurred but even then they were a little more honored right and so what do you do well leon panetta was the cia director and you work out a scenario whereby the seals and by the way it wasn't the seal it was there was a rotational on that killer capture mission which is really just a kill mission seals were practicing delta was practicing and special activities division was practicing they were all practicing at a secret facility in north carolina right and it was just like you know they're ready to till they get the go order and it just happened to be the seals okay so the seals operate under title ten so they had to get what i call sheep dip because that's what the insiders call it right and that is a term that comes from interestingly area fifty one the u two pilots were air force pilots they needed to be sheep dipped over to the cia so they could do things that defied the law okay so you can see how these all entwine and you become more and more informed and you go right so that's how title fifty worked so the night of that mission that's fascinating that's fascinating so people talk about the navy seal doing it but it's really legally speaking to get the permission to do it within the whole legal framework of the united states it was the cia and if you look at their uniforms that they were wearing and now that you know this you'll see there's no nomenclature on them there's no right so those are they're just meant to be completely untraceable were that were they to be shot down and captured it's like wait who are these guys oh a bunch of rogue guys okay and this goes back the origin story of all that is in vietnam with mac v sog and these cross border operations that i chronicle in surprise kill vanish which still amaze me to this day right i mean sog missions they called it suicide on the ground because that's what it was and these guys had no identifiable nothing i mean they're they were essentially in pajamas right even their weapons were specially designed by the cia to have no serial numbers no nothing so if they were captured and they became pows pows i don't know who these guys are what what do you think and how much do they think at the highest levels of power about the ethics of assassination and about the role of that in geopolitics and military operations like to you maybe also does assassination make sense as a as a good as a good methodology of war i mean again i try to remain agnostic on the policy part of it and just report the operator's perspective right because this is what people do and this is what people are asked to do and it and it it depends on the individual i mean billy waugh went on a lot of those missions i mean the the saying is like oh billy waugh he killed more people than cancer right did billy waugh ever tell me about direct assassinations no because they're all classified right did he tell me about some failed ones yes i'll give you an example it's really interesting he would he would show me these powerpoints that were just fantastic you know late in his life he was constantly being asked to go up to fort bragg and lecture to the young soldiers and everybody loved him you know and he would he would drive all night to get there and he would create these powerpoints and then he would show me the powerpoints and he would all unclassified but at one point when hugo chavez was in power billy waugh was kind of asked that's how it works of like if you had to think about doing something what would it look like let's just say hypothetically so he took me through this powerpoint that never happened whereby he and a group of operators agency operators were gonna halo jump into the palace and grab chavez and probably kill him because he wouldn't allow himself to be captured and you know what billy and by the way halo jumping for those listeners who don't know high altitude low opening right so you jump out of an aircraft and you go down like a pencil until you're really low to the deck like a thousand feet you pull your parachute cord and that way you're not picked up on radar and you're also not traceable when you get to the ground because it's so fast billy watt took the second halo jump in history into a war theater in laos during the vietnam war right so he's like this famous halo jumper right so he and the team were gonna go in grab chavez and he said to me a very interesting thing that was kind of a one moment in time where i saw a different side of billy waugh where he said i'm so glad we didn't do that even though i really wanted to at the time because can you know can you imagine that country's problems where it is now can you imagine how we would have been blamed and it was a an interesting rare moment for billy waugh to comment on the bigger picture that you're asking me about right yeah i think pretty much the operators i know they just stick to the mission so on the technical difficulty of those missions just your big sense how hard is it to do to assassinate to assassinate a target on the soil of that nation i suppose that just depends right alright here's another insightful bill thing billy wall said to me and i'm answering the question around because i don't know because again you know i never had anyone say to me here's how it went down right because you can't that would be first of all those are classified so i'm never gonna receive classified information i did hear a lot about reconnaissance missions when people would be in charge of you have to be able to what's called make book on the target before right and making book on the target means photographing them to really then that gets run up the chain of command to make sure this is really imad mougneo we're about to kill right but i once asked billy when i was trying to get the question you know and he wouldn't answer it and i said so there's another person in my book named rick prado who's also like a legendary agency guy and and so you know he's like twenty years younger than billy and i said billy if you and rick had to kill each other like who would win right i was trying to imagine this like hypothetical like how would that work who would win right and i i posed the question to each of them yeah right and and of course each of them said me right but billy then i went back to them and they and i billy said let me tell you how i would win okay right and he said i'd cheat mhmm i'd show up before the duel and i'd kill him yeah that's such a such a like you know i have a lot of friends who were navy seals this is a guy conversation well you would be amazed at what the women do let me just tell you that women are part of the special activities division a big part of it can you comment on that i can women can get a hell of a lot closer to a target and i mean that literally the special operations do you mean is this part of the cia the special activities division now it's called the special activity center mhmm but originally that's the that's the umbrella agency that has the different paramilitary organizations under it right so the most lethal one is ground branch and that's what i reported on in surprise kill vanish and its origins go way back to the guerrilla warfare core that was started in nineteen forty seven for the president so women are also a part of the alleged assassination absolutely and you're saying they can at times be more effective i'm just gonna leave that pause there the reason i ask of how difficult the assassinations are you know with bin laden it took a long time mhmm so i guess the reconnaissance the intelligence for finding the target i imagine with mossad maybe they say now the leadership of hamas the military branch of hamas is much wanted mhmm from a assassination perspective so to me as an outside observer it seems like it's more difficult than you would imagine mhmm mhmm but perhaps that's the intelligence aspect of it not the actual assassination of locating the person well i think most it's because mostly from what i understand it's a really it's a really dirty game and people are covering for people right and i'll give i'll give you the example of billy wong imad mughniya if i may right so imad mughniya was was the most wanted terrorist in the world before bin laden you know hezbollah's chief of operations and he was wanted by every you know mossad john down but no one could find him he was missing for twenty years there wasn't even a photograph of him and then he resurfaced and of all places he resurfaced in saudi arabia okay so what that's when i say it's a dirty game right hezbollah iran hezbollah iran enemies with saudi arabia why on earth was was imad mughniya in saudi arabia well that's where he was there was a navy seal who was doing reconnaissance on him this is according to billy waugh and this is around two thousand and five so billy is in his eighties at this point right late seventies eighties and he gets word that the seal who has been tracking mugniya to get photographs of him to give the photographs to mossad and cia so they can do a joint operation to kill him which they did with a car bomb in damascus that's the end of the story right but how we got there was we needed you know the cia needed confirmation you can't kill the wrong person so the seal panicked according to billy waugh and was just like i'm out of here this is too dangerous and i do not wanna wind up in a saudi prison so who do you send in billy waugh right he shows up he's there for twenty four hours he finds he knows where mooknea lives from the seal he positions himself in a cafe across the street which is run by sudanese men and of course wa speaks some sudanese because he operated in sudan right and he's shooting the shit with him by his own words he had the most foul mouth that was just absolutely delightful to listen to and then in between him and mougneha's house is a dumpster mhmm and billy waugh being billy waugh who will go to any lengths to do the job decides to conduct reconnaissance from inside the dumpster mhmm and that is where he is when he takes the picture of imad mughniya living so comfortably in saudi mhmm that he mughniya came according to billy came out of his apartment building with dry cleaner plastic bag hangers over his shoulder that's how comfortable he lived there mhmm it was his neighborhood mhmm click click click billy waugh takes the photographs runs them to the cia headquarters in saudi at the embassy oh my god it's mugna get the hell out of here he gets to the airport he leaves those photographs get sent to the agency and then they do the operation with mossad and mugni is dead now that the truth about that being a co cia mission was not reported for many years after the fact it was originally mossad took credit as the cia often likes to just give other people credit they just want the job done well speaking of mossad what in your understanding of all the intelligence agencies what are the strengths and weaknesses of of the different intelligence agencies out there say hey mossad mi six svr and fsb and the chinese intelligence all this kind of stuff is there some interesting differences insights that you have from all of your studying of cia that's a really interesting question i i don't know and here's why it's because i've never interviewed any intelligence officer with those other agencies right i've interviewed a couple people with shin bet in in israel but until you until i speak to an actual source whose job it was i don't know and so the information that i'm getting is based on perception of others which one would think would be deeply clouded by the idea that america is the greatest right right right right we're better than them you know yes well actually the fascinating thing is because you've spoken to a lot of people about they say hey how do you know they're telling the truth like how do you and this actually probably applies generally to your interviews with very secretive people how do you get past the bullshit like well that's just like multiple sourcing right so so you find the story out and then you have to you go to the national archives and you find the operation and then you learn all about this and then you interview other people who were there and you put the story together to the best of your ability and you make very specific choices with you know quote so and so said end quote said so and so right and very rarely do i report on a single source as i did in the end of area fifty one and then it says essentially look the look dear reader mhmm this is what the source told me i have no way of corroborating it this is legit and here it is so that's an area to make your reader comfortable with the information that they're being given and then in all of my books whether there are three or four hundred pages there's always a hundred pages of notes at the end so you can see all the sourcing and you can begin to get an understanding of how journalism in the national security world works and also great opportunity for me to say i'm often standing on the shoulders of journalists before me who did an incredible job digging into something and being able to report what they knew often the books are ten twenty thirty years old and so much more has come to light since and i also would just like to say that i i appreciate that you said great question i don't know not enough people say i don't know and that's a sign of a great journalist but speaking about things you might not know about let me ask you about something going on currently so recently alexei navalny died in prison perhaps was killed in prison what's your sense from looking at it do you think he died of natural causes in prison do you think it's possible he was assassinated russia ukraine mossad cia whoever has interest in this particular war mhmm for that i look directly to the historical record right having written about russian assassination campaigns and programs since the earliest days of the cold war right and russia has a long history of assassinating murdering dissidents and in surprise kill vanished i tell the story of an actual kgb assassin named kolkoff who knocked on the door of his of the man he was assigned to kill and and by the way this all comes from a book that kolkoff wrote later right because he defected to the united states he knocks on the door and the guy answers the door and instead of killing him he has like this moment of conscious of crisis or crisis of conscience and says like i can't kill you even though that's what i'm supposed to do and then sits down with the guy and together decides okay we're gonna defect you know we're gonna we're gonna let the western intelligence agencies know what we're doing here and the cia got involved but russian assassins were able to poison kolkov with polonium what happens to him is insane and it's a miracle he didn't die but he doesn't and then he defects to the west and he writes these books and he tells lots of incredible secrets about the russian assassination programs and their poison labs and they're really really really interesting and so to answer that question i mean to my eye of course i don't know but it certainly looks like russia is acting in the same vein that it has always acted taking care of dissidents that go against mother russia so in the in the style of kgb assassinations is there something you can comment on about the ways that kgb operates versus the cia when we look at the history of the two organizations the cold war after world war two and leading up to today mhmm i mean my feeling on that is always that there's a thread somewhere in ev in in declassified documentation about these programs of america working to maintain a semblance of democratic ideals however surprising that may be right in other words always trying to i don't wanna say fight fair because you know killing people isn't fair but versus a certain ruthlessness a real sinister totalitarian type ruthlessness certainly from soviet russia i'm far less familiar with modern day russian assassination activities although we certainly know on the record you know that they exist some people have done great reporting on that but there seems to be a kind of almost a sadism about the russian programs that i personally have not seen in the american programs what about on the surveillance side it seems like america is pretty good at surveil mass surveillance or at least has been revealed through nsa and to all this kind of reporting and leaks and whistleblowers can you comment to mhmm the degree to how much surveillance is done by the us government internally and externally if you'd asked me five years ago i would have a very different answer right because alright first of all you can't they're looking for a needle in the haystack they're looking for the bin laden and they can't find the needle in the haystack but they continue to create the haystack and and survey the haystack so is that right yeah okay so but the real problem what has happened and i write about this in my book first platoon which is about a group of young soldiers who goes to afghanistan and unwittingly becomes part of the defense department's bio efforts to capture biometrics on eighty five percent of the population of afghanistan okay which by the way china then emulated in their own biometric surveillance program right and i think this is a a terrible idea but what has happened these biometric systems that have been created and biometrics are of course fingerprints facial images dna and iris scans mhmm that allow you to tag track and locate people okay and what has happened in the five years since this question was first you know on everybody's minds about nsa surveillance is that the civilian sector companies have essentially done all the defense department's biometric surveillance job for them by all of us sharing our facially recognizable images on instagram and facebook and everywhere else x by sharing information by writing up narratives about ourselves this information has become part of the database five years ago when i was reporting first platoon i was interviewing the police chief of el segunda which is kind of like on the outskirts of la it's right near the airport and why it's important is because it's like defense contractor haven okay so they have like you know massive surveillance and chief whelan when i posed this question to him he said to me annie let me show you something and he had clearwater ai the the the recognition software on his phone and this was still when it was like quasi not supposed to have to have that for law enforcement and he said i want you to go down the block and i want you to just turn the corner and come back toward me right which i did and he just didn't even hold up his phone he just kind of it looked like his hand would and his phone was on me and he went back down it was like the tiniest movement mhmm and when i came back to him he went like this and he showed me there i was everything about me everything about me facts and figures and all images and he knew who i was before i even got to him so is that a good thing or a bad thing i mean we could have another three hour conversation about that alone so you're saying more and more you don't need an nsa we're we're giving over the data ourselves yeah publicly or semi publicly yeah during the war on terror people were just like incensed to learn that there is a drone that's flying at something like twenty thousand feet it's called argus is right and it could it can capture the it's not a license plate it's like it can basically capture like what's written on a golf ball from seventeen thousand feet twenty thousand feet up okay and people went crazy over this like oh my god it's big brother well one of the lead engineers on that pat bilkin is someone i talk to regularly because we talk about surveillance a lot because he thinks about it a lot because he has kids now and he is has given so much thoughtful you know really thinks about this issue because he believes just like you stated that what we are turning over about ourselves actually exceeds anything that argus is could do from above because we're doing it willfully and so what it's doing is it's creating an ability for if someone wants to know about you if someone let's say in government wants to know about lex fridman they can find out everything about you and then that gets used for tagging tracking and ultimately you know in the in the war theater it was called find fix finish well what do you think the finish is in that statement it's not pleasant it's called a drone strike yeah find find him with the biometric fix him meaning fix his position we know he's moving in a car that's him that's him finish him call it in drone strike boom if we could return to nuclear war you've briefly mentioned that a lot of things go back to the third right and hitler if we go back to world war two we look at hiroshima and nagasaki the dropping of the two bombs i would love to get your opinion on whether we should or shouldn't have done that and also to get your opinion on what would have happened if hitler and germany built the bomb first do you think it was possible he could have built the bomb first in my researching third reich weapons for operation paperclip because of course we got a lot of those scientists after it's another great book and a terrifyingly complicated operation yes when you know at what point do the ends justify the means right yeah but in looking at those programs and we acquired hitler's favorite weapons designers and i'm talking about weapons of mass destruction like chemical weapons and biological weapons but of course america was ahead in the nuclear program and an interesting detail reading albert speer's memoirs was speer referring to a conversation he had with hitler where hitler said no i don't wanna do that that's jewish science and so because of hitler's own racial ethnic prejudices they didn't develop the bomb right as far as should we have dropped the bombs on hiroshima you know i've interviewed all kinds of people with different opinions most of them that had ended the war the best interview and most meaningful perhaps that i ever did was with al o'donnell who was a participant in the battle of okinawa which was like this insane just to read stories about okinawa it makes your hair stand on end and o'donnell like so many others was slated to invade mainland japan to his almost certain death right so somebody like that it makes sense right from the get go why he would be pro nuclear weapons it saved his own personal life and it saved everyone that he knew that he was fighting with and it ended the war do you think it sent a signal like without that we wouldn't have known perhaps about the power of the weapons so in the long arc of that history seventy years plus it it is it is the reason why deterrence has worked so far yes that's an interesting thought my thought goes to this idea that like of more right that everybody always wants more it's a very dangerous it's like more power literally not just figure more power right and what what is more confounding to me beyond the fact that we dropped two atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki and the war ended is that this decision was then made to develop the thermonuclear bomb a force that is such it's the degree of magnitude of that power is mind boggling i mean even projects within the manhattan project defined thermonuclear weapon the thermonuclear weapon as the evil thing like it was evil it's it's a weapon of genocide atomic weapons destroy cities thermonuclear weapons destroy civilizations you open the book with a churchill quote the story of the human race is war except for brief and precarious interludes there has never been peace in the world and before history began murder's strife was universal and unending do you think there will always be war do you think that there is some deep human way in which we're tending to this kind of global war eternally well the optimistic answer of that would be that we could evolve beyond that right because certainly if we look at our ancestors they had not developed their consciousness as far as we have to be able to build the tools that we have and so the hopeful answer is we will evolve beyond this kind of brute force kill the other guy attitude certainly you know these are questions that will become more obvious over time i just want to play my little part in this world that i live in as the storyteller who brings information to people so that they can have these kind of questions with themselves with their friends with their families and i think in asking that very question you're what you're really saying is why don't we evolve beyond war fighting it is very possible and your book is such a stark and powerful reminder that human civilization as we know it ends in this century it's a it's a good motivator to get our shit together but aren't you really saying human civilization could end not it ends could end could end but the power of our weapons is growing rapidly so as they say it's time to come back from the brink right and it's time to have that discussion while we're still talking and you know there's another complexity sneaking up into the picture in the form of artificial intelligence and in the in cyber war but also in hot war the use of autonomous weapons all of it starts becoming super complicated as we delegate some of these decisions about war including nuclear war to more and more autonomy and artificial intelligence systems it's gonna be a very interesting century do you just to zoom out a little bit hope that we become a multiplanetary species i'm all for adventure and i too while am for adventure i'm all for backups in all forms so i i hope that humans start a civilization on mars and beyond out in space and if you zoom out on across all of it what gives you hope about human civilization about this whole thing we have going on here i mean i am a fundamentally optimistic person i must have come out of the shoot that way because i just am right even though i write about really grim things i i get inspired by them because i do always believe in evolution right i also have like the greatest family ever two kids jett and finley shout out to them they're lex fridman fans -you know -hannah oh yes -hannah and and my husband and you know so what inspires me is like this idea of legacy i think that you always wanna have your eye on being a good example to the best that you can and so and passing on what you know and believing kind of in the next generation and again that's the sentiment echoed by all these cold warriors i've been talking to because they also share that that idea that wow look at what we have done as a civilization and look where we're going whether it's interplan exoplanetary travel or ai it's just that the the human factor of like the desire to fight the desire to have conflict needs to be reconfigured because with all these new technologies that we have the peril is growing at an accelerating pace perhaps faster than the average human can keep up with well annie
