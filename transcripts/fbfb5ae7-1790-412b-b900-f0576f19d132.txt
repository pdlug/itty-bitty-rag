can you introduce everyone yep so we got nikki rod here brown belt two time adcc silver medalist nikki ryan here that's it who are you and i'm kj also a two time adcc silver medalist silver medalist so the number one loser number one loser and maybe a little bit more your bio says widely known as the black belt slayer hails from new jersey the land of pizza and biceps yes that's pretty accurate okay you also do carry gun on you a lot yeah i keep i keep it keep it loaded you know keep it on me uh-huh you have one today in the car that was a mistake that was your first mistake yeah i think you're too close yeah very uncomfortable and you are nikki ryan what else is there what else do we know gordon ryan's brother gordon ryan's brother for that one alright so and you're all together part of the leadership of the the b team here in austin mhmm let's just get out some introductory questions what in general accomplishment of the things you mentioned are you most proud of i mean i'm proud just to not have to work a full time job just to get by on the bullshit i've done so far yeah honestly just making money off a thing you love exactly yeah when was the first time you made money on a thing you love probably a jiu jitsu tournament i think maybe in abu dhabi where i won a thousand dollars thought i was rich yeah yeah what'd you spend a thousand dollars on probably something bad probably drugs or something at the time maybe blew it at the off the potty that's a good introduction to craig so what what about you when's the first time you made money with han jiu jitsu or what what's actually stepping back like what's the thing you're most proud of is it a similar kind of thing i think i think i'm most proud of is i mean for sure two eighty cc silver medals which hurts because you're so close to getting that gold but you know it takes time i'm understanding that you know sport of jiu jitsu takes quite a while to be at the tip top to be the absolute best so and i'm just being consistent in my training and my craft and and i'll get that in the one spot one day what failure or loss is the most painful to you i don't know i could probably have a pretty short term memory so my losses i just like i'll just forget about yeah i mean for sure my loss at at this past adcc in the finals you know that one's something a bit because i definitely thought i i was gonna win i mean like it takes a while to produce the skills or the reactions more so that you need to to have to be you know to be that number one pound for pound guy and you know pre adcc i was coming off of injury so it took me a little bit to find the right mentality and physicality that i needed in order to you know get the wins that required gold so yeah it's just process interesting you keep saying process like it takes a while to build up so you're not like thinking of a loss like a adcc as like specific failures you're not you haven't gone long enough in a particular process to being a champ well i mean for me i'm coming i'm closing in on five years of specifically jiu jitsu training i'm i'm about about four and a half right now and yeah it's just you kinda you constantly have these ups and downs in training where like as long as you stay consistent you'll have a gradual raise but you know it's still you'll have these peaks and lows and you know just just trying to get better every day i'm i'm definitely not where i will be in in a few in a few years from now but my my striving's good there are you actually a brown belt or was that a joke brown belt yeah you're a brown belt like how many stripes no stripes no stripes stripeless okay is that part of the process that that you're working through part definitely part of the process i mean i think a black belt is just based upon how much knowledge you have obviously like you know if you're talking competitive wise like from when i started i was able to beat most black belts that's just kind of how i was gifted from my my wrestling experience and you know the title come when it's right but i'm not in a rush at all i'm i'm continuing i just kind of take every day for what it is and and try to improve upon that i mean i wanna give him the black belt nikki ryan says he's not ready what is are you guys like as no geeks folks do you take that seriously like the black belt or like how much does it come into play into yeah i mean it's like nickirot said you know it's based off of knowledge not just you know what you do out on the competition mats because you know like you said he had years of wrestling experience and obviously he's very physically gifted so we grade based off of the amount of knowledge that you have like how do you measure knowledge i think teaching is a good measurement of it like how well you're able to show the moves and you know really make sure that you have an understanding of what you're doing yeah it's an interesting rank it's like it's something that takes many years to accomplish and for a lot of people it's truly meaningful it's like it represents a particular step in a journey but for you guys it's almost like different because you've been so focused on competition that i guess if you take it seriously it is a big step for you too like as martial artists that that that's bigger than just being like top of the world competitors right so i thought it was a joke you guys are actually taking it seriously like that he's a brown belt that he's a brown belt and he's and you're taking seriously the the rank of black belt and like it's part of it's part of your journey i think by the time i get a black belt i'll i'll be no one pound for pound i think it'd be pretty nice to accomplish that as a brown belt and then maybe toss a black belt on top maybe get promoted on on the podium what do you guys do you love winning or hate losing more i definitely don't hate losing if it pays the bills i don't mind oh really yeah but honestly if i win i feel more relief than anything rather than like excitement and stuff i'm like oh fuck thank god that's over you know i hate i hate losing for sure but i understand that it's necessary to get you know to get to where you wanna be and then winning is like i mean what i think winning is probably the closest you could think you can get to like heroin or something because i mean we're all on a like if you do have extreme success in a a tournament that you've been you know adamant about training for and and competing in for a while and you end up winning it i mean i feel like you're on that high for days at a time afterwards heroin's gonna be better you think so i'm a i'm a stick with no but i'm not gonna suck dick to win you suck dick for heroin okay i guess that's a good point yeah well you know like because you you you come from a little bit of the wrestling culture one of the things i really love is at the end of the match when they lose they just there's no they just run off they're like almost pissed off it's like some mixture of anger and frustration at themselves i think i think sometimes that people like freak out on the mat and i think that's just to to show everybody like they're acting like they cared a lot and really maybe they didn't work enough to to you know get to where they want to where they expect it to be and they lost and then they have this big boost of emotion like after their after their loss but yeah i mean i shouldn't i think you just cry in the mirror and not to everybody else you know what have you ever cried watching a movie i don't think i've ever cried period okay have you cried watching a movie not yet not yet the the notebook i try to avoid those movies i lie actually titanic the last part of a difficult wake up for me is i try to find a sad movie and at least cry about a pound out that really gets me over the line low energy cutting the tears there's other following liquids i could talk to you about but let's just let's just let's just continue on low energy what what about you nikki love of winning versus hate of losing i'm a very competitive person so i for sure hate losing more than i like winning i i do think it's something that's kind of held me back over the the past few years because it makes it so that i'm not as active as i should be because it's like i really hate that feeling of you know after a match that you just lost so it kinda prevents me from competing so it's definitely something i need to work past so like when you think about a competition the possibility of losing which is always there in competition is the thing that like weighs heavy on you in in the months and weeks leading up to yeah my whole life you know my financial stability everything depends on you know my ability to go out there and compete and my ability to teach so you know it's it's a huge hit to the brand if you lose so you know leading up to matches that's that's definitely something that's in my mind i know so you guys are like world class athletes but for me more like a hobbyist competitor i compete a lot the thing i was because i really wanted to win the thing i was probably most afraid of is not just losing but like embarrassing myself yeah even even actually winning by stalling that was the thing i hated the most about myself in terms of crying in the mirror mhmm it's like being too afraid to take risks after i'm up on two points or something i think you gotta in competition sometimes it's good to take the emotion out of it it's too easy sometimes to like think about all my girls in in in the crowd and my family's watching like i wanna win because they're there but the highest level if you're emotional at all you know that's affecting you yeah that's tough though that that's tough especially like leading up to when you're on the map maybe but leading up to it i i think it's okay to be emotional prior like you know if we know adcc or is coming up and we have a big match like definitely i'll go out in in practice and i'll i'll visualize i'll put myself in that competition that way when it's game time it's like i've been there a thousand times already so not the actual competition but even leading up to it like stepping in the mat like all the walk the walk towards it all that all that stuff like i'll do the same exact warm up for weeks on end until my competition day comes that's why that way you know when i compete i'm just like oh it's it's another tuesday at practice what what about you craig like how do you prepare mentally for tournament like adcc i push it completely out of my mind don't even think about it try to avoid any visualization any rituals warm ups anything like that block it out until the last second yeah trying not to think about it i i just gotta train into our fun learn a bit so i try to approach competition the exact same way i don't warm up at training do very little warm up for competition uh-huh and you you just step on the mat step on the mats my philosophy is there's no warm ups on the street we're so vastly different alright so you like legit don't warm up no i probably should now i'm thirty one but i would just like in the gym take it easy the first round you know like if i look around the room and nikki ryan's down i might go alright we'll have an easier first round today jumping so even for like the most high stakes matches you try to push it out yeah i didn't even think about it what about like all the social like instagram posts you have to do about that match you just make a joke out of it and kinda yeah i mean it's actually kinda pretty silly you know we're just wrestling each other you know yeah we put the meaning into it but to someone that doesn't follow the sport it looks stupid well all of human existence is pretty silly like what are we doing none of us really know what's going on we kinda have sex to reproduce we get hungry we eat and then we're all chasing money and cars and whatever the hell in in a capitalist society or we worship a dictator in a authoritarian regime yeah and then we get off on we let power abuse us and then we just murder others because we get off on it yeah and then eventually all of us will die because the sun will run out of energy because colonizing other planets is very difficult so none of it matters it's a good good philosophy it's pretty pretty good that's exactly what how does the sun run out of energy oh you called me there it's it's burnout it's like like a it's a nuclear fusion engine that eventually burns up like when you get tired of training yeah it's never happened i tried to get tired i was like dude it's not working alright cool so you legit don't care about losing it doesn't weigh heavy on you i try not to list like if i win i try to block out all the compliments all the niceties and stuff so i try to do the same with losing it's happened move on to the next one you know don't dwell on it too much and sometimes make a joke out of it yeah exactly win or losing with the right joke we can make money off of the events that transpired that's what's most important excellent thank you i have a bunch of your merch oh nice thank you this one's the jordan burrows rip off all i see is silver the way it pronounce burrows is is very is very very sexy okay i throw lines at people and i try to gauge your reaction like sometimes i'll say something to nikki and i'll be like alright that's probably crossing the line you you know what i mean we'll tone it down to the public so yeah yeah so it's not just right you have to think because it's crossing the line yep yep i get as close to it as possible yeah i feel like you can't really cross it cross it just just a little bit just a little bit yep okay speaking of which you said that i'm switzerland in world war two since i'm friends with both you and gordon and john very rich country are you a hitler or a stalin by the way in this analogy would you like to be hitler or stalin and should you make a t shirt out of it or i mean an nazi t shirt i don't know how well that sells yeah i think it would you know i think let's brainstorm out on this one offline i i think since hitler lost so you got second place in world war two i think that's true that's true think that makes you hitler anyway in to the degree that you can can you tell the story of how the time you've had with the the donna heard death squad and and why you split up i competed against gordon for adcc and ebi in twenty seventeen and i remember i competed against him at adcc and then we had the ebi event and then i had a kasai i was i compete i used to compete all the time every week i wouldn't even do the prior preparation or anything i'd just be like trying to do seminars make money and then jump in and compete i remember i showed up to kasai after i faced him twice and there were like four locker rooms and they put me with all the dds guys it was just me and all of dds and i think we competed the week weekend before mhmm so i thought it was gonna be super awkward but it was actually it was actually pretty chill and the kasai was in new york and they suggested to come train that week mhmm so i came trained hung out with them a bit ultimately the goal was to move to america and join a bigger team just because that flight to australia is death australia is so far away from everywhere it's kind of like not realistic to base yourself in australia when all the tournaments are in america and then i went and trained with the guys and they just had a massive massively deep talent pool in that room like show up to like a meant to be seven am actual eight am class on brazilian time it'd be like a hundred people in there maybe i don't know how many black belts but a ton of elite guys and i was coming from australia training with lachlan giles but really that room was pretty shallow and like most people had serious jobs and stuff so it was like basically me just training with lachlan maybe a couple of other guys and then to go to new york and have access to a a wide array of training partners and guys that are training twice each day i feel like that's what you really need you need people that can train as much as you are working humbled you're humbled in that room at first for sure because my style at the time was basically a rip off version of what they were doing yeah leg logs came in i remember just watching eddie cummings nonstop and just seeing this guy rip people's legs off and i was like you know what that's probably a good move you know that looks like an easier path to victory than trying to beat these guys at what they what they're good at already you know my philosophy at the time was if it's bothering old brazilians yeah it's bothering them for a reason yeah it's probably effective and that's the path i took to sort of try to rip off their moves and then obviously to go into that room try to do them to them it's gonna be a bit more difficult alright so that's how it started how did you end up here how do we end up here we're in austin texas i mean i like to think of puerto rico as apocalypse now mhmm john danaher as colonel kurtz things got very weird in the jungle and the teams went into different directions but honestly i mean it's not really my story to tell i had some issues with some of those people at the time of the split i got along very well with john i feel like me and him connected very well i don't know why that was maybe it was just because of the he missed home he missed a familiar accent australian new zealand accent but i mean i basically followed nicky yeah left with nicky sort of that core group of guys left with nikki and i mean i just back there was personal problems and i just back nikki basically got it just sticking on you for a bit is there a part of you that you know finds it heartbreaking that dds split up does part of you miss working with john and everybody now can you steal me on the case for that i mean i miss certain aspects of it but i also do prefer the freedom of being apart from it it's obviously a very strict regime under john danaher you know obviously there's parts of it i miss the parts the the public doesn't see of john the behind the scenes banter i feel like he's very conscious of the image he portrays to the world but basically a closed doors he's always making jokes always finding i guess more in line with the australian kiwi sort of culture mhmm but you don't really see that in the public eye so that perspective i do miss that relationship with john in terms of setting aside personal differences gordon was a good training partner definitely a good training partner to train with but obviously the negative things we can't really talk about outweighed all of those things and we obviously had to make a decision to leave but yeah does that happen in the jungle the things that happen in the jungle shall never be spoken of that i personally cannot speak of yeah but obviously i do miss certain aspects like i mean not nothing's all bad nothing's all good you know yeah this goes back to your like everything we're doing is silly yeah exactly that's why i don't get people take it so serious martial arts so serious it's just it's just pretty stupid really especially in the ghee it looks just it looks bad and then i'm i mean it's pretty silly with with and without the ghee sam's just a bunch of apes what's silly about no ghee and what's silly about the ghee and just mix and match bottoms there you know what i mean wait which one standby yeah i see what you're doing brother you come to my house to defend my people alright this is we're gonna go to every dark place apparently nick how did you get with dds like what was that journey like is there try to see if there's things that you remember fondly that that you've gotten from the experience alright so the way i started training with dds initially i was training for like well initially i was i was a bouncer right i i dropped out of college to pursue this fitness modeling career i ended up signing with the wilhelmina models up in new york and i was like try to try to get in better shape and while i was bouncing kind of the talk of like you know who's tougher came up between the wrestlers and a few of the bouncers that train jiu jitsu and you know they convinced me to go to a practice and and i went to my first practice over there and for the most part i just controlled everybody got on top of them was able to avoid like kind of like you know shitty submissions because i i had i had an awareness of of the sport and and you know i'm i'm a fan of fighting and whatnot so you know i kind of understood it pretty well and then soon after that i joined a school and my second week of jiu jitsu i started competing had pretty good success you know i i was like subbing a few black belts and beating everybody like you know pretty decisively with points and stuff and about three months into training locally i got connected with gordon gordon ryan and john danaher up in new york and i started i committed to you know make the drive up there as many days as i could at the at the time i lived in south jersey and it was about a two and a half hour three hour drive without traffic to your to where where in south jersey gloucester county clayton new jersey specifically but gloucester county yeah so it's about it's about about a hundred and thirty miles and without traffic you know about and two two and a half hours or so but on the way back man we it'd be three plus sometimes you know you're catching that rush hour what year was this do you remember this was in twenty thirteen for a bit i forget how young you are yeah i was there before before all that alright cool anyway you're doing the long drive and then and then and then what yeah doing the long drive and then you know once i won adcc trials i was able to make a couple bucks and then you know i got my silver medal at adcc and i was able to afford to live up there in new york in in north jersey area so i lived up there trained there full time every day and you know just kinda stuck with the team throughout throughout the turbulent times and found ourselves in austin in the jungle in the jungle yeah the things we we shall not speak of what what's other things that you remember that you've learned from john donahuehrer from your time you spent with him yeah i mean i definitely learned a ton from from john and the team as a whole like you know it's you have to be the guy that asks questions in in the type type of environment right because there's not it's not you're not gonna get singled out to be that specific like star or the the the best guy in the room when you have all these other you know stud athletes so i really had to seek out and and figure out the kind of questions that i needed to ask and once i became a bit more verbal with my training and you know i i'm showing i'm i'm i'm expressing all my curiosities about grappling to these guys definitely helped boost my boost my technique and my career as a whole yeah did you understand what kind of stuff like technically you wanna get good at what fits your body what like what would be good for you what what are your weaknesses and all that so initially when i started grappling i had an innate ability to just get to opponent's back so i was like alright i'm i'm good at getting to back let me get let me perfect controlling the back and then submitting opponent via rear naked choke and then besides that i really focused on leglock defense and then eventually came the body lock pass where you know i'm i'm really good at body lock passing my opponents now and and yeah it just takes a quite a long time because you have to find different sequences and then there's always these an abundance of opportunities that your opponent gets from these specific sequences so it takes a while is there part of you that finds the fact that dgs split up heartbreaking i definitely you know having one person to go to that runs practice every day that's you know consistent it it was definitely it was definitely definitely a gift but now i'm also gifted with many many other partners i have nikki ryan you know craig jones steve steve claus yeah yeah we have ethan kralisi damian anderson so a full team of knowledgeable athletes that i can continue to go to with multiple questions but yeah definitely definitely it took me some time to adjust to to training or to learning from you know specifically my team and not just one person we should mention for people just listening because you can't visually see that nicky ryan is currently terrified and craig jones is currently enjoying the fact that nicky ryan is terrified but anyway can you talk about your nikki can you talk about your time with dds i started training when i was like around thirteen you know my brother gordon had started prior to me and i really just went into training just as like a means to exercise and lose weight at the beginning because i was pretty fat as a kid so i went to the first class loved it and then just started training every day at at gary's gym brunswick and then during the summer when i would get off from school they would take me up to new york to to train under john and you know i just absolutely loved it i knew what i wanted to do with my life at a young age so i ended up dropping out of school actually after my my freshman year in high school so yeah fifteen i ended up dropping out and just pursuing jiu jitsu full time you know training every day up in the the blue basement like what aspects of jiu jitsu was made you know that this is the thing for you it's just something i just enjoyed being you know like on the mats every day i love that there's you know a problem solving aspect to it so it's you know it's mentally challenging it's physically challenging helps me get in shape so i just yeah right off the bat i i knew i loved it okay so then we'll go to the jungle what happened in the jungle yeah and in general like i like this i like this this this is like this like shroud of mystery that she'll never be penetrated that she'll never be like we've got a book deal it's coming wasn't it book deal yeah alright obviously he left moscow he's not writing it right now okay i'll do the russian translation okay so what are what are things that you enjoy that you remember from working with john donner yeah i mean you know obviously he's considered one of the best coaches in the world you know very charismatic guy when you see him in person you know i i pretty much was you know kinda raised in the dds you know that's where i spent the the majority of my time every day so i obviously had very deep connections you know with john my brother gary you know even eddie cummings and stuff back then so obviously i miss interacting with those guys every day and you know it's like they said it's it's good to have somebody to kinda crack the whip at you every day and john john was very good at that when you're like younger in your teenage years you can kinda you like have to get humbled right there's like a process to that yeah for sure and that's a pretty good room to get humbled in i guess yeah exactly i mean i i was i started training with them just when like everybody started to break out gary was like the biggest name at the time just because he had won adcc trials already and he had a crazy match with kron at kron gracie at at adcc but eddie was just starting to break out gordon just started winning ebi so i i started training under john you know right when when everything was exploding what are the good things about life about jiu jitsu you learned from your brother both me and my brother never really wanted to you know work a full time job doing something that we hate and he was always you know a very confident person so he just went you know full fully started pursuing jiu jitsu so i'm very happy that you know he did that and i ended up following in his footsteps because you can ask these guys i'm a lazy sack of shit out of out outside of the the the mat so that's that's definitely one thing that i'm very grateful for that he paved the way like you can you can make money doing stuff you love yeah exactly and he was he was a big reason you know why my parents eventually let me drop out of school because you know when when they were coming out there was there's no money in the sport it was very hard to make a full living like if you wanted to actually make a living you'd eventually have to transfer to mma and i feel like gordon and and gary and those guys were you know some of the first people to make a very good living off of just jiu jitsu at this party you find it heartbreaking that you split up from dds but also from your brother in terms of spending time in the mat every day yeah for sure you know i mean growing up you know obviously he's he's my big brother i i looked up to him a lot so i definitely like i said i'm misinteracting with those guys i was pretty much raised you know in that blue basement you know that john was like you know a father figure to me so i definitely you know miss miss seeing those guys every day do you have animosity towards gordon and does he have animosity toward you and what is the source of that and do you think you'll ever be able to forgive each other definitely initially during the the initial split we we definitely hated each other at the beginning but it's definitely started to to calm down actually just prior to you know all this social media drama that's going on currently he reached he had reached out to me and that was literally like the first time that we have actually talked since since the split happened so we didn't talk to each other for was it now like almost two years and that was the first time that you know we we interacted again and overall you know he wasn't you know aggressive towards me i wasn't aggressive towards him you were cracking some jokes so hopefully the the animosity is going down there's this godfather quote that i wrote down i recently rewatched it from from the don from don corleone vito corleone the strength of a family like the strength of an army lies in its loyalty to each other is there some aspect of family that you miss of the blood that kinda connects you that you can count on yeah my parents you know they they both raised us that you know like family is everything you never you know betray your family or anything like that so i definitely you know miss them from time to time okay imagine you're like forty years from now sitting on a porch with a shotgun drinking whiskey looking over like all the land you've conquered looking back to this moment is the reason you split up a bullshit reason or is it a good reason from the perspective of the king who has now conquered the lands have proven himself have done everything i think it was definitely like a justifiable reason for the team splitting like it just with the way things were going it just was not gonna work with you know all of us in the same room together it was started you know affecting training people didn't feel comfortable in things so i definitely think that it was a a justifiable reason to split the things that happened in the jungle yeah to be told about in the book is it gonna be an audiobook or is it just gonna be and who's gonna voice it might be a play a musical yeah musical on broadway how's your singing voice mine's not so good but nicky has a beautiful voice does he of an angel like a headbutt okay speaking of the the social media drama i should mention that i've talked to recently to gordon a bunch i've talked to him about talking to you guys and he's had nothing but really nice things to say about you nick and he has had nothing but bad things what what were some of the things there it was well let's let's just go to the social media first because the the social media stuff that he said publicly is just like a warm up it's like foreplay i guess so gordon sent you nicky rod flowers for valentine's day posting on instagram quote i've been fucking him in every round and competition since we met in twenty eighteen the least i can do is buy him flowers we didn't get the flowers no it's yeah that was that was the question did you get some flowers you never got flowers he sent it to the wrong address he did yeah where where do you think he sent it it was close but it was wrong did you appreciate the romantic gesture i did i was looking forward to the flowers and potentially chocolates in there but you know it was a bit of a letdown can you describe your recent match against gordon the ebi match okay so ebi match on ufc fight bouts was a twenty minute match and immediately no match starts i pull guard and then i stand up he pulls guard and we have this kind of like back and forth where he's trying to dig for underhooks trying to get on top of me and he can't really find success and now and and then in the midst of me trying to work my body lock pass gordon's able to underhook a leg and we end up in a leg entanglement and then i'm able i'm able to transfer that leg entanglement to a fifty fifty position still leg still in the leg entanglement from that fifty fifty position i'm able to separate his feet and and actually get a few pops in and he actually said i broke his foot in that exchange with the toe hold with the toe hold yep and you know after after that we had a a bit more i was i was just being working on top position trying to get my body locked time runs out and we go to overtime and overtime can you hold on a second let me check what does it mean to break a leg what's i was very confused about okay so is this like expression or what do you mean what what do you mean what what do you broke what which part breaks in a toehold okay so on a toe hold there's a few different grades of it like you could get a a few pops and have some have some you know walking issues and people consider that a break and then you could break it fully and have your foot be like a a limp noodle you know i think what will those achilles well it's the front of the achilles or something i mean probably the ligaments i mean it's funny like a lot of people say they broke something but like to me you break bones you tear ligaments so i would imagine you probably had a grade three tear grade three how hard do you think is it to i always wondered that with with like a straight foot lock how hard is it to break the shin or like the actual bones versus to tear stuff depends how many steroids they're on and obviously how much you're on you're one of the few guys that have actually broken bones in competition yeah have i oh yeah vin couple yeah which bone did you break spiral fracture of the fibula very similar power right there does it get twisting how did you break it oh it was a heel hook vinny always used to say heel hooks don't work leg locks don't work but unfortunately age gets the best of all of us i think he had some mileage on those ligaments yeah and the bone i guess yeah so it's actually what the the bone yeah his ankle like disconnected from the tibia and the fibula but the fibula definitely snaps pretty bad there that's fascinating the dynamics of that okay anyway you went into overtime what happened in overtime okay what happened in overtime let's see trying to hang oh okay i go defense first whistle blows i'm able to escape in like seventeen seconds and then immediately after i go on his back and he gets out in exactly seventeen seconds i'm like shit alright i thought i had a good start and then he gets on my back right after that and he's able to ride me out for pretty much the entire round after that he i go back on his back he escapes in maybe like a minute and some change i think where i went wrong in the overtime is i should've went i should've been less adamant about chasing the submission and more aware of collecting time if i kind of diverted my attention towards acquiring you know time on the clock it would've been you know more in my favor but yeah at the end of my overtime round i would i'm able to lock up a ring naked choke over the face but there just wasn't enough time to fully finish you know i got a few seconds of squeeze in there i didn't have enough time to adjust and got it do you think if you're on stairs you would've finished the choke i i mean for sure for sure that's what i thought it's like if you're on gear it you're you're changing the biology of your body right you're you're adjusting your dna for sure if i adjust in my dna i mean yeah this is finished so you're implying you're a natural athlete is what you say oh i'm definitely a natural athlete yeah heavy emaciation okay so for people who don't know the the ebi rules it's an interesting rule structure where the over time you put yourself in a in like the worst possible position and the task is to escape and then the other person gets the same thing what do you guys think about that rule set i i like it just because i first of all i don't i don't like the idea of having to put somebody on my back but i do like the definitive answer in the match like either you escaped in time or you got you know ridden out so the absolutely like you have a you get to the final winner that's great i'd much rather have that than a close decision and kinda goes other way what about you chris i mean honestly there's all the different rules when i look at the rule sets i just try to think of what rule set i could beat that individual in and i sort of gear myself towards that that's really the strategy there i think there's some guys that like that stall a lot that you would love to have ebi overtime with at the end you know they're stalling until they have to give us a good position but then there's some guys that are so good in those positions i'm like oh maybe we just do a regular match you know what are the rules in the streets the streets no time limit yeah that's one of it there's also like concrete and cars and stuff biting biting yeah bulking yeah so you don't like that rule set are there some people you would prefer in the street as a rule set me probably not i don't know the ebi i mean it's tricky you know it depends on the opponent which rule set i'd wanna do what about you nikkor what do you think about the rule set of ebi yeah so i think ebi is is very good from a spectator point of view you know people find it very entertaining to watch you know because your people wanna see submissions and you're putting people yeah you're putting the athletes in a in a position where you know you have like the highest percentage submission in the sport so obviously you're gonna get a lot of submissions my issue with it is it is a rule set that allows somebody that's overall worse at jiu jitsu to win a match you know know a guy can go out there and just stall and just get completely dominated for the entirety of regulation and then he gets to start on the guy's back so that's that's one my my one issue with it but also i mean it's in interesting to see like the best people in the world have to be put in a really bad position and to see how good their escapes are for example yeah i see it's interesting yeah but but it doesn't feel like realistic it's it's a fun thing to watch but it doesn't feel like the real fight yeah it feels weird i'll claim it if i start an overtime on someone to finish them i'll claim it but if they submit me an overtime on last you're good to know yeah not a real submission it's good the issue is people like stalling to just win overtime so where you got this guy his his whole training camp is just not get subbed and and win overtime it's a bit boring by the way i have a a rose behind you somebody gave me a valentine's flower so if you if you missed the one from gordon i got one for you well i'd appreciate that thank you it's good to feel loved yeah alright so what did you learn from that match like a takeaways technically speaking like what what what do you need to work on well i learned that i am pretty good yeah pretty good i got a you know a few i know exactly what my weakness is you know it's the the leg lock department and i'm doing i'm doing a lot to to you know get better in that specific aspect defense or attack i i would say yeah attack defense reattacks even if i wanted to offensively enter a leg you know i could use some work there as well but i feel like once i solidify like my like if i come in i'll become a black belt specifically in the leg lock department i feel like i'd be unstoppable if you nick you definitively beat gordon ryan how would you do it buggy choke buggy choke buggy choke for the listener i don't even know how to describe buggy choke what's what's the definitive like conclusion on on on that choke does it work it's a it's a choke that you do when you're in a what's the opposite of a dominant it's not submissive in a nondominant position of bottom of side control yeah just an embarrassing submission to get caught with really yeah but does it work it works on certain people for the listener he glanced over a nikki mask it's embarrassing but it's also what it's a way to frustrate the the opponent for sure yeah it's a new pilot's boy i feel like the ritollos brought it back into fashion and even if you don't get it because it's one of those moves that's so embarrassing at the first sign of danger the top guy abandoned ship and you can basically retain guard by attempting a very embarrassing submission so the threat of embarrassment yeah to everybody people pull out very quick to avoid suffering the consequences i think some people underestimate how good of a submission is i mean like once you're locked in there there's not too many defenses for a buggy choke are you is there an instruction on the way from you on the jay rod actually my little brother has one oh yeah for real you actually legit have oh wow you have that's awesome i'll check it out so i mean there is i mean you're making a joke out of it but it is real like there's a system to it i mean yeah i don't know we call it a system it's a good move i mean you take an opponent that was just winning in a in a in a greatly dominant position and then boom in that same position they're pretty much they're losing you know it's it's an interesting move what's the name of the what's the name of it it's called the buggypedia by jay rodriguez okay the the buggypedia i thought there'd be something like very craig jones y about it okay awesome i know you don't wanna sort of reveal the secrets of what you're working on but in general do you what like some what does it take to beat gordon i guess is the question it would have to be some kind of a choke i think any joint lock or anything like that he's just gonna let it break and and stay in the match so i i don't even think he'd tap from like a a ring naked choke i think i would have to put him to sleep so putting him to sleep is a solid one so gordon is somebody who really hates losing yeah like he won't even tap in the in the practice room i remember like i had a toe hold a couple times in practice room and he was just comfortable like working there i'm like i'm not really putting much on it i think he just you know maybe because of situations like that in practice he kinda didn't respect my toeholds ability in in competition you've done that to me in the practice i yes i have yeah yeah i'll give you a little you know give me a little pop and then he let go and i was just that was only ten percent right there hey don't get into math okay is there some part of that you think is necessary to be a champion as to like this almost unwillingness and competition to tap i think there's definitely something to be said for people that are just like you know willing to go the extra mile or to take that damage to secure their their victory is there a part of you that like would hate to tap or hates to tap yeah i mean all all of me they would hate that yeah you all the whole part of me isn't there a john legend song like that all all of you and all of me very romantic yeah yeah no we're sticking on that theme okay i'm sorry oh one of the things gordon uh-oh asked i i forget how you put it because i think there's a lot of words that would need to be censored involved but he said ask them how it feels to have a zero five record against me with four submissions combined i mean first of all i wasn't sure he could count to five yeah that's impressive to me that's impressive o and five i mean i will say one thing nobody beats me four times i love you so much lex i did have a question i did have a question for you there was some controversy on your twitter yeah about a list of books yeah and i was wondering why gordon's book wasn't featured amongst that literature well it was only the first thirty books or like the first twenty books and it would of course be in something interesting about gordon he's the first author that's written more books than he's read pretty good if you if you face him and beat him what like what what's your take on what it takes to beat gordon i you guys kinda joke and they go pretty pretty hard recently on each other but as a fan of jiu jitsu i'm all in on this rivalry it's just fun to watch i mean first of all i don't think i go really hard with him i think gordon is he's pretty sensitive you know what i mean he's looking for a large insult and a small insult and for me like australians we just attack each other mhmm all day every day and for me like if i see someone that takes himself very seriously that's like blood in the water that's funny to me to me if i can just gently provoke and get a strong reaction that's hilarious like aussies we will just attack each other and the first person that gets upset he kinda loses the exchange so i think that is very very entertaining like if you were to beat gordon would the mental game off the map be part of it i think it would be a fact of a show but i mean i'm never gonna come out too crazy direct with him you know like i don't i i find that like if you get too upset on the line and you're going crazy i find that i'd be embarrassed to do that myself obviously each everyone's different everyone has a different style you know but like yeah i think mental the mental aspect would play a big factor i mean mainly because if i were to beat him mhmm i would send him a message every day until i died yeah just to gently remind him that i got the last one the last one is all that matters we're not giving accurate yeah we're not giving story so like once once you beat him you you're going to run for the rest of your life i mean run but look back yeah you know look back up with messages side set ride ride your horse to into the sunset okay by the way you've talked very lightly you've talked shit very lightly against alexander volkanovski's opponent very lightly have you received death threats or how's how are you still alive like gordon mhmm i would say people from dagestan of take a drug very well you know what i mean really do they really no oh like oh like sorry i'm slow now aggressive mode in my head now honestly listening to you islam was pretty cool i wanted to stir it up a bit you know because like i felt like that was a massive fight and it probably should have had more attention than it was receiving so i wanted to just gently stir it up a bit i feel like sambo guys are in the same vein as catch wrestlers very sensitive you know like obviously there's only three people in the world that do catch wrestling sambo maybe ten to fifteen so i figured we could really provoke them with that sort of jiu jitsu sambo stuff islam took the joke very well the russian fans not so much very serious there's not many smiles in russia you know they didn't take it as well i'm trying to suppress the anger the rage is building side slowly so you guys mentioned steroids i like that you bring that up after we talk about russia for the record smooth smooth segue there i i cannot condone the statements said by the aussie but i i would love to travel with you to russia that would be a good time yeah you might get killed with me now no i would be the like the first to to to turn to backstab you like i got in there i got in alright are most of the top grapplers on steroids i mean it's hard to say you know some people look like shit and they're on steroids some people look excellent and they're not on steroids it's so so hard to tell but that seems to be the the general consensus that a lot of people are on steroids i'm always a little bit i don't know so i'll be honest i've never i've never seen anyone take steroids i've never taken steroids i don't even know if that's the right term to use or like trt any of that so i'm very careful like to not let my naivete like lead me to take conclusions but i do feel a little bit weird about the witch hunt nature of it that some people a little bit too eagerly claim that others are on steroids just because they're successful but at the same time it does seem that a lot of athletes will do whatever it takes to be successful yeah i mean if a sport doesn't test you gotta assume most people are gonna do it and especially now as more money comes into the sport you gotta assume more people are gonna do it you know i generally like do agcc and like does jiu jitsu test it's actually encouraged what's encouraged okay you get a pamphlet okay they don't test there's no testing they test to make sure we're on steroids because obviously it's a big show for the ufc five plus in the future you don't want anyone coming in out of shape very nice do you think using steroids in that kind of context in sports is wrong like stepping stepping away if it's not illegal i mean i like to assume everyone's on steroids and i have to feel bad about using steroids myself yeah do you use them you use all of the steroids i'm over thirty it's drd you know that's the medical definition that's that's the medical okay i'd like to meet your doctor therapeutic use you know therapeutic right like how do you just feel about it i mean it is cheating for sure whether they test for it or not i think it is cheating obviously some people are gonna say oh fuck everyone's on it i should be able to get away with it makes it even playing field you know know but it kinda becomes russian roulette because it's like if one guy's taking a small amount and the other guy is taking a huge amount yeah he's gonna reap huge rewards in the short term probably be dead pretty early but die a champion mind you you know what i mean so it's like i don't know where that one is yet yeah what do you think about that do you think do you think it's worthy to take health risks i think if you're for the glory i think if you're forty about to die looking at a cabinet of gold medals for wrestling other men it's probably not gonna hit the same way on your deathbed you know what sorry in which direction like is that a good thing or not no you're probably gonna feel like oh fuck i probably wasted a bit of health on that you know you think so isn't that isn't that like the glory of it like you said other men yeah yeah yeah well i mean it might have been you know maybe rest of a woman as well but what'd you do with with gabby on valentine's day where did you take her did you guys we filmed some new stuff for onlyfans for onlyfans we never stopped working stuff so it's the love affair is also a work affair okay i don't know i i i there's something to that i mean like like olympic gold medalist accomplishing like the heights like sacrificing everything just everything the first twenty thirty years of your life for this silly little piece of metal i don't i think there's something beautiful to that that's like inspires a a lot a lot of people and that's like the height of the human condition in a way like how survive i'm just saying if you're in your deathbed early in life from die all men die jones but not all men truly live how many years how many years are you willing to shave off for a gold medal that's a good question how many how how many are you willing to shave off for a gold medal what year for a silver medal for silver i mean for a silver medal i'd shave a few off i think two silvers makes a gold it's worth five years five to ten maybe shave off the bad years enhance the good ones you know well i mean you've sacrificed you guys sacrificed a lot a lot of your life you continue to sacrifice oh you don't you don't see it as sacrifice it's fun i think training's fun being bit adamant about it consistent gives you you know we i think we have a great routine great ritual definitely enjoy the process alright well do you guys know this is bro science or or i'm talking bro scientist but do you know how long steroids stay in your system forever forever i'll be hey once you do it you own it yeah just the knowledge yeah alright i think it's i think it's different for each steroid right i think some of them last longer than others it depends if it's a urine you would think i would do a little research before this asking these questions why do you think most athletes and coaches don't talk about steroids like why is it such a like a secret why is it so embarrassing i think they probably talk about it like amongst the team and whatnot again i mean it's only it's it's gonna be more shady if it's like a your your sport is tested or whatnot we're kind of in the wild west in the in the grappling world you know yeah but why why don't grapplers talk about it because it seems cheating i mean it's it's kind of insinuated as a a bit of cheating even if it's not like if it's not tested i mean still you're you're taking a person that could you know maybe has good jujitsu good mechanics you're putting them on the leg and they're something with a heel hook versus breaking your leg with a heel hook you know something as subtle as that can make you know big differences alright this is gonna make me sound dumb but is it possible that steroids are not a huge help in in grappling i think if you're bad at jiu jitsu and you do steroids you can gonna continue to be bad at jiu jitsu but if you're great at gear i'm sorry if you're great at at grappling if you're great at grappling and then you also do gear it's gonna enhance what you're already you know good at and make you much better but like how much is the enhancement i guess is the question how much is is muscle valued like if you're that's the question if you're doing gear and you're not changing weight that much like maybe it it helps you a little bit but if you know you're you're gaining fifty sixty pounds of pure muscle and it's like that's a huge enhancement that's another human does this this muscle a small human yeah does does muscle matter in jiu jitsu i guess this is the question yeah is it possible that it gets in the way i say muscle matters but technique matters more i also think that it it'll help you develop technique as well because obviously you know testosterone helps with recovery rate so if you're on gear you're able to train a lot more now with that being said if you're not able to learn obviously it's not gonna help in that aspect but if you're somebody that knows how to learn and get good at jujitsu and then you add gear on top of that you're able to do significantly more sessions throughout the week k and by the way gears steroids steroids yeah okay i also think that you don't have to be as consistent in like your sleep in your food and stuff if you're if you're on gear you have a little bit of leeway but i mean being consistent in in your diet and and your sleep definitely would would would help you know the process since you use most steroids steroids yep yeah of any athlete i've ever met do you think steroids help help jiu jitsu oh man i think obviously it helps recovery and your ability to train more but i think some i've seen some guys go on steroids and then suddenly they feel like the incredible hulk and now in the training room they just start to rely more on strength yeah than the techniques they had and it actually in some respect hinders them and makes them gas more in competition because then they're using more of the muscle they never used to have so you've implied that you're a natural athlete mhmm you said that you said that skeptic skeptical lex is is it is this something you do for like for social media to talk shit to gordon to imply that he's not a natural athlete well i only pretty much recently on social media i had this rebuttal you know saying that you know gordon's on gear and i only said that because after after our match in in the our most recent match you know the ebi rules match he accused me of greasing which is like lubing up so i'm slippery during our match so and you and you did not i did not i was checked multiple times before and after our grappling event and he still you know went out and accused me of this so i was like alright as opposed to telling a lie i'll just tell the truth about you know your your steroid use which shouldn't be that big of a deal in retrospect because he kind of admitted it and whatnot you know previously so it's yeah i just kind of felt like i had to rebuttal and i i didn't do it immediately because i was like alright i'll i know i have this podcast planned so i'll wait to do it on you know my friend mark bell's podcast you know it'd be a little more more get a little bit more exposure on it sure and yeah i knew he was gonna bite the bait but i didn't think he was gonna you know bite the bait that hard i i know he's a little stressed out about about the comment but you know and that was the origin of you guys going back and forth on well it wasn't so much back and forth it was just i went forth and then he kept going back back back like i i remember one of one of my guys dm'd me and they were like gordon's made like sixty eight instagram stories and sixty seven of them were all about you i was like alright well i'm in his head for sure got us a few followers we appreciate that we did sean yeah did get followers he even shouted out our our b team white belt program so thank you yeah okay speaking of which what's the b team how does it run and why is it called the b team well i mean craig was the a team taken i would've been for me b is for best okay best alright what does b stand for for you what does it represent what is the ideal like the you know miyamoto musashi philosophical foundation of b team aim low and achieve if the bar is set low you can't help but win okay that's nikki's philosophy with women as well set the bar incredibly low overachieve so what what what is the b team how do you guys run it like what's yeah i mean can you just talk about the school how you found it what what what what is it what's it like i mean pretty much just a regular jiu jitsu gym we started as sort of a pros only purple belt and above team and we have me nikki rod nikki ryan ethan damien as coaches am i missing someone oh jb your memory is with your old age impeccable memory yeah and we got jb coming on to teach white belts but just your stock standard jiu jitsu team we focus on more we lean heavily towards the professional athlete side of things we have a lot of high level guys in there yeah class structure regular instruction and positional sparring open rounds but we sort of took a a heavy slant on marketing side of things we really try to blow up the youtube channel obviously we sell a lot of clothing merchandise and stuff so yeah we just sort of took a modern approach to a standard jiu jitsu gym because i mean jiu jitsu gyms are full of some of the most boring human beings on earth so we try to highlight strong words greg jones strong words highlight the other side of things you know keep it pretty light hearted that it can be fun yeah that jujitsu can be fun i guess that it could be cool too you know it's not just full of stare at it up autistic people you know question from reddit quote need to hear some of the stories about drop ins that led to the making of the gem of a video the do's and don'ts of training a b team any any fun stories any ones that stand out do you guys remember any police involved ever we had a guy come in we had to kick him out he was stalking two of the members yeah well i mean there's just crazy people you know like i portray a pretty insane image online and i guess i am that a lot of the time but at training try to keep it while training around training i'm insulting everyone but while training i try to keep it pretty serious but obviously the image i portray lou is in some of the the crazier members i mean like the thing is about the the gym you guys run is is really professional it's like friendly it's like the lighthearted joking is there obviously this the you know like shit talk and all that kind of stuff but like it's it's a pretty safe environment yeah but but the public persona might attract some some maniacs yeah i won't say which place to start training but there's obviously some places you walk into the room and it's very very serious yeah there's no smiles around obviously it's probably average training room in russia but no smiles very serious environment you know what i mean and i definitely don't like that i don't wanna show up to training and be walking on eggshells not know what the coach's mood's like that day i wanna go and have a good time keep it lighthearted what was in the video what what are the do's and don'ts because like the address is public like anyone can show up anyone can show up yeah what would the do's and don'ts be does anyone challenge you like to a fight not yet not yet i mean probably from other gyms in town they probably that's probably coming down the line but do's and don'ts i'm i'm all in on that i'm i'm i'm i would be excited as a fan to just watch i love the drama not the drama no no no well a little drama a little drop of poison is good but ultimately it's the the best grapplers in the world kinda going at it yeah that's fun because i may maybe i'm wrong but i think there is an underlying deep camaraderie at the end of the day when you're like at the top of the world yeah and you're like in the same town what could possibly go wrong it's like a shitty western but like an epic western we're like clint east with like the good the bad and ugly of course i love it i'm i'm here just eating popcorn like that staring the pot i'm not staring the pot i'm not staring the pot these questions are from reddit they're not what i'm eating but that that one for sure yeah i mean what could possibly go wrong if you're the world's best grappler hates you and you're gently provoking him behind the scenes every day well i mean for sure in texas and you've stolen his brother held it for ransom kidnap it's it is like a story of a shitty western i think you now allow white belts to train with you what's it like to open it up to a bigger audience we haven't opened it up yet but it'll be interesting to see i mean i i feel like your higher belts they really understand what the training room is you know what i mean white belts early they're trying to find their place in the gym it could be kinda awkward and stuff in that environment so i think obviously those white belts coming in will change the dynamic but the white belts will have a separate white belt classes obviously for them because given it's such a high level gym it'd be tough for a beginner to be able to enter the more advanced classes well obviously we're teaching more advanced techniques so yeah we've separated a white belt program i believe six pm on friday yeah maybe we'll have a saturday one as well but it'll be interesting to see how it goes we're trying to do things different you know like trying to do your traditional jiu jitsu gym's obviously not gonna teach beginners wrestling at all we're trying to split it at least thirty three percent top game bottom game and wrestling so at least create more well rounded athletes from day one whereas i feel like most traditional jujitsu gyms might have no gi once a week they don't touch wrestling very heavy techniques but again the sport's changing for sure just to take that on how does the beginner get good at jujitsu like given that you're starting this white belt what's your philosophy on that obviously buy all of my instructions yeah at full price yeah not during a sale okay that would go a long way for those of you who are russians i'll give you i'll i'll send you instructions or all the forms so you know how to steal it yeah discount code i'm sure i bought them all so i'll just send it to you for free i mean we do have the makachove fifty discount code you know yeah offering discounts to help him out for the rematch i got the nice well i got a hundred percent discount for you if you need it but that said your instructional are both hilarious and brilliant man it's one of the most respected instructionals oh thank you out there with incredibly great names yeah it probably loses me sales honestly due to removing the seriousness of the things that i'm gonna kinda suck it's gonna be some funny gimmicky thing oh i mean some people don't even know if it's a real product that's a big hurdle i have to overcome as they see it and they're like is that a real thing that's a problem but how does the wipeout get good i think they just i mean they just have to show up just have to put in the effort try to focus on using techniques and training rather than just fighting to the death you know although that is entertaining for us to watch too why does it fly to the death yeah but what are the techniques you should focus on like what's the process what does it mean to show up like how much drilling all that kind of stuff like what if if you were to optimize the first six months of a of a beginner there's a lot of people who would listen to this and haven't tried they've been curious i have a lot of friends who haven't who are like just so curious they're constantly looking for an excuse to start i think it's just gotta be as simple as possible you know like we shouldn't be teaching more advanced movements i mean obviously in the grand scheme of things there's highly advanced techniques and then there's slightly advanced and i think trying to teach those guys real specific positions even like real specific types of guard it's just beyond them i think the best way to learn is through problem solving and i think if you show the technique before they've discovered that problem the learning is sort of held back so i like the idea of using kids' style games to show them a problem and then use the techniques to fix the problems they've just discovered i think that's the best way to learn can you give an example of a problem to show them before you give them the techniques like what are we talking about alright so say you wanted to teach posture in wrestling you could create a game where one guy the game might be get to a leg or get to two legs control a leg like super simple but the rules the constraint would be one guy is forced to keep upright posture and one guy is forced well not forced but he's allowed to keep a bent at the hips lower posture and obviously within the that constraint the guy with the better posture is going to have more success he's gonna have a better posture to secure a leg or secure both legs and therefore you've demonstrated the flaws of bad posture without having to explain it to them before they really tested that out okay and then the result of that you would realize that the the bent over posture is better yeah you have that moment rather than just being having it spoken to you you wrote craig i'm a big fan of constraint based learning i guess was just what you're talking about i love presenting beginners with a problem before the solution like here attempt to hold side control with no with no cues on how then i see how the guy got out and addressed issue by issue cross face and hip control and so on okay so what are some other examples like side control yeah that that would be excellent one side control like teacher like obviously we say you secure a cross face so they can't turn into you much easier to have them try to hold someone down without explaining what a cross face is and then use that technique to address the problem they've just encountered so i think you could do that with a lot of areas of jiu jitsu like even more advanced say fifty fifty obviously a a mirrored position where you both have access to each other's heels most people will stall out in that position and keep their feet crossed i think a great constraint for both of them you can't cross your feet now you have to learn how to slip the heel hook when they expose it and how to safely re attack of your own so the constraint is you can't be too defensive in that position and i think the learn the rate of learning increases why do you think the rate of learning increases like why do you think that works because you encounter more problems say in that situation they're gonna get you healed a lot more in whatever period of time you allocate the drill for than if the legs are crossed i don't think the hard part's splitting the legs to get to the submission i think the hard part's practicing control while they're trying to slip it at a later stage and then obviously trying to slip your heel when you're in more danger so it makes you more comfortable in that bad position if you're used to doing it with open legs yeah i think that probably that style of teaching forces people to focus on because it's so easy to fall into focusing on like memorizing particular details of a technique without thinking like why the hell does this even work and if you if you don't have that you could you have to focus on like from like as cliche as it sounds from first principles like why the hell how the hell do i get out of this like why does this even work why does wrestling work why do you have a bent over posture you get those like start to ask those kinds of questions which is kinda interesting because it's not obvious to me that bent over posture is is the right posture for jiu jitsu right i'm confused actually about that i don't know about the correct posture yeah for jiu jitsu like what's the right answer i think bent over posture is still good for jiu jitsu even with the judo and all that like why are so many jiu jitsu people like at a high level the posture is higher up well i think the i think wrestling posture is just a bit too low because it's not necessary right if wrestlers are like low enough to the ground where your hands could touch the mat but in jujitsu you know it's a it's kind of a mix between like wrestling and and like judo or or greco roman wrestling so i think there's just a bit more more lax then it's it's bent over but it's not upright and it's also not super low you know a bit more room for error too because obviously the jiu jitsu guy shot isn't gonna be as athletic or as quick as a wrestler especially a wrestler with shoes so it actually comes down to the fact that jiu jitsu people just on average even at the top level are not good at shooting i think so yeah i think obviously i mean all the wrestlers in american stuff they're starting super early super young you know what i mean they're they've by the time they get to the same age we are really in our sport and stuff they've spent much longer doing the actual sport than the average jiu jitsu guy and then there's another level of wrestling of course with the with the soviet block that's just unachievable for your current you an australian rugby yeah a former rugby player rugby is that kinda like american football but much less money is that what that is much less money much tougher i would say but yeah who knew that the cure to the dagestani wrestling were the aussies were the aussies okay let's go there the your your friend your training partner alexander volkanovski you helped him prepare for the islam makhachev versus volkanovski fight who do you think first of all won that fight that's a tricky one how is that the tricky question i will say when when i was the shit talk you've been doing how is that the tricky question when i was in the corner going into the fifth i personally believed live that volkanovski probably needed a a finish to take the victory but you have to think that way right in general or you like legitimately it's a gray area because the judging who knows plus i was like wait we're in australia where's this bias you know we got some australian judges here yes i was really hoping we get a bit of bias on that yeah unfortunately not hopefully they lose their jobs but again yeah it was a it was a close i think sometimes you're blinded in the moment because again everyone counted volkanovski out the crowd's behind him so everything he does is gonna get a huge cheer you're biased towards the smaller guy you're biased towards the underdog so you sort of whatever the underdog does has a bigger impact in your mind and sometimes that can bias as the fight goes along but yeah super super close fight i got i i would really love them to have a rematch but obviously that's gonna hold up both divisions so i don't know if they'll be able to do it do you think they'll do a rematch soon i mean that was an that was an epic fight i was listening to the fight companion during they all thought volks and so they biased strongly the the opinion round two is the the tricky one yeah round two is the tricky one anyway i'd love to see that like run it back and do three actually that's that's an epic fight what was the brief conversation you had with islam makhachev and his team i didn't know how he would take the joke because obviously khabib tried to fly an eagle kick dylan danis in the face mhmm so i wasn't sure how my humor would go yep but i mean dylan must have said some worse things to me i was just playing around i mean you can't really take anything i say serious yeah come across like an idiot but so so when he was coming up to me afterwards i was like oh i don't know what he's gonna say and again he maybe he would have been more upset if he had lost but he just received the judge's decision yeah but he came up i went to check his hand he gave me a big hug and then pretended to throw me mhmm and then i thought the interaction was over and then he circled back so that's why it was so awkward i was like oh he's coming back he wants to say he wants he wants something else but he just said why didn't you teach your boy how to escape the body triangle oh wow interesting what did you say to that i said well i mean obviously you've gotta learn how to finish a rear naked choke is that what you said no i didn't i was just laughing i was laughing but then they i should have sat there we're like get out of here before the aussie crowd attacks here you know what do you think about the body triangle position they were in it seemed like for the first time it's it seems almost like volk was yeah he did dominant in that position which is kinda weird i mean damage is meant to trump control mma judging damage is the number one oh do do do you think the the judges saw that who what did they score that as i think they all scored four towards islam yeah three and five neutral two of the judges scored towards volks one of the judges scored three for islam one of the it was forty nine forty six for one of them and the other ones were forty eight forty seven i think the again the confusing round was round two i don't think anyone scored the body triangle round for a volks which i wish they had volkanovski was and is still arguably pound for pound greatest fighter in the world how long have you known him i don't know the first i met him before he was in the ufc when i used to live in melbourne he came down to train at absolute yeah and then we really connected on ultimate fighter he one of his guys who's gonna bring to ultima fighter brad riddell pulled out last second so he called me when i was in puerto rico and he's like do you wanna coach on tough for five weeks and like i said puerto rico was apocalypse now i was like yeah get me out of here so i took jumped on that opportunity and we were in vegas five weeks together because he was meant to fight ortega and then he got hit with covid real bad got stuck in i think he was in hospital for maybe one to two weeks and then before he flew back to australia they were like alright maybe we just do you guys as the ultimate fighter coaches so i jumped on board with that and that's really when we've become close yeah obviously i was useful in the ortega fight i helped him get out of submissions he fought then korean zombie max holloway i basically just held the bucket at that point in the corner couple striking fights and then again yeah we had to tackle the islam problem so i did spend five to six weeks down there preparing for that how did you tackle the islam problem how do i attack was you somebody who barely knows anything about wrestling having to oh she doesn't say much you know yeah especially russian wrestling did the beard help or like what in all seriousness what were some of the key ideas you that you worked on with volkanovski to prepare for it i had the help of frank hickman hickman was down there too one of the hickman brothers wrestling coach so we were sort of like problem solving and i mean basically we were confident in volks fence wrestling his cage work he's super good on the cage super like under respected in that position and we knew that if you're able to take the scrambles to the cage he would be effective against islam because again islam is background in samba freestyle wrestling but i mean honestly he's probably got the same experience on the cage as well obviously some of those wrestling skills will translate very well to the cage but the cage is still somewhat of a gray area and equalizer and volks again incredible ability to stand up incredible defense on the cage which you saw we worked on strategies to get up and a ton of submission defense islam loves komuras obviously from the back umbas those are sort of and arm triangle's dominant submissions but again the guys he submitted not grapplers apart from charles oliveira and again charles oliveira was basically knocked out at that point so i was still impressed if he submitted him but again i always told people this they thought it was crazy i was like charles oliveira versus islam at a grappling match oliveira is gonna win that match like submission grappling submission grappling yeah so in a pure grappling skill set i think oliveira is a more dangerous grappler so we didn't even come into it thinking islam was this unstoppable boogeyman that people make him out to be so we approached her from that just focused on the techniques ability to get back up using turtle to get back up using turtle to scoot to the cage to get back up and hand fighting from there keeping it pretty safe but what makes volks so special i think is his gas tank gas tank and his willpower he's just unbreakable the dagestani guys khabib islam they are good at submissions but okay they break guys mentally and they fatigue them and then they take the submission that's offered olivera is a guy that can jump on submissions and have an incredible technical ability to finish those submissions whether you're fresh or you're tired and then you combine that with volkanovski who incredible willpower never gets tired you're never gonna break him and as you saw he only attempted once to mission the whole fire is that learned is that trained are you just born with that that mental toughness it's a good question i mean he's like an anomaly like the entire fight camp not nervous at all supremely confident the whole fight week completely confident he just has an attitude like oh everyone cast me out we will see you know what i mean islam he's like let's see no doubt no doubt at all super relaxed up until about five minutes before and then he starts to stamp himself up he's like you are not taking this bell from my family he gets into that sort of mindset he actually says that out loud you can't teach that survival he didn't even take a fight you know have you guys ever been like pushed to the limit like that or broken in a in a grappling match i'll do it in practice like i'll push myself to like you know think i might pass out or die or something like as as far as like how tired you get you know because like in a match they try not to ever get close to that in a match yeah you try to because you know you it's important to understand where your exhausted exhaustion point is but yeah if you have to push to that limit i'm actually probably do doing something wrong you know like if you like you see in matches where guys sprint the last like minute they try to win the match the last minute and it's like you definitely had some mistakes leading up to that if you have to you know kinda go balls to wall okay but has there been other times in competition especially like early on because you're like you wrestled pretty hard and wrestling is pretty exhausting like not wrestling but you know wrestling style kinda thing and going against the peep best people in the world yeah i mean i definitely again i think i think in practice it's important to do that hard work that way competition is is is much easier you know i think if you if you redline in practice and you you really pushed it like death's door then once you're in competition and you you're you're working with you know you're being fresh in in a compliment it's it's much better have you ever been to that thing where dan gable talks about always wanting to be to a place where you can't get off the mat like you work so hard in the training room you can't get off the mat i think he says he's failed at that in his career he was always able to at least crawl off the mat yeah i definitely never like actually died on the mat but i felt like i felt like i was gonna die you know sure sure what about you do you quit all the time i get a lot cramp i'm like you know what you got me man let's do this again tomorrow dude if i'm asking craig for a role he's in the bathroom somewhere are you do you do you see the value of pushing yourself like to that place where you're knocking on death's or yeah but it within safety you know because obviously the most serious injuries occur when you're tired over training and stuff like that so i think like taking a page out of what those mma fighters do especially volks with his training like he's not necessarily pushing crazy in each round but he's doing extra conditioning assault bike stuff crazy workouts outside and he does do some crazy training workouts but all safe very safe like when he's redlining like that in the training room it's a very controlled safe setting i think to do that in jiu jitsu against some of these lunatics out there that are trying to kill you especially when you have a name can be dangerous so your approach to jiu jitsu is don't warm up and don't try too hard no sir for safety no for safety yeah yeah longevity you know and talk shit to about russians i got it i got it i hear you oh you mentioned cage work what what what's interesting to you that you've learned over all this time about cage work what's like what's interesting about the dynamics of that are you talking about both like the control in the dominant position but also getting up from the bottom while you're at against the cage all of that the added dimension of that cage that wall being there changes a lot of stuff right so obviously in some ways it's a much lower impact wrestling style because you can't be strode on you can shoot the cage is gonna block their feet you're gonna be able to chase down their hips it's just a completely different fight and again because of islam's judo skills that upper body controls you see he's able to use against the cage like the inside trips sort of the style haraigoshi throws so obviously those skills do translate but yeah i think the cage is a great equalizer for a lot of things like athleticism and stuff it takes away a huge speed advantage aspects of the fight so he's really good at standing up what is is there i assume he learned all of that from you and your instructional just stand up i mean we were so confident i was like you know what why don't we put this thing out a month before the fight yeah maybe the illegal download hasn't made its way to russia yet yeah but it was there for him him can you can you explain to me what's in the instructional just stand up like what what are the what are the ideas what are the i mean the old school way to stand up people talk about the technical get up you know the old gracie put the hand but i mean that's that doesn't work it hasn't worked for twenty years you know if you look at everyone that gets up in mma they're using turtle to get up they're using wrestling to get up mhmm you know what i mean yeah which is counter to what pure jiu jitsu says they say don't expose the back don't ever expose your back i think jiu jitsu is a terrible way to get back to the feet because if you were to retain guarding a half guard or closed guard super hard positions to get up you're basically putting yourself in a leg tilt for wrestling so i think you need to borrow from wrestling to learn how to get up in an mma fight so basically how to safely expose your own back while not allowing them to get hooks and use that to get back up or at least not allow them to get two hooks and that applies for mma especially for mma especially because obviously striking is a factor but if they are striking they don't have locked hands around your body means you are able to move you are able to make an attempt to get back up they have to choose between control submission or strikes post from reddit why does craig jones push so hard for a bottom is bad jujitsu what is so bad about playing bottom guard such as half guard or delahia those are the two options no one likes the bottom why would i want to get up it's the question for all of you is is the bottom a bad place to be i mean the bottom's bad if you don't want that gun to help you that's the way i look at it you know yeah that's that's it sounds like something a cowboy would say but i don't know if there's much meaning i i think the point of jiu jitsu is both are dangerous being on bottom and on top i think the longer the match is probably favorites top guy more just because every movement the bottom guy makes probably carrying your your weight carrying that gravity on top of you so i think it's a bit more efficient passing from the top as opposed to sweeping from bottom bottom's reactive top is active the top player decides how to engage how to approach the guard they can use angles they can use footwork they can throw people throw the legs by so it's a active position bottom's reactive reactive you're gonna get fatigued yeah i think i think it's very difficult to gas somebody out while playing guard but i think it's very easy to gas somebody out when attempting to pass it well you guys are talking about gassing people out but is there more dangers from the bottom like in terms of submissions and all that kind of stuff or no i'm back and forth because i'm a top i'm a top player but i understand the value of being on bottom like when i do play guard bottom i feel like the the submissions come much easier and when i'm on top they come also pretty easy but maybe i just take a different route top top on you cowboys talking about shit it's up on the straights but i'm in the shades sesame what was the hardest part of the training for the the training camp for volkanovski like you're just experiencing world class mma fighters training and given your approach of to jiu jitsu of not trying too hard and no matter what yeah yeah i mean from my perspective there's a lot of pressure for that you know like that's a that's that's a lot of pressure for me to go in and think that i could possibly figure out a way to help this guy address this guy that's basically never been beaten i think he got knocked out once but basically not really even been put in bad positions you know what i mean so that's a lot of pressure on me especially because volkanovski is such a great guy yeah jujitsu is different you know like you coach a guy who loses he has time to tap but in mma he gets severely hurt yeah there's a lot more weight in what you need to do as a coach you have a greater sense of responsibility to their health and well-being you know like obviously i know fox kids i know his wife you know what i mean they're putting faith in you to not just win the fight but keep this man safe you know so from my perspective a hell of a lot more pressure coaching him as an mma fighter so almost like the psychological aspect of like of doing the best you can for him exactly yep yep what was what was the hardest about the actual training was it the technical aspect of trying to figure out the puzzle of islam or was it like being a good training partner in the like in figuring out how the grappling would work basically playing your best impression of makhachev were you trying to actually impersonate him like not not not just visually but like in style yeah definitely definitely visually you're not as good looking but go ahead yeah a little taller but no in terms of the training yeah i mean islam's known as incredibly strong guys obviously i'm heavier than islam so theoretically i should be able to replicate that strength difference and then in terms of grappling targeting those submissions that islam does like focusing on those in the training room focusing on the way he holds half guard and really foe in the grappling sense trying to replicate him on the ground and then yeah i wrestle with him on the wall a ton trying to replicate obviously to the best of my ability a lot of the stuff he does on the wall body lock heavy inside trip uchimadas and just constantly putting the work on vox you know what i mean like constantly chaining attacks against him really replicating that he's trying to get up and escape and all that kind of stuff so all this submissions like both judo and submissions just attack and attack exactly and there's only so much you can do really because obviously he's been i think he's he's been fighting a long time so it's like you're trying to polish what he already is good at you can't just completely create entirely new game for him in the space of six weeks so you're trying to take what he's already effective at add to it and luckily a lot of the stuff he's already very good at was easy to add to for the for the fight question from reddit i'm very curious why other mma fighters don't employ high profile grapplers from b team and new wave to improve their grappling that's from the subreddit by now it's clear that they are levels above almost everyone in mma simply because fighters there don't specialize in grappling but it doesn't seem like fighters even champions get training partners from the most successful teams why is that the case from your experience why doesn't kabib call you he might now yeah put in a good word for me oh oh i will yeah that's right he takes a joke pretty well yeah no no you'll be walking with with open arms this is i think your average jiu jitsu coach mma fighters have bad experience with jiu jitsu guys jiu jitsu doesn't have a massive place in mma obviously rounds stand ups it's hard hard to submit people your average brazilian jiu jitsu black belt doesn't know anything about holding a guy down doesn't know anything about how to stand up sure so i think if you over overly utilize that jiu jitsu guy that hasn't had experience in more modern no gi or training mma fighters previously it's gonna be a complete waste of time to him i think they're smart enough to realize that do you have and do you guys do you have interest in mma at all just not even like well certainly just competing yourself but like just understanding the puzzle of mma yeah i mean i i've been a fan of mixed martial arts you know for a very long time you know before i i trained jits personally i personally i'd i'd much rather coach than fight but i mean i'd fight somebody for you know a good check and i get to pick the opponent you know have a proper camp okay i could think of a good atlanta yeah which dude who's that alright who do you think is the greatest mma fighter of all time craig we could start with you just as a fan of the sport as somebody who's been deep in it i mean from my perspective after that performance i'm gonna say volkanovski because he was able to decisively outstrike max holloway one of the greatest strikers in the sport yeah and he was able to hang with the wrestling of islam makhachev and in terms of ortega he was able to survive ortega who has some of the most dangerous submissions in jiu jitsu so i think in my opinion technically he's the best so even though even though he technically lost he still he still has the crown i believe so given the size difference given he's moving up in weight i think all those factors really the underdog everything the pressure did you think he would be able to hang in any of the wrestling exchanges with islam no no no i was really surprised it's well it's that's why in my eyes like it's kinda funny like winning at the end of the day i feel like judges influenced that although i did think australian judges would would rob the other way but i was assuming they kinda somebody paid somebody and not enough maybe but but in general i just thought he won sort of in the eyes of what martial arts stands for like sort of go into the fire and survive and and thrive and finish the last round strong which is kind of is like spiritually is what a victory is so i wish we kept going like one more rounds yeah exactly that kinda thing what about you what do you think like who are the fighters you admire like who do you think is the greatest of all time i think the fighter i paid most attention to was jon jones you know he has a great ability just to mix the the high level striking high level grappling although his you know jiu jitsu by itself isn't you know probably isn't like you know super high level but his ability to mix everything together i would say he's he's the best and he's a fellow you know heavier guy heavyweight now so it's it's nice to see you know how those guys move at that weight and a fellow natural athlete see what i did there alright alright what about what about you nikki yeah if i had to pick a goat i would probably have to say khabib just because he was he was undefeated and he had a very you know high finishing rate you know very few of his fights actually went to a decision yeah so he just overall he dominated almost every single opponent he went against the dominance i mean we we've been joking about it but craig what do you think makes the dagestani fighter so good like from this small region of the world so much dominance has come i mean obviously the amount of freestyle wrestling champions from that region probably puts their wrestling above and beyond the best in all of mma and obviously a lot of even in olympics a lot of champions out of there right so i think that skill set combines with them adding effective pin controls on the ground and jiu jitsu submissions but i mean again i think it's that hard training those guys like khabib would maintain that pressure throughout the entire fight and break guys down their ability to fatigue guys to a breaking point i think is something they do best but i wonder what what that is what is that technique what is that what is it about their upbringing because it's that just that part of the world over the satir brothers with for the other freestyle wrestling side to all the mixed martial arts people like they it must be part of the the culture also they must be doing something i don't think i've never i haven't seen a convincing explanation of why yet of what's specific about their training what's specific about their culture that creates that okay what do you think about like the the flip side do you admire somebody like conor mcgregor who knows how to create a spectacle you craig who likes spectacles spectacles yeah i mean i really admired early conor mcgregor because i found him absolutely hilarious you know like i i felt like that was peak banter i feel like he just took the american world by storm aussies british irish kiwis i believe we have a way better level of banter and attacking each other yeah and it's almost too easy to pick on americans to take themselves very seriously i mean arguably even other parts of the world too the far east of europe you know well that's the that's the tricky thing with with connor i think he was i feel like you could have gotten in the same kind of trouble because the russians really took everything very seriously they weren't joking around yeah that's that's the problem it's like it's it's it's a bit of i mean some things he definitely takes too far you know but i felt like early on he had the right balance where he wouldn't really cross the line but he would do he would do enough he just took it to another level obviously later in his career but i think early on bit of innocent banter it gets a lot of eyes in the sport though it's probably the by far the most popular combat athlete of all time because of that yeah i feel like you have to cross the line i don't think enough people appreciate like the values he's brought by crossing the line he's making a sacrifice crossing the line that's gonna affect him for the rest of his life you know i see i don't think so i think he can always walk back because i think unlike people might disagree with this i well yeah i i thought he always radiated a respect for the opponent like afterwards and underneath it it felt like the same way you do it when i hear you shit talking i don't see a person who really means it i see a person who's having fun with it i always saw conor mcgregor the same way i don't know and then but people took it like extremely seriously but i i saw respect the martial artists have for each other that felt like it was always there if you don't like that individual you're gonna perceive yeah yeah what they say more negatively than if you obviously were so like i feel like if you like someone you're gonna never think they really cross the line that's true so you're saying i like you that's what i'm perceiving must be you're bullshit in the past of your life is there are there people that hate you you get the one i mean some of the family members stable people that really get to know you all hate you alright alright the fans love me their friends hate me it's a good place to be keep your enemies close alright what do you think is the most important muscle for digesters is it biceps oh i think a strong i think a strong back i think back one core second and then biceps okay biceps cool wait do you do you legitimately think like weightlifting helps jiu jitsu it's kind of the discussion on the steroids it's like the muscle mass and strength and power and explosiveness all of that i think sometimes when we're at that upper echelon of competition there's there's only there's like little minute battles that you have to win and if you're if you're relatively close in technique then a lot of times a stronger opponent pulls it out but it could be also just a limitation right you you hold position too long what about for hobbyists do you recommend weightlifting like when you see people in the gym i always recommend weightlifting i i almost see muscle as the body's armor right the the more armor you have the more damage you could kinda take and you know maybe recovery is a little bit better and i've always seen weight lifting as a means to stick to my routine like if there's no point in lifting if you're not eating right and you're not sleeping right so if you kinda put it all together then it's it's beneficial what about you guys do you go do you go to the gym i go to the gym yeah do you go like a hotel gym to like an elliptical and that butt machine or yeah i focus on the glutes heavily alright what about like what about injury prevention and so on how do you train to minimize the risk of injury you guys have all been pretty beat up you've gotten a major injury with the acl yeah so how do you train to minimize injury probably not the right guy to ask definitely can you talk through your injury like what happened yeah so about one week prior to this last adcc i was i was wrestling with this guy named kenta who was also competing and i went to go lift him from like a rear body lock and he hooked the outside of my leg and we just felt something pop you know he felt a shift with his with his leg and when it first happened it hurt for like the first thirty seconds and then i honestly debated i was like maybe it was just you know some freak thing i was like i literally thought about continuing the session then the next day i woke up and i was like super sore i was you know limping around couldn't couldn't do a full squat so it pretty much killed all of my training for the entire week leading up to the event so i couldn't train or anything messed up the cut obviously there's there's added nerves with that too you know when you're not in the gym every day leading up to the competition i went out there i wasn't really able to pull guard because i couldn't get you know full heel to butt connection which is inevitable with playing guard and i was very hesitant to shoot as well so i came out with the idea of just trying to use hand fighting to to tire my first opponent out and then mainly look to get to underhooks or or overhooks and do mostly upper body wrestling in the beginning of the match i you know successfully got to an underhook i got to a rear body lock he tried to roll and i ended up in top position in side control but it was during the no points period and then as the match went on i gassed out and eventually he ended up taking me down and then scoring with with two hooks on the back so what's the injury yeah so i got an mri actually after the event i didn't know waited wait wait you waited until after the event yeah i waited until after the event knowledge or or ignorance is bliss is that exactly i was like i honestly i don't even wanna know what's wrong i was like i'd just go out there compete you know i knew it was like the the biggest event to date and i really wanted to do it think about not doing it it definitely was a thought in my head especially that that the day after you know it's always the worst day whenever you have like a serious injury is the day after and i was like man i really can't do a full squat i was like i don't even know how i'm gonna be able to do this it it got a bit better over as the the week went on but i was like man i i have to go out there and compete i was like it'll always be in the back of my mind like what if if i ended up pulling out what did you think about this hole i thought it was just me and i posted it yeah just slap him around just yell at him it was like that i didn't think we pressured you we just let you make your own decision right we're just like mine is a tricky thing to do like with a heavily like like a serious injury like this we didn't know that was the thing we didn't know honestly initially i thought it was i tore my lateral meniscus but that ended up not being the case it ended up being a full acl tear i was actually super surprised when i got the mri results so yeah we we didn't know how bad it actually was what do you think about that situation i think nikki's a tough kid and i mean when you're so close to that competition you know there's not many you don't get many opportunities like that to compete in front of you know fifteen thousand people it's like you know props to you for pushing through it and and getting it and man he had a close match with one of the best grapplers in his weight classes like you know a few adjustments here and there and especially you know if he was able to train pre previously leading up to that match i think that he pulls it out so some of the things you mentioned is nerves so there's extra nerves just because you're underprepared yeah i mean you know feeling underprepared you wanna go into a competition with you know the confidence i did everything that i could leading up to this event i trained as much as i could and then when an injury prevents that you start to doubt yourself more how do you guys think about injury how do you train you know training with the best in the world training to be the best in the world and avoiding injury because you've gotten you tore your bicep yeah yeah i tore bicep girls or dude honestly i i was i was a body bodybuilding you know for like seven years and no lie i did i trained biceps like most days like almost that almost every day in those seven years pretty much i injured my i injured myself that's so jersey man anything else or just the bicep just i mean yeah i injured the bicep pretty much i the day before a wrestling practice i had like a a killer arm day and by arm day i just mean training biceps so every very rigorously getting a sick pump and i go to wrestling practice the next day you know know pretty late i should have been there i didn't get a proper warm up in and the first thing i do is i shake hands and i go to shoot a single leg and boom i just blew my arm out the the first movement i did so just not being warmed up properly in addition to you know having a very vigorous arm day few hours prior you hear the you hear that about warm up so like what what are some lessons about avoiding injury and training it i would say number one is is warming up properly make sure making sure your your body is hot before you do hot stuff okay and what what does warm up look like for you is it jiu jitsu or non jiu jitsu stuff yeah just for a warm up in general i'll do i'll do something like a if i'm talking competition something like a a jog walk back and forth a few times then a sprint jog a few times to get that heart rate you know up and down yeah and then i'll grab a partner i actually just filmed the dvd or instructional specifically on the pre match ritual in addition to that i'll i'll you know grab a partner i'll drill some some movements typically i'll drill some bad things like i'll start from bottom bottom out bottom side control work out from there and in pretty much like twenty minutes in i'm i'm hot and i'm ready to go for you know rounds what about you greg so what what's what's the way to avoid injury what's the worst injury you've had what's the worst injury i don't even know i'm pretty good pretty healthy yeah whenever you whenever you quit practice i'm gonna have some mental issues have you has your heart ever been broken oh many times many times but there's a thing i notice people that spend the most time warming up often the most injured it's a strong correlation i can't you can't argue with science i remember would be right training with all of the tasks all of the tasks would have a sixty minute warm up yeah surprise surprise always injured yeah yeah very common yeah i find that very common in the training room now i think people it's how they train like if you like me first sign of discomfort backpedal you know push through that stuff go too hard go when you're too tired you know what i mean get too emotional in the role i feel like those are the times that i've been hurt where i just like oh i can't let this guy get me when i have that attitude and try i believe it's how you train and sort of obviously so what does this come from like positionally too like because you're training against some killers i mean you're you're training you're training you're training with him and going probably pretty hard once a month gets a little tired he's like yeah i'm good for today we go once a month with nikki that's it yeah and then you quit like thirty seconds in just so you know yeah you know you gotta be safe you know i like it what what about you what have you learned from the acl oh with tara through rehab yeah yeah rehab definitely would help oh so you haven't been like i didn't get surgery i didn't do essentially any rehab i just have no acl in my left leg so what's it like having no surgeon guys you've got two options surgery rehab only nikki goes i'll do nothing yeah definitely should pick up on the rehab what's what's rehab for that look like like twice a day of doing some weird yeah like bands or something it's good he's learned from he's he's learned some valuable lessons from yeah about taking care of his body yeah what's it like just training with no acl so at the beginning i was definitely a little iffy you know i would have an occasional buckle like i'd just be wrestling with somebody and go to step back and it'd buckle backwards a bit but honestly now like i haven't had a single buckle instance in a while it feels a hundred percent normal when i train it feels better than my other knee to be honest like i had i had my meniscus taken out in my right leg and that one gets sore more often than the the no acl leg okay alright so putting that aside is there like is there wisdom you've learned from that experience yeah definitely should be doing rehab and and prehab you know i think that you know especially if you're a hobbyist or or or a professional athlete you should be lifting you know whether you're rehabbing an injury or just for injury prevention so i'm actually closer to craig because i i've trained my whole life like pretty hard obviously just a hobbyist but like twice a day did judo wrestling all that never broke anything never injured kinda like similar philosophy except like last year i guess a year and a half ago i got a tiny like groin pull injury and it still hasn't healed and i've been using your approach of not giving a shit yeah and like alright surely this is gonna heal it'll be fine but it hasn't but of course if i was like an actual athlete i would like probably still train through it and just fuck it figure it out but when you have other stuff going on you just kinda wait it out yeah but no i think probably we have especially as you get older you have to do that kind of stuff i think it's important for people to you know determine whether they're what they're going through is an an injury or they're just hurt a little bit because injury you know for sure take time rehab it and get better but a lot of people like they'll stub a toe or something like you're out for a few weeks you know so well that's that's the problem with the injury i have it feels like a stubbed toe so i was like actually i'll just wait a couple days it'll be fine and then a couple days later it's not fine and you wait and then i never got an mri never got any of that it's like i'm sure i'll be be fine yeah so it's hard to know sometimes like what it's hard to know i feel like a lot of people will just not check it out it'll be fine well to because there's several failure cases there is a failure case of where everything is a stubbed tote you're like fuck it like like you're bleeding everywhere you know that's fine whatever so you have to be careful a lot a lot of a lot of people can fall into that too i think i'm in that category go to the doctor why do you go to the doctor yeah your best approach is typically wait until something else gets hurt so that you'll forget about the grain that's yeah exactly that's what i was hoping i was hoping to get hurt so waiting for the for the broken heart maybe so okay so that that was very helpful oh you mentioned you're doing a a a a whole thing on the pre match ritual can you kinda preview like what kind of what's involved in your pre match ritual it's pretty big in the wrestling culture and the fighting culture like kind of what what to do before your competition but i think a few of our a few people are just kinda missing out exactly you know what to do so i break it down for them i break it down to people like four weeks in advance how how you're you should prep you know your trading and your nutrition and your sleep for competition in addition to that i break it down even like to a smaller scale for like what how how early you should get to the event when you're when you should be visualizing you know your competition what to do like you know thirty minutes before twenty minutes ten minutes five minutes and the kind of mentality you should have throughout those those times before you actually step onto the mat when are you visualizing like how much are you visualizing the act when you say competition you're talking about the the the tournament or the actual people you might be competing against a little bit of both i'll spend time just visualizing the crowd like if if it's gonna be you know an arena with fifteen thousand people i'll spend time in practice and whatnot like putting myself inside that arena and and visualizing you know stepping on the mat and hearing the hearing the crowd scream and whatnot that way you know when competition comes time comes it's kind of the the same deal i'm accustomed to it in addition when i get to the arena i'll step on the mat i'll i'll kind of look at everything i'll expose my senses to to what it's gonna be and then i'll kinda shut everything off like a lot some people you know scroll through their phone and can treat treat it like normal have this normal conversations for me i i like to limit my sensory input my sensory intake before i go out and compete i just feel like sometime i feel like sometimes we only have so many decisions you can make in a day and i want all of my best decisions to be made when it matters when it counts what about you what's do you limit your sensory input on game day honestly no routine nothing mhmm i don't know yeah i don't do anything i'm just like guys are double silver we're both double you should get it you should buy us in structural it might help you i'll get another silver no honestly nothing hey i just try to relax treat your legs before training have a good try to visualizations or no no i do visual visualization so the opposite of visualization you just avoid it yeah before thinking about it yeah i don't even think about it i'm just like yeah we'll have a good time you know try to appreciate it but i can do it by the way when you visualize are you visualizing tough positions or you visualize winning mostly definitely visualize winning i'll visualize how i can get how i'm gonna get to my most dominant positions because you know in comp i wanna do what i'm best at i'm also see i see my opponent in his best positions and how i'm gonna escape those if necessary but most of the time i'm just visualizing exactly what i'm gonna do in that match and i go out there and do it okay so what when when when your teammate craig is you know another like world class athlete has a fundamentally different philosophy than you do you visualize being frustrated at him not no not frustrated but i'll definitely come into practice with like solutions to to problems that craig gives me you know like if craig's craig's you know catching me at something or giving me issues like you know i'll go home i'll i'll watch a a match that he lost for motivation and i'll come back and i'll i'll put it on just just dm him like a highlight reel of him losing yep what about you like does it does it affect you that you're a bit of an outlier usually before i compete right before i go out there i go why am i doing this yeah do i still need to do this yeah and i think like hopefully don't embarrass myself affect my instructional sales that's the last thought but i don't even put too much thought into the whole competing thing i'm just like you know what train hard hopefully have a good time out there what about the motivation aspect like that that voice that says like why am i doing this that voice can break a lot of people like in a weight cut it can break a lot of people like why am i doing this stupid silly sport like you said a bunch of dudes just rolling around like what's the point i'll call someone with a nine to five job and i'll be like yeah that's why i'm doing this k you know avoid that sure sell those dvds man yeah i didn't get too deep on competing yeah we're so polar opposite it's like almost uncomfortable to be around here obviously one of us is a clean athlete you should do a dvd on that what what what about you in terms of preparing for competition ricky the the day before the day of are there rituals that you follow honestly like the the few days leading up to it i it's different for me every time like sometimes i'll warm up before the i compete sometimes i won't sometimes i'll fast sometimes i'll eat so i literally it's just completely random i don't follow any specific thing but in the training room leading up to the competition i'll definitely you know like nikki rod visualize that i'm walking out onto the competition mats you know i'll pick somebody that's you know a similar body type to the person that i'm competing against and then you know we'll start out with some distance between us we'll come out smack hands and you know act like everything's a real competition i'll even sometimes have you know corners that will yell out times and things like that just to replicate it as much as possible that's funny because i've talked to a lot of olympic gold medalists i used to do a podcast with like athletes and they all sound like nicky rod the two of you are outliers i don't know sometimes i'll do this sometimes so anyway but that's also just a culture i think maybe the chaos of not taking things too serious is actually really really helpful sometimes the pressure of taking everything way too too seriously can break you i i mean it's just i don't think it's that biggest sport really you know like i think if i compete every day in practice it just make competition much easier so so i i just put the pressure on there on the competition yeah yeah on the sorry on the training on the competing in the training i don't know olympic sports aren't that big either financially and people take it extremely extremely seriously like you don't really even get get that much money from judo i mean i just don't take jiu jitsu that seriously because like i was just partying having a good time until twenty one and then i was like oh fuck do i get a job or do i pursue professional sports and i feel like if i can make a career in jiu jitsu with that with a decision at that point and now you just stumbled your way somehow into like being at the top of the world yeah that's what i feel like i just walked into it i feel like i couldn't just do that in wrestling boxing i couldn't do that in other sports what was the toughest match you ever had that pushed you mentally physically technically this doesn't have to be the best person you face but was there like a moment in your career that was like really defining for you i mean i would say like the toughest mentally was just this this last adcc you know i just had a a big injury leading into it that kind of screwed the whole camp and and weight cutting everything up so i yeah i would say i would say the last adcc are you proud of your performance there like you stepped on the mat that you you pushed through all of it like i said i'm a very competitive person and i hate losing so definitely not yeah you gotta collapse long kick your way i actually elaborate on this oh man dude he was he was so physically exhausted afterwards couldn't breathe we had to get medical intervention he thought he had a collapse on so he was the most tired that i've ever been in my life in that match i actually popped the blood vessel in my eye i was trying so hard he he comes out he walks off the adcc mat backstage and i'm like i'm kinda getting warmed up for my match and nikki run comes he walks over huffing and puffing his his mom's right next to me he looks at her he was like i think i need help i think i was a lung collapse that's true dude that was fucking not true my mom's the one that called for medical care oh okay okay just laying on the warm up mat fucking dying well we're happy you're fine not bad too working long laid it all on the line what about you craig defining or toughest matches mhmm i mean they're all pretty tough you know i don't know i can't really pinpoint one i mean probably the most annoying one was obviously the one where i had gordon and amber i was like tap bro and he wouldn't tap yeah so i let him out mentally i was like i shouldn't have done that do you ever have a thing in your brain where it says should i should talk now or not and you ever you say no i'm gonna be respectful i just don't like be serious yeah about some of these things i don't know it's just silly it's just yeah all of it the whole thing what about you nikkyra dude honestly most of my toughest matches are are in the the training room right because i started with these guys i started training under them like you know start training at dds when i didn't have any knowledge like of like i knew wrestling i knew like a knee cut in jiu jitsu but like i started training with them when i knew almost no jiu jitsu and then i had to like you know really work my way up so definitely in the training room like being like having one of these guys on my back or like there's a stretch of like a few weeks or months when covid first hit and there was just like four of the best grapplers in the world and we just did drilling in live rounds with these four guys and it was just it was it was hard it was very hard you know every every round doing six rounds seven days a week with the best grapplers in the world and it's like you get no break and you're forced to learn on the go so i think in the for me in the training room that was definitely my my toughest matches and that's where i built you know those mental calluses there was a period where i i drew with nikki rod probably what nine months twelve months and typically speaking like i said no warm ups the first round we usually take it pretty easy first round you start in mount the whole room the rest of the training room they take mount very lightly me and nicky rod would be fighting to the death every day i felt like we did an extra round every day mhmm it was very grueling on my mind i'm very mean when i'm in the midst of drilling or or lie or live like we would do we would drill wrestling you know quite a bit like stand up and in the drilling like i just wouldn't let craig take me down like we're we're not gonna lie we're just drilling but i just wouldn't let him put me on the floor so things like that you know i know it escalate yeah so you mentioned mount like so you do positional training so is that would that be the hardest versus like live training open like starting from guard i would say mount and turtle definitely definitely made me very tough because you've spent all this effort getting off of bottom mount and then you gotta get on top of the guy in the at the time i'm not that good at holding guys down so they escape quick and i'm like fuck i just tried to hold them down gotta go back down same thing with the turtle it's like you you start bottom turtle you try to explode get out get away and then you know you switch and this guy get up gets up pretty quick and you're like damn i gotta go right back down it was that constant circle man it's it's very tough but definitely you know build some character on the mat what do you think is the value of positional training in general in jiu jitsu actually this one just interacting with you guys it's not commonly done in just like regular jiu jitsu gyms what do you see because probably it's not commonly done because it's so most of the experience is just frustrating mhmm like if you're evenly matched you're basically frustrated the whole time if you're if you're doing it right it's a psychological battle that happens in like the mountain turtle rounds it's like you know because you maybe you get close to subbing a guy and or maybe you do sub them you know when you start on turtle and you're on their back you finish them and then you get this high point and then immediately you gotta go back down to defensive posture yeah and it's very like it's emotionally like up and down so it's hard to deal with super important if you're one of the better people in the gym because it just puts you in positions you don't find yourself in in regular training so i think like a lot of if you're a big fish in a small pond and you don't do positional sparring you're probably gonna get exposed in competition you might even look silly in those positions so you really have to force yourself to do it despite the fact that you're giving someone worse than you a position where they might catch you so you have to sorta put the ego aside yeah that's one one of the things is when i was training regularly of course training with you guys it's like trivial but but i didn't work on putting myself in bad positions when you get better and you regret it because the the the big negative thing it has consequence it has on competition is you don't take as many risks because you're kind of afraid for your back to get taken all that kind of stuff that was me before i went to dds i remember i showed up there in that old position i was like fuck this yeah you better earn this position you know yeah exactly i didn't really have escapes that was a learning curve for me for sure do you see the value in positional training or is it just the source of tremendous frustration yeah i definitely think it plays a big part in you know your confidence when you step out onto the the competition mats you know being confident that even if you get put in the worst possible situations you know what to do and know how to work out of them so i had a long argument with with haja gracie when he visited and he thinks mal is the most dominant position even nogi versus beck would you is there a case to be made for that or no do you think i think all of your opponents' utensils their tools are in front of them so like if you're on mount they still have you know there's a few ways to get out of mount i think if you're on somebody's back i'd personally much rather be on somebody's back than flattened out i'd rather have someone's back and then flattened out boots in flattened out yeah yeah boots in flattened out so not not even body triangle but just flattened just completely flat almost like the position of mma where you see guys get finished because they can't get out i think that position is probably the hardest position to escape can you see what hodges talking about with mount or is he just that good at mount that he says that he might mean the gi cross collar you know i don't know or did he mean he says controlling wise he he just believes that you can complete that there's he actually thinks there's more ways to get out from the back than there is from the mount prior to getting up including like physically prior to the keeping escape i'll probably agree with him but that keeping escape is so difficult to manage it's the funny looking escape where yeah yeah legs are always when people have a lot of trouble it's like super hard to learn how to do but then once you learn how to do it the effectiveness is just huge yeah it's a weird one when did that come to be a thing is that pretty recent i i mean i saw dds guys using it first i think yeah yeah who who's the first guy to discover something like that this seems like a ridiculous thing to discover yeah what if i just wiggle i thought it was a joke at first i was are you guys really doing this yeah alright i remember somebody showing me like a tech technique where like if you just like walk your hand on a mat or something like that like an arm triangle or something yeah yeah yeah walk the arm behind the arm arm high and it's just like a funny discovery like as opposed to like trying to like shove it in just like walk it i like doing that to people but with things that aren't true you know what i mean i'll just tell them this is a technique and watch them try to work out if i'm being serious or not yeah that's what you do when you achieve guru status they'll just listen to you like you're steven seagal see what they'll believe speaking of which how do you balance you have to travel all across the world how do you balance that with running a school or being a world class jiu jitsu athlete oh maybe i mean the secrets of travel for me are two two drugs xanax and modafinil mhmm that's how we time adjust and we hit the ground running but what does modafinil do xanax puts him sleep my friend i i mean i have narcolepsy it's a narcolepsy medication but it's like how does that work with the steroids how does it work i mean they work well together you know yep nice focus and physical recovery but in terms of traveling and training and stuff it is i mean we're lucky because we got so many high level guys so we can we can travel and they're still still in good hands i mean there would be a problem if me nicky rida and nicky rida left and the gym had ethan that would be a problem yeah but we gotta make sure it's not just him there although everyone says they're happy when you're gone so that's the moment i heard happy when i'm gone but they do miss me yeah for sure until i get back alright what about what about you just like balancing it do you try to stay completely focused on competing like for some of the big matches you have coming up are you able to kinda diversify well i like the yeah diversify my training to where you know if i'm don't have a competition scheduled i'm more focused on skill development and you know getting better and broadening broadening my tool shed but you know if i'm like six weeks before comp i really start amping up the intensity that i bring into the mats against bringing some of that visual visualization towards practice and maybe i train less volume pre competition but higher output per session yeah what is what what's a perfect week of training look like if i'm not in if i'm not in competition mode i would say monday wednesday friday twice every other day just once if i'm pre comp just monday monday to sunday once a day so that's on the mat you're doing the full like positional training live training bicep curls bicep oh yeah i do a lot of bicep curls yeah i lift a few times a week now yeah yeah yeah cardio or no cardio is all in that stuff cardio is all in that stuff i do i do do some crossfit workouts like crossfits i'll do like some emoms or or some amrabs or crossfit you know terms that's for instagram yeah but yeah cross crossfit is a is a good way to kind of like push that that threshold sometimes on the mat because i'm i'm so good i can't always get that that like full red line so i hop in across the gym and i'll do some workouts that you know bring me closer to death what what about you craig what what does a perfect week in training look like like when you're back home training i try to be at the gym twice a day every day when i'm back just because i travel a bit more than these guys so i try to be there eight and twelve every day hang out in between usually definitely usually train both of those sessions depending on how my body feels so doing positional doing every like technique positional live i should probably do more positional because i'm just trying to work on wrestling and stuff and especially leading up to the volkanovski's last while i was trying to wrestle more and focus on those areas even before i traveled over there just some experimentation with some stuff but yeah yeah how do you how do you experiment with stuff like how do you so there's like regular positional stuff but when you have ideas like what like where do you do it in during the training sessions or do it outside of that do you get do you get together with somebody usually every session i show up with something i'm thinking of usually something from top maybe something from bottom but and then i just try to maybe pick the right people some people obviously i'm just fighting to the death with it's not a good time to experiment and then others obviously you can you can play around with ideas on okay what about you what's a perfect week look like maybe well you said you're a hundred percent now yeah so yeah honestly i have pretty much the same schedule as nikki rod so monday wednesday friday i do twice a day every other day once a day and then normally noon practice is like our biggest class that's where you know all the pros go in so i tend to do more open rounds there and then we have a seven pm class as well which is more hobbyist and that's where i'll do my positional rounds and you know force myself to be put in bad positions so you have what you do eight am twelve like in terms of what b team has eight am twelve seven pm and the hobbyists are more seven pm yes okay do you believe in overtraining do you think you can overtrain i used to not believe in it but i then i got hurt i was like alright oh you attribute that to overtraining not the bicep i think dude i'm telling you i trained i lifted like a bodybuilder for like seven years and by lifting i mean i was lifting seven days a week and i train arms most days like almost almost every day i would do like you know four or five sets and get a get a pretty good bicep pump you know in addition to my lift i think i that had to contribute somewhat toward towards my like my training fair enough well what about on on the actual mat overtraining i explained too much time on the mat well i psychological physical overtraining i think you can definitely overtrain but it's more of a like as your body's healthy you have to make sure your mind is sharp like sometimes maybe taking a a day away or even even diverting your attention in in a different aspect of training can help you be a little bit sharper overall sometimes it can be like it can get a little like stagnant because you're doing the same stuff over and over but i think if you just keep like you know overtraining then your overall baseline just gets higher and you that become you become you know accustomed to that what about you you don't seem like a guy that over okay i've heard of it never been close to it no i think controlling how hard you train is definitely protects you from injury you know what i mean like if you're redlining yourself and then you're fighting to the death in the gym that's a hundred percent when you're gonna get injured gonna get sick so i try to make sure i've i've had enough sleep i've had obviously enough food post training and that sort of helps me to train a bit harder but still try to avoid redlining myself too much i think established also like what days are gonna be your peak days because you're either out the week if you're training seven days a week you're gonna have ups and downs like for me personally when they when wednesday thursday friday usually my best days and besides that i also have other great days all my days are great but monday wednesday friday are also great you're like i'm able to admit that some days are rougher than others i love that i'm always on bro okay what advice would you give to people who are not always on hobbyists how to get better like people that are already there i don't know purple bells brown bells black bells they're just like doing like a couple times a week or something like that like how to get better i think being consistent like find a schedule that you can consistently train maybe it's like you know three four times a week or even a little bit less just be consistent over the over the years i mean too too often people are like oh i wanna get really good really fast and it's like definitely takes a long time to get to where you wanna be what about you know what you're doing during like do while while being consistent what kind of stuff you're working on so honestly i think one big thing for me which i something i actually started doing once once b team was formed was filming all of your rounds and then watching it every day because you can see what specific problems you're having and then you can base your positional rounds around those problems that's really interesting it's kinda depressing though yeah like sometimes i have to you know i i edited this podcast for a long time i still do in part and i hate the sound of my voice and like what i look like it's tough but it does make you better yeah and i also hate the sound of craig's voice that's what it looks like so this will be especially difficult this will be doubly difficult but i'm glad glad the rest of you are here i don't know that's that's a do you what do you watch competition footage of yourself or no like to analyze like oh you see my confidence that's fucking good while you're doing curls yeah i'm trying not to watch it to lose my confidence is there advice you kergie would give for hobbyists to get better i mean just not every round has to be a fight to the death you know i feel like you're gonna get injured burnt out that way and you're not gonna learn as much it's tough i would say just as a black belt who took just very seriously for a very long time basically when you become a hobbyist your skill is basically slipping your age and your skill and so not taking stuff seriously is actually its own psychological skill of like you that it's tough it's tough like it it's it's tough in a way that is different when you're like a blue belt or something that you're if you work hard and you train correctly you're gonna get much better here you're kinda you're looking downhill you're freaking downhill and you're like yeah i guess i'm gonna enjoy the art of it reframe the victory you know like if it's a young upcoming guy and he comes to meet you you're like woah that's a that's a moral victory you know yeah but then that that that has to happen you have to be able to not do that to avoid injury sometimes like if you want so yeah it's a different it's a different thing plus plus with me just because some people recognize me they they come in you have that probably you guys definitely obviously have that i've solved that problem wait what's your how did you solve that problem traveling around you do a seminar anything like that yeah it's believable that you could get submitted once yeah but if they catch you give them a few yeah if people tell their friends they submitted me to seminar yeah one time believable yeah they got me four five times four times yeah you've robbed them of that okay that that's pretty funny but it's also they have this energy like they think you know they're coming in hot and i i i usually like to just basically get submitted quickly twice and just it changes everything it makes it more fun i see i've i've noticed let them submit you twice yeah just like very quickly what you like what are the options for us we're not enough they can last longer hold off but then it's like it's very hard to like yeah if you're a very serious competitor and someone you take it seriously then yes but like then people go people what they try to do this probably is what happens to you guys they try to impress you by going super hard i i have people every day come to my gym try to take me out yeah yeah gotta see you gotta i just stay sharp come to practice let's get it on do you do you feel that energy i feel like i need to talk to craig here first it's like a like a seminar like somebody is coming in like really hard like a brown belt will come in like and they really wanna impress you with like their technical side they're a big fan they've been watching your dvds like what do you do with a guy like that i make a complete joke out of the role you know give them the pass mess with them do stupid shit you know like rub them of the realness of it because it's stupid i'm not gonna roll hard with strangers you know i feel like you should roll with a circle of people you trust injuries happen rolling hard with strangers because that's the same way you get injured in competition because you don't have that relationship with them and i i should also mention that's probably not a good way to impress somebody's bug just going ape shit going a hundred percent oh yeah that's not not at all i think the the beauty of it is just is like the camaraderie of it like as you get to know each other it's like technical like different ideas you have and all that yeah okay do you think gijutsu is dying in popularity craig yeah it's long dead i i think it's just i mean it just shows like i mean i have heard some numbers on the viewership for the gee worlds finals and they don't even compare to the undercard of like who's number one events so i think like when i was coming up and competing in the gee all the time you looked at those guys that won blackbird championships and you were like in awe of them it almost had that adcc champion feel but now that's not the case you know i just feel like that the younger generation aren't looking at who's winning black belt key words i personally don't think and i don't think they're like they wanna be that guy they wanna be like a rotolo gordon you know those are the people they wanna emulate so you think like the gi like abhijf gi tournaments will just keep declining popularity oh i think people will still do it i mean it's easier i think as you're over thirty because the gi is a bit of a slower thing and the master's participation is bigger in the gi because obviously your no gi is now heading in a wrestling direction wrestling and hill hooks you're over thirty that's a terrifying prospect you know what's terrifying about the gi less so i think in a participation rate the rbg jeff will still be good but i just don't think people are as interested as they used to be why why is wrestling and heel hooks terrifying like heel hooks i can vaguely understand if you don't understand heel hooks you work a desk job and you've never wrestled and a guy double legs you that's gonna probably break your back you know i think the older guys are scared of wrestling it's hard to wrestle at forty to learn wrestling at forty is it yeah it's yeah i mean i think it's even just hard in general to do wrestling at forty but it's easy to pull pull half guard in the game at forty i think it's harder to do judo at forty and people still do it at forty judo hurts more i i judo's scarier than all of them yeah i think does wrestling really hurt in forty i i don't i don't know i don't know why i'm looking at you yeah it does interesting i mean i feel i agree with you saying that judo looks like the most dangerous like even their their practice partners they're just getting slammed flat mhmm bueno yeah i did i mean i did judo for a really long time there's a lot of people that are forty fifty sixty do judo and they get they're the ones that are still alive though it's true survivor bias you do a little bit of judo right yeah i'm a yellow belt you're a yellow belt in judo i should be an instructor promote you to orange i got a yellow belt in the sixth grade i believe it was the sixth grade i did it for about i don't know six months but you're also using judo in competition basically alright aren't you doing like harai type throw like you're doing martial arts i don't know where i wanted that i just started doing it you just started lifting your leg in various ways until it works just just figuring it out yeah okay doing different kinds of trips i looked at the samberg guys doing it i was like it can't be that hard yeah gave it a crack well they they looked at your foot locks and they said that can't be that hard they they said can't be that hard ban it from the tournaments alright what do you think is the best takedown in no gi jiu jitsu like what like if if people were trying to train for competition so on like where you see the trends heading i think the foot sweep is like catching a fire nowadays so a lot a lot of foot sweeps foot sweeps and arm drags i would say pretty pretty popular in our sport arm drag she's just got arm drag to okay arm drag either to get them like get to behind them or even just to cause reactions make them pull away and we can start reattacking are you talking about it in a context of what's the best takedown to score what's the safest takedown to mitigate the risk of guillotine submission or most effective in general yeah most effective combined combined yeah yeah i mean i mean i think about scoring i think any sort of body lock you know what i mean locking your hands around the body you've been able to put them to the floor that way i feel like that's most effective safest might even have arisen out of a leg attack leg entry upgrade to the body what about like foot sweeps like outside foot sweeps or like what what do we i would say yeah you know foot sweeps from outside foot sweeps or even like something like you're tossing an appointment by and you're sweeping the foot yeah those are all pretty safe see why is that scary i don't understand it's not scary at all i think it's the lifts that are scary the lifts yeah who's lifting people i'm like i feel like a good lift return no not you i mean in master like we're talking about older guys doing no gear some of those old bosses take it very serious they just start lifting trt worlds trt worlds they're coming they're coming on a press grab a lift alright just just for the gram okay what about submission what's your favorite submission and what do you think is the most effective submission except the buggy choke i would have to say the rear naked it's definitely the one that's hit the most in the the highest level of competition was that that was pretty interesting to see you escape all that and to put put it on that's the cool thing about ebi to see like the world class athletes i was surprised that it's possible to escape with you on his back gonna try some of the bee cream oh yeah bee cream as it helps what's in the what's the formula or is that a secret that is a proprietary blend for sure but that's what you use for greasing that's what you've used before allegedly does these other application outside of grappling or i mean i'm sure you can get creative alright thanks asking for a friend is that r and c for you as well reneked reneked choke i mean overall favorite for like solidifying a finish because like you could push you could put somebody to sleep right even if they they don't wanna attack put them to sleep but as far as like something i've been working on now that i'm i'm now starting to implement in competition yoko senkaku's side triangle is like it's a beautiful thing you have multiple options you have the triangle to finish if that fails you have the komori you could break the arm you could also just transfer and take it back so yoko tsukako i'm a big fan of and i can see it's progressing and better at it have you ever broken anyone's arm oh yeah i mean the first first few competitions because i was like you know pretty athletic grappler or athletic wrestler going against like local black belts and brown belts like my one of my first matches i broke somebody a kimura pretty much every time i've got a heel hook which is only twice i've broken an an opponent if i have a joint lock it it's probably gonna break like a lot of times it breaks before they tap yeah you seem like a really friendly fella how hard is it to break an arm or any break a joint well i don't think it's that hard i think like if you're talking like an about an armbar we have this position to where like people kinda holding on holding on and then it slips and their arm starts going sure and then it just just breaks before they even you know get a chance to tap i i love this sport my knee bite a guy and he didn't tap one time and it was actually it was surprising i had to put a lot of force into that i suppose arms shoulders and the ligaments in the knees and ankles but to fully this kid sambo kid fully let it go and he tapped it out i think the angle is like up here they're built different hopefully it can be reconstructed rebuilt yeah alright what about a straight foot lock you've ever do you guys do straight foot locks at all or no yeah i mean i'm learning them now we had some kid come come into practice one day and like look at it well all of us do for the straight full lock straight full lock just this little like polish kid not only did he full lock everyone but he told the entire world send out fucking emails call his friends and family yeah we we frankly put a hit out on him in practice and he just loved everybody yeah so it was interesting when you get like yeah people that specialize can surprise you that this could be effective stuff do you think there's other stuff that could be still discovered in jiu jitsu like what what areas do you think are ripe with techniques to discover like wrestling is really interesting now there's a lot of innovation happening in wrestling i think there'll be more innovation when we get people that are more adamant about standing up from bottom position i think if we get more of the community they're like alright i wanna get off the bottom i think be just stand up just stand up how jiu jitsu doesn't work how we actually changed the name how samba doesn't work if you just stand did you really yeah alright i changed it to jiu jitsu when i hired it and send it for free to the entirety of the soviet block and nikkyra do you think ego is useful for martial arts or does it get in the way okay i think you need to use it in both ways for sure have an ego like if you're if you're training competition oh yeah but also it can prevent you from learning and progressing if your ego is too high like you really have to shut the ego down when you're in the mode of learning and trying to you know develop skills because you're gonna put yourself in these bad positions you're gonna have issues with training partners that aren't necessarily you know up to up to your skill level but because you're in these bad positions you have to make these certain sacrifices and for sure ego can be a good or bad thing but if you're able to shut the ego off and learn then that'll have huge progression when it's time to put the ego on into use during competition when's the last time you put shut the ego off it's been a long time what about you craig do you do you i mean you you seem to be super easygoing is there like is the ego just not part of it oh for sure i just don't want anyone to know they've damaged my ego you know you have to suppress it deep down there's a child underneath all of it crying always for sure i think ego is good for a bit of perseverance you know like it'll help you stick it out against a a tough battle with a training partner for sure a bit of egos on the line plus the banter back and forth we're trying to like stir each other up a bit i talk to shit yeah i think that helps hone sharpen the ego a bit what about you did you try do you seem like a super humble guy is is there like a monster underneath oh so it's a total act it's an act it's who's in the basement i think ego's a a big motivator you know i think it's very good to have in the aspect that it like it'll drive you to help to to wanna be one of the best in the world but like nicky rod said you need to be able to turn it off in the training room and you know force yourself into bad positions where you may not be winning are there like you know don harris mentioned boris are there like grapplers like bore this is a question from reddit actually boris like characters anybody you've trained with in the past who doesn't compete but is just an absolute beast in training like people you've met they're just like well somebody that i think has a probably the best like submission grappling in in mma i think like gilbert burns is is a is a his submission grappling is very very good i trained with him early early on in my grappling career and i was really impressed by his ability to to move hold down opponents that are trying to stand up and as a whole you know he can he can get submissions and put people away have you when's the last time have you trained them recently or no no it's been a few years which is impressive ability to submit you're saying yeah like i mean you know you would see i'd see gilbert go against a few like pretty decent black belts in the room and and farewell and you know maybe he gets to their back puts a choke in and it's like gilbert's super high level grappler or submission grappling yeah but he's pretty widely recognized as a as a monster so i don't know that didn't really answer the question i just think you're not even listening anymore what was the question alright what do may i is there is there people like you've done all these seminars are there just especially in in the in the eastern bloc that you you see yeah if you went to kazakhstan is there killers out there that oh yeah there's tough guys out there obviously i i don't remember their names nor could i pronounce it if i did but definitely some tough guys out there obviously carrying skill sets over from from wrestling for sure not sambo but wrestling wrestling well yeah are there are there just people that surprise you that just don't compete that are really good are there have you met those i feel like it's less so today because there's so many so many more athletes in the sport but definitely when i was coming up back like in australia and stuff there were guys i'd train with that wouldn't compete and that would be like super tough rounds for me yeah and there's so many more avenues for competing in general so yeah what about you have you met some monsters yeah one guy i could think of in particular is jason rowe he's he trains up in long island i think right opened up his own gym out there vanguard yeah vanguard he used to compete but he would never be able to compete at the same level he would train at so now he's just focused on mainly you know opening up a gym and and teaching his students but he was a guy that was you know extremely good in the training room you know world class i still think to this day he's he's legitimately one of the best in the world but just doesn't compete anymore who wins in a fight a lion or a bear polar bear this is for you reddit no not a poll well yes that's a good question see you're all yeah the polar bear is pretty impressive no grizzly bear grizzly bear i think a grizzly bear wins well who what's the most threatening predator in australia well i mean it's a tricky question here because everyone's scared of the animals in australia but i mean you get bitten by a snake you get bitten by a spider gotcha that's not that bad bear america bear would just hold you down and eat you that's a much more terrifying prospect for me even sharks sharks gonna be quick no one sees the shark coming the shark's just gonna bite you in half speed will take a bite and chew a bear just holds you down and eats you so that's that's frightening for me australia is a bunch of just weird shit that can kill you did you see cocaine bear the movie that's coming out i saw the trailer it looks good yeah yeah so there's not every bear there's like black belts and there's black belts there's bears and there's bears so that i think that's what they often don't talk about everybody puts lions and bears in the same category i think there's just some weak bears a lion would kill a black bear i think not every black again i'm trying to tell you there's there's difference like grizzly and polar bear i'm betting on those yeah no i think grizzlies have the size but actually every video i've seen of grizzlies they tie out within like twenty seconds they get bored that's the guest thing yeah the guest that's a nicky ryan guest thing right that's all that's all i got the dream old and they try to just they try to just take a breather like there's these crazy fights between bears and they last like twenty seconds i heard this story about a a russian family that was attacked by a bear in russia and killed the dad and it took took so long to eat the daughter she made three phone calls to her mom while i was eating her and the first call of the mom thought she was pranking her that's crazy that's way scarier than what we thought give me a snake bite any day food yeah you know what let me let me change the question is like if you had to fight a bear or a lion how would you try to defeat it do you think you have a chance at all well i think i'd i'd attack a lion a little bit differently than i had to attack a bear what what would be the difference okay well i've seen this video where a lions are eating and and you have three like skinny guys walk up behind them and kinda scare the cat off of yeah off their food i think maybe i produce some props scare the line away right but if i have to fight it if i have to fight it straight on i mean the thing is that you can't even if you take the back like you can't like bite it or choke it the mane is too big to lock your hands around you know are you sure about that because i mean it's just hair yeah the mane is yeah i mean it's thin hair it's like it's like matted hair right i don't know so i think you think you can make a big chicken's back and draw a line maintain yeah yeah but but but getting there getting there i think i fake high go low alright make them think i'm going for the foot or something a little paw sweep and i take the bear what about a what about a bear i feel like they're easier that might be easier to take to hold back control yeah maybe bigger the thing is if they the bear falls on its back just kinda crush it so so big substantially bigger than a line right like a fool going forward also like terrifyingly like loud with their rewards and stuff yeah i think i think so first of all if i saw grizzly i'm like alright he's gonna attack me i try to yell a little bit louder than them maybe the the term a little bit like give him a yeah and then yeah for sure i try to get behind it i'd probably go like something weird maybe like pull the eyes out or something you know for sure i mean i'm going for the vital organs you know i'm play dead play dead and then we'll check it there's no there's no pride in that well pride even matters see the ego the same advice you gave you gotta put the ego aside with the bear even then even then would you how would you fight a a bear or a lion just play dead play dead yeah alright could you beat a kangaroo a kangaroo yeah kangaroo i'd beat the shit out of kangaroo can you say that yeah yeah yeah i'd i mean are we boxing gloves we just like how would a kangaroo attack a human try to kick him with the claws knock him down and then they choke him stand on that tail the kangaroos do they choke each other yeah they don't choke each other you don't believe me you're not your video they choke each other out i've seen this yet oh yeah is it really yeah yeah with which well they do this lock or what yeah they knock them and just grip like this and hold them back what's the grip what just that does like a little pause how are they gripping i promise you i'm not lying i'm pretty sure i've seen them they also do strange shit like if there's a predator around they'll wait in a pool of water and then if it comes to attack they drown it they're pretty smart okay speaking of which what's the most effective martial art for winning a street fight you talked about rule sets and streets i think you've talked about being a street have you ever been in a street fight yeah just one yeah nothing special nothing crazy hey yeah you don't talk about that time like for self defense purposes what will be a strategy on the street what's advice whoever wins the street fights whoever's willing to take it the furthest the fastest you know what i mean if you're thinking that you're gonna box and he's biting you poking your eyes that guy's gonna win he wants it more you know what i mean that's why the crackheads fight they go for the kill straight away you know so i feel like it's more about who's willing to do the most that's gonna win that fight fastest the most fastest who's got the least to lose you know k we could also define winning differently because you could also run away but in terms of technique wise wrestling judo i think if it's a one on one i'd go i'd go wrestle wrestler wins but if it's like a you know it's like a multiple people you gotta go muay thai stay on their feet can't go down to the ground if it's more more than one person yeah big double leg maybe yeah double leg put them on sleep on the on the impact right forehead to the ground yeah what's the goal here is to win the fight and not go to prison i haven't thought of it through that way yeah certainly yeah yeah not go not not to not to kill we got mutual combat here in texas we're good is that in texas mhmm do you know what the paperwork for that looks like you have to actually sign something can you just say oh i don't need to find out i i did hear a story where guys were on sixth street and they looked at a cop they were like mutual combat mutual combat yeah and just got like the the cops to say yes and just duked it out they could be false though that sounds crazy i'm saying i i kinda admire that but i've also been playing red dead redemption recently so mhmm i've like internalized the cowboy a little a little too much it's just a return to gym stuff no because it's a business because you're running a business there's money involved but you're also friends but you're also training partners is there a tension that money creates that can threaten to destroy friendships that's something i always worry about with money i try not to go do any kind of business with friends or family i think if you're all very clear and honest and open at the start makes it much easier i think people have issues when there's like kind of like things are written or fine print and nobody knows exact answers and a lot of jujitsu guys can't read yeah that makes it makes it we're learning that today yeah hey no definitely complicated though yeah i mean it's it's not always obvious to how to be transparent and stuff and about everything have you felt that tension because in just a world money is not really unlimited just running a school what's that like because it's the first time you're running a school running a gym yeah i mean it's just constantly updating people about what's going on what your expectations are you know what i mean we've had some problems with coaches who i feel like think the pie is bigger than it is yeah you know what i mean they feel like maybe we're getting rich out of this and they're missing out on things so it's like even amongst managing staff that can be challenging too so yeah i mean it's a constant work in progress to make not only to make sure everyone's happy but to make sure they're comfortable enough to reach out and tell you they're unhappy but i feel like those challenges are common amongst any small business still it sucks just to mention i'm i'm clueless to this but i'm just not learning this somebody i met and talked to and i really like is isaac and i just learned because you're also active on reddit what's your name on reddit is this john belushi's mom as undercover as possible you know oh it's not you it's actually john belushi's mom right so i've done my research i guess and i guess you guys had a falling out and have split i just wanna say that i don't know the few interactions i've had with him he's a beautiful human being so and that just shows to me visually maybe not internally and then sexually just just the experience i don't know she's she's just a kind person i don't know i i liked him a lot like to me in a business setting yeah tensions are created and it sucks i don't know i mean i i i suppose money all the stuff that happened in the jungle aside probably money had a role to play to create extra tension money and egos about like who is the leader who is not the leader it's tough it's tough to manage that kind of stuff i've seen it happen with jiu jitsu schools a lot i don't know exactly what because it's like there is also a hierarchy inside grappling jiu jitsu schools like people that are better or not there's literally ranks black belt and brown belt there's like competitors that are better i mean i don't it's a weird dynamic in which to operate because like usually there's more politeness and like humanity layered into the way a company works but here there's just a bunch of i mean it's like violence laid on on display plus money it's crazy is there something you could say to that like how you try to minimize or something you wanna comment on isaac yeah i mean it was unfortunate situation but it just didn't work out you know like there's gonna be personality clashes some people i can't imagine anyone having a personality clash with you with me yeah it's hard to imagine yeah surprising chuck you know i mean i i didn't even know what to say on that i don't wanna touch on it too much but obviously his expectations about his role in the gym obviously different from ours led to some personality clashes that was sort of unresolved well you know some things happen that can't be resolved you can't fix those things yeah you know obviously a lesson i hope for both of us definitely a lesson for me from a management role to try to address these things sooner but also sometimes i came up in a different time where there was no money no opportunities i had to pave that i had to pave that way totally for myself especially coming from australia like being a professional athlete in jujutsu was not i think so i had to pave a lot of opportunities for myself and i feel like sometimes i don't know what the right word is sometimes people don't appreciate some of the ways you help them and they just think feel like almost they deserve or are entitled to certain things and that is very difficult to manage but i think again like we we both see the situation different i do hope he finds a better a more comfortable place to train but yeah obviously i've known him for a long time sorta like a a brotherly relationship so that's gonna really make personal problems a lot worse when you're that close to someone you know i just hated that like i've seen in jiu jitsu especially but in other places where like close friendships were destroyed because of like gym stuff like people running gyms and it just as a person who is in this case just a fan but in like in general just like a student it's like sucks but again in my position sometimes i wonder if there really was a friendship or mere opportunity i have to be careful of that with some people in the sport it's not yeah is it a sincere relationship or like i mean it's difficult for me to tell or am i means to an end sure but i think it's actually a trade off because i think a lot of close friendships we have like even relationships we have like when tested like can break if they're not properly communicated like some of it could be just misunderstanding of like for a prolonged period of time not not it's not explained through just like a lack of integrity it's just like you like you have to like talk through that shit like just be honest with each other take some mdma and we're gonna get down to it drugs solve everything you've already eaten from this conversation i've actually haven't done mdma yet people say that that's something i would enjoy a lot because my brain is i think natural on mdma i'd recommend it for sure for sure alright is that what you do with gabby and melton okay never mind she jogged me in general why is there seem always seems to be drama in the jiu jitsu world like outside of outside of what's going on here or is that just i think it's universal to anything drama's everywhere and then drama rises to the surface drama makes the money yeah i wish there was a little bit less you've you have a bunch of like we mentioned some of them you have a bunch of instructionals out what are some interesting things that you're looking forward to like exploring in terms of teaching so just stand up is your most recent one right yeah you also have one called power bottom an inclusive modern approach to the guard yep yep i was gonna say your tie what what are some other what are some other ones false reap allegations false reap allegations yeah by the way people talk about powerbot again hilarious title but they say it's a really good instructional unlike the guard yeah i try to i try to at least be innovative you know like everyone else i feel like is ripping off john and gordon putting some sort of slant so that's why i'm trying to take sort of a different approach i think you can actively influence the sport with what you release because people are gonna try to emulate that so i think that's those type of instructions just stand up power bottom like approaching the sport differently i think definitely has a positive impact on the how people play the game yeah are you working on something now probably a fundamentals course just because we're bringing out we did the white belt program coming in so i'm trying to develop a fundamentals course along the line of the constraint based learning stuff we were talking about today like a way to approach learning as a beginner to sort of speed up the process a bit and not make it as so technique dense at least have it a bit more fun and focusing in on just like examples of problems to solve exactly yeah approaching jiu jitsu learning that way like i mean kids learn quickly through games i think adults are capable of that to a certain extent as well you're releasing that instructional on pre match preparation yes what what other stuff do you have a thing on a body body lock pass yeah i have a i have a body lock or body lock dvd or instructional yeah i have the pre match ritual coming out i also have i'm filming how to build athleticism for grappling just really trying to capture different angles kind of like the same you know with craig's doing try try not to do the same thing that everybody else does you know there's a ton of wrestling ton of jiu jitsu instructional so and the steroid results are coming in oh yeah yeah more plates more dates you know derek that runs that hit me up for a blood panel test like an impromptu and i did it a few days ago
