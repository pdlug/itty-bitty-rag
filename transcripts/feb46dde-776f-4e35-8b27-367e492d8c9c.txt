the following is a conversation with sam harris his second time in the podcast as i said two years ago when i first met and spoke with sam he's one of the most influential pioneering thinkers of our time as the host of the making sense podcast creator of the waking up app and the author of many seminal books on human nature and the human mind including the end of faith the moral landscape lying free will and waking up in this conversation besides our mutual fascination with agi and free will we do also go deep into controversial challenging topics of donald trump hunter biden january sixth vaccines lab leak kanye west and several key figures at the center of public discourse including joe rogan and elon musk both of whom have been friends of sam and have become friends of mine somehow in an amazing life trajectory that i do not deserve in any way and in fact believe is probably a figment of my imagination and if it's alright please allow me to say a few words about this personal aspect of the conversation of discussing joe elon and others what's been weighing heavy on my heart since the beginning of the pandemic now three years ago is that many people i look to for wisdom in public discourse stop talking to each other as often with respect humility and love when the world needed those kinds of conversations the most my hope is that they start talking again they start being friends again they start noticing the humanity that connects them that is much deeper than the disagreements that divide them so let me take this moment to say with humility and honesty why i look up to and am inspired by joe elon and sam i think joe rogan is important to the world as a voice of compassionate curiosity and open mindedness to ideas both radical and mainstream sometimes with humor sometimes with brutal honesty always pushing for more kindness in the world i think elon musk is important to the world as an engineer leader entrepreneur and human being who takes on the hardest problems that face humanity and refuses to accept the constraints of conventional thinking that made the solutions to these problems seem impossible i think sam harris is important to the world as a fearless voice who fights for the pursuit of truth against growing forces of echo chambers and audience capture taking unpopular perspectives and defending them with rigor and resilience i both celebrate and criticize all three privately and they criticize me usually more effectively for which i always learn a lot and always appreciate most importantly there is respect and love for each other as human beings the very thing that i think the world needs most now in a time of division and chaos i will continue to try to mend divisions to try to understand not to ride to turn the other cheek if needed to return hate with love sometimes people criticize me for being naive cheesy simplistic all that i know i agree but i really am speaking from the heart and i'm trying this world is too fucking beautiful not to try in whatever way i know how i love you all and now a quick few second mention of each sponsor check them out in the description it's the best way to support this

support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's sam harris what is more effective at making a net positive impact on the world empathy or reason it depends on what you mean by empathy there there are two at least two kinds of empathy there's the the cognitive form which is you know i would argue even a species of of reason it's it's just understanding another person's point of view you know you understand why they're suffering or why they're happy or what you know we we just you have a theory of mind about another human being that is is accurate and so you can you can navigate in relationship to them more effectively and then there's an another layer entirely not incompatible with that but just distinct which is what people often mean by empathy which is more a kind of emotional contagion right like you feel depressed and i begin to feel depressed along with you because you know it's just it's contagious right i i i you know we're so close and i'm so i'm so concerned about you and your problems become my problems and it bleeds through right now i think both of those capacities are very important but the emotional contagion piece and this is not really my thesis this is something i i have more or less learned from from paul bloom the psychologist who wrote a book on this topic titled against empathy the emotional social contagion piece is a bad guide rather often for ethical behavior and ethical intuitions oh boy and i would go so i'll give you the the the clear example of this which is we find stories with a single identifiable protagonist who we can effortlessly empathize with far more compelling than data right so if i tell you you know this is the the classic case of of the little girl who who falls down a well right you know this is some somebody's daughter you see the parents distraught on television you hear her cries from the bottom of the well the whole country stops i mean this there was an example of this you know twenty twenty five years ago i think where it was just wall to wall on cnn this is just the perfect use of cnn it was you know seventy two hours or whatever it was of continuous coverage of just extracting this girl from a well so we effortlessly pay attention to that we care about it we will donate money toward it i mean it's just it marshals a hundred percent of our compassion and altruistic impulse whereas if you hear that there's a genocide raging in some country you've never been to and never intend to go to the numbers don't make a dent and the and we we find the story boring right and we'll change the channel in the face of a genocide right it doesn't matter so the and it literally perversely it could be five hundred thousand little girls have fallen down wells in that country and we still don't care right so it's you know many of us have come to believe that this is a bug rather than a feature of our moral psychology and so empathy plays an unhelpful role there so ultimately i think when we're making big decisions about what we should do and how to mitigate human suffering and what's worth valuing and how we should protect those values i think reason is the better tool but it's not that i would wanna dispense with any part of empathy either well there's a lot of tangent to go on there but briefly to mention you've recently talked about effective altruism on your podcast i think you mentioned some interesting statement i'm going to horribly misquote you but that you'd rather live in a world like it doesn't really make sense but you'd rather live in a world where you care about maybe your daughter and son more than a hundred people that live across the world something like this yeah like where the calculus is not always perfect but somehow it makes sense to live in a world where it's irrational in this way and yet empathetic in the way you've been discussing right i'm not sure what the right answer is there or or even whether there is one right answer there could be multiple you know peaks on on this part of the moral landscape but so the the opposition is between an ethic that's articulated by you know someone like the dalai lama right you know or really any exponent of of classic buddhism would say that the ultimate enlightened ethic is true dispassion with respect to friends and strangers right so that you would the mind of the buddha would be truly dispassionate you would love and care about all people equally and by that light it seems some kind of ethical failing or at least you know failure of of to fully actualize compassion in the limit or you know enlightened wisdom in the limit to care more or even and much more about your kids than the kids of other people or and to prioritize your your energy in that way right so you spend all this time trying to figure out how to keep your kids healthy and happy and you'll attend to their minutest concerns and however superficial and and again there's a genocide raging in sudan or or wherever and it it takes up less than one percent of your bandwidth i'm not sure it would be a better world if everyone was running the the dalai lama program there i think some prioritization of of one's nearest and dearest ethically might be optimal because we we'll all be doing that and we'll all be doing that in a circumstance where we have certain norms and and laws and and other structures that force us to be dispassionate where that matters right so like when i go to when my daughter gets sick and i have to take her to to a hospital you know i really want her to get attention right and i'm worried about her more than i'm worried about everyone else in the lobby but the truth is i actually don't want a totally corrupt hospital i don't want a hospital that treats my daughter better than anyone else in the lobby because she's my daughter and i have you know bribed the guy at the door or whatever you know or the guy's a fan of my podcast or whatever the thing is you don't want starkly corrupt unfair situations and when you sort of get pressed down the hierarchy of maslow's needs you know individually and societally a bunch of the a bunch of those variables change and they change for the worse understandably but yeah when things are when everyone's corrupt and it's you're you're in a in a state of of collective emergency you know you've got a lifeboat problem you're scrambling to get into the lifeboat yeah then then fairness and norms and and the you know the the other vestiges of civilization begin to get stripped off we can't reason from those emergencies to normal life i mean in normal life we want justice we want fairness we want we're all better off for it even when the spotlight of our concern is focused on the people we know the people who are friends the people who are family people we have good reason to care about we still by default want a system that protects the the interests of strangers too and and we know that generally speaking in just in in game theoretic terms we're all gonna tend to be better off in a fair system than a corrupt one one of the failure modes of empathy is our susceptibility to anecdotal data just a good story yeah will get us to not think clearly but what about empathy in the context of just discussing ideas with other people and then there's a large number of people like in this country you know red and blue half the population believes certain things on immigration or on the response to the pandemic or any kind of controversial issue even if if the election was fairly executed having an empathy for their worldview trying to understand where they're coming from not just in the explicit statement of their idea but the entirety of like the roots from which their idea stems that kind of empathy at while you're discussing ideas what is in your pursuit of truth having empathy for the perspective of a large number of other people versus raw mathematical reason i think it's important but i just it only takes you so far right it doesn't it doesn't get you to truth right it's not the truth is not a is not decided by democratic principles and certain people believe things for understandable reasons but those reasons are nonetheless bad reasons right they don't scale they don't generalize they're not reasons anyone should adopt for themselves or respect you know epistemologically and yet their circumstance is understandable and it's something you can care about right and so yeah like let me just take i think there's many examples of this that you might be thinking of but i mean one one that comes to mind is i've i've been super critical of trump obviously and i've been super critical of certain people for endorsing him or not criticizing him when he really made it you know patently obvious who he was you know if if there had been any doubt initially there was no doubt when we have a sitting president who's not not agreeing to a a peaceful transfer of power right so i'm i'm critical of all of that and yet the fact that many millions of americans didn't see what was wrong with trump or bought into the didn't see through his con right i mean they bought into the idea that he was a brilliant businessman who might just be able to change things because he's so unconventional and so you know his heart is in the right place he's really a man of the people even though he's a gold plated everything in his life they bought the myth somehow of you know largely because they had seen him on television for almost a decade and a half pretending to be this genius businessman who could get things done it's understandable to me that many very frustrated people who have not had their hopes and dreams actualized who have been the victims of globalism and and many other you know current trends it's understandable that they would be confused and and and not see the liability of electing a grossly incompetent morbidly narcissistic person into the into the presidency so i don't so which is to say that i don't blame there are many many millions of people who i don't necessarily blame for the trump phenomenon but i can nonetheless bemoan the phenomenon as as indicative of you know very bad state of affairs in our society right so it's it's there's two levels to it i mean one is i think you have to call a spade a spade when you're talking about how things actually work and what things are are likely to happen or not but then you can recognize that people have very different life experiences and yeah i mean i think empathy and you know probably the better word for what i would hope to embody there is compassion right like really you know to really wish people well you know and to really wish strangers well effortlessly wish them well i mean to realize that there is no opposition between at bottom there's no real opposition between selfishness and selflessness because wise selfishness really takes into account other people's happiness i mean which do you do you wanna live in a society where you have everything but most other people have nothing or do you wanna live in a society where you're surrounded by happy creative self actualized people who are having their hopes and dreams realized i think it's obvious that the second society is much better however much you can guard your good luck but what about having empathy for certain principles that people believe for example the the pushback the other perspective on this because you said bought the myth of trump as a great businessman there could be a lot of people that are supporters of trump who could say that sam harris bought the myth that we have this government of the people by the people that actually represents the people as opposed to a bunch of elites who are running a giant bureaucracy that is corrupt that is feeding themselves and they're actually not representing the people and then here's this chaos agent trump who speaks off the top of his head yeah he's flawed in all this number of ways he's a more comedian than he is a presidential type of figure and he's actually creating the kind of chaos that's going to shake up this bureaucracy shake up the elites that are so uncomfortable because they don't want the world to know about the game they got running on everybody else so that's you you know yeah yeah that's a kind of perspective that they would take and say yeah yeah there's these flaws that trump has but this is necessary i agree with the first part so i i haven't bought the myth that it's you know a truly representative democracy in in the way that we would you might idealize and you know on some level i mean this is a different conversation but on some level i'm not even sure how much i think it should be right like i i'm not sure we want in the end everyone's opinion given equal weight about you know just what we should do about anything and i include myself in that i mean there are many topics around which i don't deserve to have a strong opinion because i don't know what i'm talking about right or what i would be talking about if i had a strong opinion so and i think we'll probably get to that to some of those topics because i've declined to have certain conversations on my podcast just because i think i'm the wrong person to have that conversation right and and it's and i think it's important to see those bright lines in in one's life and in in the moment politically and ethically so yeah i think so leave aside the the the viability of democracy i'm i'm under no illusions that all of our institutions are you know worth preserving precisely as they have been up until the moment this great orange wrecking ball came swinging through our lives but i just it was a very bad bet to elect someone who is grossly incompetent and worse than incompetent genuinely malevolent in his selfishness right i think and this is something we know based on literally decades of him being in the public eye right he's not as he's not a public servant in any normal sense of that term and he couldn't possibly give an honest or sane answer to the question the question you asked me about empathy and reason and and like how should we you know what should guide us i genuinely think he is missing some necessary moral and and psychological tools right and this this is i can feel compassion for him as a human being because i think having those things is incredibly important and genuinely loving other people is incredibly important and knowing what all that's about is is is that's really the good stuff in life and i i i think he's missing a lot of that but i think we we don't wanna promote people to to the highest positions of power in our society who are far outliers in in pathological terms right we want them to be far outliers in in if if in the best case in wisdom and compassion and some of the things you've some of the topics you brought up i mean we want someone to be deeply informed we want someone to be unusually curious unusually alert to how they may be wrong or getting things wrong consequentially he's none of those things and in so far as we're gonna get normal mediocrities in that role which i think you know is often the best we could expect let's get normal mediocrities in that role not you know once in a generation narcissists and frauds i mean it is like the we just take honesty as a single variable right i i think you want yeah yes it's possible that most politicians lie at least some of the time i don't think that's a good thing i think people should be gen you know generally honest even to a fault yes there are certain circumstances where lying i think is necessary it's it's kind of on a continuum of self defense and and violence so it's like if you're gonna you know if the nazis come to your door and ask you if you've got anne frank in the attic i think it's okay to lie to them but you know trump there's i i arguably there's never been a person in that anyone could name in in human history who's lied with with that kind of velocity i mean it's just it was he was a just a blizzard of lies great and small you know to to pointless and and to and effective but it's just it it says something fairly alarming about our society that a person of that character got promoted and so yes i have compassion and concern for for half of the society who didn't see it that way and that's gonna sound elitist and and and smug or something for anyone who's who's on that side listening to me but it's genuine i mean i'm i understand that like like i barely have the i'm like one of the luckiest people in the world and i barely have the bandwidth to pay attention to half the things i should pay attention to in order to have an opinion about half the things we're gonna talk about right so how much less bandwidth is somebody who's working two jobs or you know a single mom who's who's you know raising you know multiple kids you know even a single kid it's just it's unimaginable to me that people have the the bandwidth to to really track this stuff and so then they jump on social media and they they see they get inundated by misinformation and they see what their favorite influencer just said and now they're worried about vaccines and they're it's just it's we're living in an environment where our our the information space has become so corrupted and we've built machines to to further corrupt it you know i mean we've built a business model for the internet that further corrupts it so it's it is just it's chaos in informational terms and i don't fault people for being confused and impatient and at the at their wits end and yes trump was a an enormous fuck you to the establishment and that and that's that was understandable for many reasons to me sam harris the great sam harris is somebody i've looked up to for a long time as a beacon of voice of reason and there's this meme on the internet and i would love you to steel man the case for it and against that trump broke sam harris's brain that there's something it's disproportionately to the actual impact that trump had on our society he had an impact on the on the ability of balanced calm rational minds to see the world clearly to think clearly you being one of the beacons of that is there is there a degree to which you broke your brain otherwise known as trump derangement syndrome yeah yeah yeah medical well sorry medical competition yeah i mean i think trump derangement syndrome is a is a very clever meme because it it just throws the you know the the problem back on the person who's criticizing trump but sure in truth the the true trump derangement syndrome was not to have seen how dangerous and divisive it would be to promote someone like trump to that position of power and to not and in the in the the final moment not to see how untenable it was to still support someone who you know a sitting president who was not committing to a peaceful transfer of power i mean that was if if if that wasn't a bright line for you you have been deranged by something because that was you know the that was one minute to midnight for our democracy as as far as i i'm concerned and i think it really was but for the the integrity of a few people that we didn't suffer some real constitutional crisis and and real emergency you know after january sixth i mean if if mike pence had caved in and decided to not certify the election right if it literally you can count on two hands a number of people who held things together at that moment and so it wasn't for want of trying on trump's part that we we didn't succumb to some you know real truly uncharted catastrophe with our democracy so the fact that that didn't happen is not a sign that those of us who were worried that it was so close to happening were exaggerating the problem i mean it's like you know you almost got run over by a car but you didn't and so you know you're the fact that you're adrenalized and you're thinking you know oh boy that was dangerous i probably shouldn't you know you know wander in the middle of the street with my eyes closed you weren't wrong to feel that you really had a problem right and came very close to something truly terrible so i i think that's where we were and i think we shouldn't do that again right so the fact that he's he's still he's coming back around as potentially a viable candidate you know i'm not spending much time thinking about it frankly because it's you know i'm i'm waiting for the moment where it it it requires some thought i mean they it did it took up i don't know how many podcasts i devoted to the topic it wasn't that i mean it wasn't that many in the end you know against the the number of podcasts i i devoted to other topics but there are people who look at trump and just find him funny entertaining not especially threatening he's like not a you know it just it's just good fun to see somebody who's like who's just not taking anything seriously and is just just putting a you know a stick in the wheel of of business as usual again and again and again and again and they don't really see anything much at stake right it doesn't really matter if we don't support nato doesn't really matter if he says he trusts putin more than our intelligence services i mean none of this is it doesn't matter if he's on the one hand saying that he loves the leader of north korea and on the other threatening threatens to to you know bomb them back to the stone age right on twitter it's all it all can be taken in the spirit of kind of reality television it's like this is just this is the part of the movie that's just fun to watch right and i understand that i can even inhabit that space for a few minutes at a time but there's a deeper concern that we're in the process of entertaining ourselves to death right that we're just not taking things seriously and this is this is a problem i've had with several other people we might name who just who just appear to me to be goofing around at scale and they lack a kind of moral seriousness i mean they're they're touching big problems where lives hang in the balance but they're just fucking around and i think they're really important problems that we have to get our head straight around and we need you know it's not to say that that institutions don't become corrupt i i think they do and i think and i'm quite worried that you know both about the the the loss of trust in our institutions and the the fact that trust has eroded for good reason right that they have become less trustworthy i i i think you know they've become infected by you know political ideologies that are not truth tracking i mean i i worry about all of that but i just think we need institutions we need to rebuild them we need experts who are real experts we need to value expertise over you know amateurish speculation and conspiracy thinking and just you know bullshit the kind of amateur speculation we're doing on this very podcast i'm usually alert to the moments where i'm just guessing or where i actually feel like i'm talking from within my wheelhouse and i try to telegraph that a fair amount with people so yeah i mean it but it's it's not it's different like i mean you you can invite someone onto your podcast who's an expert about something that you're you're you're not an expert about and then you you in the process of getting more informed yourself your your audience is getting more informed so you're asking smart questions and you might be pushing back at the margins but you know that when push comes to shove on that topic you really don't have a basis to have a a strong opinion and if you were gonna form a a a a strong opinion that was this counter to the expert you have in front of you it's gonna be by deference to some other expert who you've brought in or who you've heard about or whose work you've you've read or whatever but there there's a paradox to how we value authority in science that most people don't understand and i think we should at some point unravel that because it's it's the basis for a lot of public confusion and and for frankly it's the basis for a lot of criticism i've received on these topics where people think that i'm against free speech or i'm an establishment shill or it's it's like i just think i'm a credentialist i just think people with phds from ivy league university should you know run everything it's not true but there's a ton of there's there's a lot to cut through to get to daylight there because people are very confused about how we value authority in the service of rationality generally you've talked about it but it's it's just interesting the intensity of feeling you have you've you've had this famous phrase about hunter biden and children in the basement can you just revisit this case so let me let me give another perspective on the situation of january sixth and trump in general it's possible that january sixth and things of that nature revealed that our democracy is actually pretty fragile and then trump is not a malevolent and ultra competent malevolent figure but is simply a jokester and he just by creating the chaos revealed that it's all pretty fragile because you're a student in history and there's a lot of people like vladimir lenin hitler who are exceptionally competent at controlling power at being executives and taking that power controlling the generals controlling all the figures involved and certainly not tweeting but working in the shadows behind the scenes to gain power and they did so extremely competently and that is how they were able to gain power the the pushback with trump is he was doing none of that he was creating he's very good at creating drama sometimes for humor's sake sometimes for drama's sake and simply reveal that our democracy is fragile and so he's not this once in a generation horrible figure once in a generation narcissist no i i i don't think he's he's a a truly scary sinister you know putin like or you know hitler much less hitler like figure not at all i mean he's not ideological he doesn't care about anything beyond himself so it's not no no he's much less scary than any really scary you know totalitarian right i mean and he's he's more brave in new world than nineteen eighty four this is what you know eric weinstein never stops badgering me about but you know he's still wrong eric you know i i can you know my my analogy for trump was that he's evil chauncey gardener i don't know if you remember the the the the the book or the film being there with with peter sellers but you know peter sellers is this gardener who really doesn't know anything but he gets recognized as this wise man and he gets promoted to immense power in in washington because he's speaking in these kind of in a in a semblance of wisdom he's got these very simple aphorisms or what seemed to be aphorisms he's just talking all he cares about is gardening he's just talking about his garden all the time yeah but you know he'll say something but yeah you know in the spring you know the new shoots will will bloom and people read into that some kind of genius you know insight politically and so he gets promoted and so that's the that's the joke of the film for me trump has always been someone like an evil chauncey gardiner he's he's it's not to say he's totally yes he has a certain kind of genius he's got a genius for creating a spectacle around himself right he's got a genius for getting the the eye of the media always coming back to him but it it it's only it's a kind of it's a kind of you know self promotion that only works if you actually are truly shameless and don't care about having a reputation for anything that that that i or you would wanna have a reputation for right it's like it's pure the pure pornography of attention right he and he just wants more of it i think the truly depressing and genuinely scary thing was that we have a country that at least half of the country given how broken our society is in many ways we have a country that didn't see anything wrong with that bringing someone who's who obviously doesn't know what he should know to be president and who's obviously not a good person right obviously doesn't care about people can't even pretend to care about people really right in a credible way and so i mean this if there's a silver lining to this it it's it's along the lines you just sketched it shows us how vulnerable our system is to a truly brilliant and sinister figure right i mean like i i think we are we really dodged a bullet yes someone far more competent and conniving and ideological could have exploited our system in a way that trump didn't and i and that's yeah so if if we plug those holes eventually that would be a good thing and he would have done a good thing for our society right i mean one of the things we realized and i i think nobody knew i mean i certainly didn't know it and i didn't hear anyone talk about it is how much our system relies on norms rather than laws yeah civility right yeah it's just like it's it's quite possible that he never did anything illegal you know true truly illegal i mean i think he probably did a few illegal things but like illegal such that he really should be thrown in jail for it you know at least that remains to be seen so all of the chaos all of the you know all of the diminishment of our stature in the world all of the opportunity costs of spending years focused on nonsense all of that was just norm violations all of that was just that was just all a matter of not saying the thing you should say but that doesn't mean they're insignificant right it's not that it's like it's not illegal for a sitting president to say no i'm not gonna commit to a peaceful transfer of power right we'll wait and see whether i win if i win it it it it it's it was the election was was was valid if i lose it was fraudulent right but aren't those humorous perturbations to our system of civility such that we know what the limits are and now we start to think that and have these kinds of discussions but that that wasn't a humorous perturbation because he did everything he could granted he wasn't very competent but he did everything he could to try to steal the election i mean the irony is he claimed to have an election stolen from him all the while doing everything he could to steal it declaring it fraudulent in advance trying to get the votes to to to to not be counted as the evening wore on knowing that they were gonna be disproportionately democrat democrat votes because of the the you know because of the position he took on mail in ballots i mean all of it was fairly calculated the whole circus of of of you know the clown car that crashed into you know the four seasons landscaping right and and you got rudy giuliani with his hair dye and you got sydney powell and all the all these grossly incompetent people lying as freely as they could breathe about election fraud right and all of these things are getting thrown out by you know republican largely republican election officials and republican judges it wasn't wasn't for want of trying that he didn't maintain his power in this country he really tried to steal the presidency he just was not competent and the people around him weren't competent so that's a good thing and it's worth not letting that happen again but he wasn't competent so he didn't do everything he could well no he did everything he could he didn't do everything that could have been done by someone more competent right but the the tools you have as a president you could do a lot of things you can declare emergencies especially during covid you could postpone the election right you can create military conflict that you know any kind of reason to postpone the election there's there's a lot of ways to but he tried to do things and he would have to have done those things through other people and there are people who refuse to do those things there are people who said they would quit they would they would quit publicly right i mean this you you start again there are multiple books written about all in the the last hours of of this presidency and the details are shocking in what he tried to do and tried to get others to do and it's awful right i mean it's it's just awful that we were that close to something to to a true unraveling of our political process i mean it's the only time in our lifetime that anything like this has happened and it's deeply embarrassing right for you know on the world stage it's just like we we looked like a banana republic there for a while and we're the the lone superpower it's a it's it's not good and so we shouldn't i get there's no there's no the i the people who thought well we just need to shake things up and this is a great ins great way to shake things up and having people you know storm our capital and you know smear shit on the walls that's just more shaking things up right it's all just for the lulz there's a nihilism and cynicism to all of that which again in certain people it's understandable you know frankly it's not understandable if you've got a billion dollars and you're you you know have a compound in menlo park or wherever it's like there are people who are cheerleading this stuff who shouldn't be cheerleading this stuff and who know that they can get on their gulfstream and fly to their compound in new zealand if everything goes to shit right so there there's a cynicism to all of that that i think we should be deeply critical of what what i'm trying to understand is not and analyze is not the behavior of this particular human being but the effect it had in part on the division between people as to me the degree the meme of sam harris's brain being broken by trump represents you're like the person i would look to to bridge the division well i don't think there is something profitably to be said to someone who's truly captivated by the the the personality cult of trumpism right like there's nothing that i'm gonna say to there's no conversation i'm gonna have with candace owens say about trump that's gonna converge on something reasonable right you don't think so no i mean i've tried i haven't tried with candace but i've tried with you know many people who are in that particular orbit i mean i i've i've had conversations with people who won't admit that there's anything wrong with trump anything so i'd like to push for the empathy versus reason because when you operate in the space of reason yes but i think there's a lot of power in you showing in you sam harris showing that you're willing to see the good qualities of trump publicly showing that i think that's the way to win over the kennedy's so few of them he he has fewer good qualities than any virtually anyone i can name right so he he's funny he i'll i'll grant you that he's funny he's a he's a he's a good entertainer does others look at just policies and actual impacts he had i've i've admitted that no no so like so i've admitted that many of his policies i agree with many many of his i mean so probably more often than not i mean at least on balance i agreed that's why i agreed with his policy that you know we should take china seriously as an adversary right and i think i mean again you have to there's a lot of fine print to a lot of this because the way he talks about these things and and many of his motives that are obvious are are things that i don't support but i mean take immigration i think there's it's obvious that we should have control of our borders right like i i don't see the argument for not having control of our borders we should let in who we wanna let in and we should keep out who we wanna keep out and we should have a sane immigration policy so i don't i didn't necessarily think it was a priority to build the wall but i didn't i never criticize the impulse to build the wall because if you know tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people are coming across that border and we are not in a position to know who's coming that seems untenable to me so and i can recognize that many people in our society are on balance the victims of immigration and there is in many cases a zero sum contest between the interests of actual citizens and the interests of immigrants right so i think we should have a we should have control of our borders we should have a sane and compassionate immigration policy we should have we should let in refugees right so i did you know trump on refugees was terrible but no like i would say eighty percent of the policy concerns people celebrated in him are concerns that i either share entirely or certainly sympathize with right so like that's not that's not the issue the issue is a threat to democracy and some funny story the issue is largely what you said it was it it's not so much the person it's the effect on everything he touches right he just he has this this superpower of deranging and destabilizing almost everything he touches and sullying the and and compromising the integrity of almost anyone who comes into his orbit i mean so you looked at these people who served you know as chief of staff or you know in various cabinet positions people had real reputations you know for for probity and and level headedness you know whether you share their politics or not i mean these were real people these were not you know some of them were goofballs but you know many people who who just got totally trashed by proximity to him and then trashed by him when they finally parted company with him yeah i mean there's just people bent over backwards to accommodate his norm violations and it it was it was bad for them and it was bad for our our our system and but that but none of that discounts the fact that we have a system that really needs a proper house cleaning yes there are bad incentives and entrenched interests and yeah i'm not a fan of the concept of of the deep state but because it you know it's been so propagandized but yes there's there's something like that you know that is not flexible enough to to respond intelligently to the needs of the moment right so there's a lot of rethinking of government and of institutions in general that i think we should do but we need smart well informed well intentioned people to do that job and the well intentioned part is is hugely important right it's just give me someone who is not the most selfish person anyone has ever heard about in their lifetime right and what we got with trump was the like the literally the one most selfish person i think anyone could name i mean and you and again you there's so much known about this man that's the thing it was like it predates his presidency we knew this guy thirty years ago and this is why to come back to those inflammatory comments about hunter biden's laptop the reason why i can say with confidence that i don't care what was on his his laptop is that there is an and that includes any evidence of corruption on the on the part of his father right now there's been precious little of that that's actually emerged so it's like there is no as far as i can tell there's not a big story associated with that laptop as much as people bang on about a few emails but even if there were just obvious corruption right like joe biden was at this meeting and he took this amount of money from this shady guy for bad reasons given how visible the lives of these two men have been right i mean given how much we know about joe biden and how much we know about donald trump and how they have lived in public for almost as long as i've been alive both of them the the the the scale of corruption can't possibly balance out between the two of them right we i if if you show me that joe biden has this secret life where he's driving a bugatti and he's living like andrew tate right and he's do he's doing all these things i didn't know about okay then i'm gonna start getting a sense that alright maybe this guy is way more corrupt than i realized maybe there is some deal in ukraine or with china that is just like this guy is not who he seems he's not the public servant he's been pretending to be he's been on the take for decades and decades and he's just he's as dirty as can be he's all mobbed up and it's a nightmare and he can't be trusted right that's possible if you show me that his life is not at all what it seems but on the assumption that i having looked at this guy for literally decades right and and knowing that every journalist has looked at him for decades just how many affairs is he having just how much you know how many drugs is he doing how many houses does he have where you know what what what is what are the obvious conflicts of interest you know you hold that against what we know about trump right and i mean the litany of indiscretions you can put on trump's side that that testify to his personal corruption to testify to the fact that he has no ethical compass there's simply no comparison right so that's why i don't care about what's on the laptop when now if you tell me trump is no longer running for president in twenty twenty four and we can put trumpism behind us and now you're saying listen there's a lot of stuff on that laptop that makes joe biden look like a total asshole okay i'm all ears right i mean it it was a forced in twenty twenty it was a forced choice between a sitting president who wouldn't commit to a peaceful transfer of power and a guy who's obviously too old to be president who has a crack addicted son who who you know who lost his laptop and i just knew that i was gonna take biden in spite of whatever litany of horrors was gonna come tumbling out of that laptop and that might involve sort of so the actual quote is hunter biden literally could have had the corpses of children in the basement there there's dark humor to it right which is i think you speak to i would not have cared there's nothing it's hunter biden it's not joe biden whatever the scope of joe biden's corruption is it is infinitesimally compared to the corruption we know trump was involved in it's like a firefly to the sun is what you're speaking to but let me make the case that you're really focused on the surface stuff that it's possible to have corruption that masquerades in the thing we mentioned which is civility you can men you can spend hundreds of billions of dollars or trillions towards the war in the middle east for example something that you've changed your mind on in terms of the negative impact it has on the world and that you know the military industrial complex is everybody's very nice everybody's very civil there's very up front here's how we're spending the money yeah it sometimes somehow disappears in different places but that's the way you know war is complicated and it's everyone is very polite there's no coke and strippers or whatever is on the laptop it's very nice and polite in the meanwhile hundreds of thousands of civilians die hate it it just an incredible amount of hate is created because people lose their family members all that kind of stuff but there's no strippers and coke on on a laptop so but it yeah but it but it's not just superficial it is when you when someone only wants wealth and power and fame that's this is well that is their their objective function right they're like a a robot that is calibrated just to those variables right and they don't care about the risks we run on any other front they don't care about environmental risk pandemic risk nuclear proliferation risk none of it right they just they're just tracking fame and money and and whatever can can personally redound to their self interest along those lines and they're not informed about the other risk we're running really i mean in trump you you had a president who was repeatedly asking his generals why couldn't we use our nuclear weapons why can't we have more of them why do i have fewer nuclear weapons than jfk right as though that were a sign of of of anything other than progress right and this is the guy who's got the the the button right i mean he's got the somebody's following him around with a bag waiting to take his order to launch right that is a it's just it's a it's a a risk we should never run one thing trump has going for him i think is that he's he doesn't drink or do drugs right although you know there's you know people allege that he does speed but you know let's take him at his word he's he's not deranging himself with with pharmaceuticals at least but apart from diet coke but there's nothing wrong just for the record let me push back on that there's nothing wrong with diet coke yeah all i i assume we have very large amounts i occasionally have some myself there's no there's no scientific evidence that i observed the negatives of you know all those studies about aspartame and all that is no i don't know i'd like i i hope i hope you're right yeah i mean everything you said about the military industrial complex is true right and and it's been we've been worrying about that on both sides of the aisle for a very long time i mean that's just that phrase came from from eisenhower it's i mean so much of what ails us is a story of bad incentives right and bad incentives are so powerful that they corrupt even good people right how much more do they corrupt bad people right like so it's like you want it at minimum you want reasonably good people at least non pathological people in a in the system trying to navigate against the grain of bad incentives and better still all of us can get together and and try to diagnose those incentives and change them right and and and we will really succeed when we have a system of incentives where the the good incentives are so strong that even bad people are effortless behaving as though they're good people because they're so successfully incentivized to behave that way right that's and so so it's it's almost the inversion of our current situation so yes and you say i changed my mind about the war not quite i mean i i was never a supporter of the war in iraq i was always worried that it was a a distraction from the war in afghanistan i was a supporter of the war in afghanistan and i will admit in hindsight that looks like you know at best a highly ambiguous and painful exercise you know more likely a fool's errand right i was like that would you know it did not turn out well it's it wasn't for want of trying i i don't you know i i have not done a deep dive on on all of the failures there and maybe all of these failures are failures in principle i mean maybe it's just maybe that's not the kind of thing that can be done well by anybody whatever our intentions but yeah the the move to iraq always seemed questionable to me and when we knew the problem the immediate problem at that moment al qaeda was in afghanistan you you know and then bounce into pakistan anyway you know so yes but my my sense of the possibility of nation building my sense of of you know and so insofar as the the the neocon spirit of of you know responsibility and idealism that you know america was the kind of nation that should be functioning in this way as as the world's cop and we got we have to get in there and and untangle some of these knots by force rather often because you know if we don't do it over there we're gonna have to do it over here kind of thing yeah some of that has definitely changed for me in my thinking i mean there are obviously cultural reasons why it failed in afghanistan and and if you can't change the culture it's you're not gonna force a change at gunpoint in the culture it certainly seems that that's not gonna happen and it took us you know over twenty years to apparently to realize that that's one of the things you realize with the wars there's not going to be a strong signal that things are not working if you just keep pouring money into a thing a military effort well also there there are signs of it working too you have all the stories of girls now going to school right you know the girls are getting battery acid thrown in their faces by religious maniacs and then we come in there and we stop that and now girls are getting educated and there's a and that's all good and our intentions are good there and i mean we're on the right side of history there good girls should be going to school you know malala yousafzai should have the nobel prize and she shouldn't have been shot in the face by by the taliban right we know what the right answers are there the question is what do you do when there are enough in this particular case religious maniacs who are willing to die and let their children die in defense of crazy ideas and moral norms that belong in the seventh century and it's a problem we couldn't solve and we couldn't solve it even though we spent you know trillions of dollars to solve it this reminded me of the thing that you and and jack dorsey jokingly had for a while is the discussion about banning donald trump from twitter but does any of it bother you now that twitter files came out that it mean this has to do with sort of the hunter laptop hunter biden laptop story does it bother you that there could be a collection of people that make decisions about who to ban or not and that that could be susceptible to bias and to ideological influence well i i think it always will be or in the absence of perfect ai it always will be and this becomes relevant with ai as well yeah because there's some censorship on ai happening yeah and it's an interesting question there as well i don't think twitter is important as people think it is right and and i i used to think it was more important when i was on it and now that i'm off of it i think it's it's i mean first let me say it's just an unambiguously good thing in my experience to delete your twitter account right it's like it it is just even the good parts of twitter that i miss were bad in the aggregate in the the degree to which it was fragmenting my attention the degree to which my life was getting doled out to me in periods between those moments where i checked twitter right and had my attention diverted and and i was you know i was not a a a crazy twitter addict i mean i was a i i was probably a pretty normal user i mean i was not someone who was tweeting multiple times a day or even every day right i mean i would i probably i think i probably averaged something like one tweet a day i think i averaged but in reality it was like you know there'd be like four tweets one day and then i wouldn't tweet for the better part of a week and but i was looking a lot because it was my newsfeed i was just following you know two hundred very smart people and i would just wanted to see what they were paying attention to and they would recommend articles and i would read those articles and and then when i would read an article then i would that i would thought i should signal boost i would tweet and so all of that seemed good and you know like that's all separable from all of the odious bullshit that came back at me in in response to this largely in response to this hunter biden thing but even the good stuff has a downside and it comes at just this point of your phone is this perpetual stimulus of which is intrinsically fragmenting of time and attention and now my phone is is a much less of a presence in my life and it's it's not that i don't check slack or check email and you know i i use it to work but my sense of just what the world is and my sense of my place in the world the sense of where i exist as a person has changed a lot by deleting my twitter account i mean i had a and it's just it's and and the things that i think i i mean we all know this phenomenon we we we say of someone you know that person's too online right like what does it mean to be too online and where do you draw the that that boundary you know where how do you know what what constitutes being too online well in some sense just being i think being on on social media at all is to be too online given what it does to given the kinds of information it it signal boosts and given the given the impulse it kindles in each of us to reach out to our audience in at in specific moments and in specific ways right it's like there there are lots of moments now where i have an opinion about something but there's nothing for me to do with that opinion right like there's no twitter right so like there there are lots of things that i would have tweeted mhmm in the last months that are not the kind of thing i'm gonna do a podcast about i'm not gonna roll out ten minutes on that topic on my podcast i'm not gonna take the time to really think about it but had i been on twitter i would have reacted to this thing in the news or this thing that some somebody did right what do you do with that thought now i just let go of it like chocolate ice cream is the most delicious thing yeah it's it's usually not that sort of thing but it's it's just but then you look at the kinds of problems people create for themselves you look at the life deranging and reputation destroying things that people do and and i look at the things that that have you know the analogous things that have happened to me i mean the things that have really bent my life around professionally over the past you know decade so much of it is twitter i mean honestly in my case almost a hundred percent of it was twitter the the controversies i would get into the things i i would think i would have to respond to in a pod like i would release a podcast on a certain topic i would see some blowback on twitter you know it would give me the sense that there was some signal that i really had to respond to now that i'm off twitter i i recognize that most of that was just it was totally specious right it was it was not something i had to respond to but yet i would then do a cycle of podcast responding to that thing that like to taking my foot out of my mouth or taking someone else's foot out of my mouth and it became this this self perpetuating cycle which i mean it's you know if you're having fun great i mean if it if it's if it's if it's generative of useful information and and engagement professionally and and psychologically great but and and there you know there was some of that on twitter i mean there were people who i've connected with because i just you know one one of us dm'd the other on twitter and it was hard to see how that was gonna happen otherwise but it was largely just a machine for manufacturing unnecessary controversy do you think it's possible to avoid the drug of that so now that you've achieved the zen state is it possible for somebody like you to use it in a way that doesn't pull you into the whirlpool and so anytime there's a tax you just i mean that's how i tried to use it yeah but it's it's not the way i wanted to use it it's not the way it it it it promises itself as as a you wanted to have debate i wanted to actually communicate with people yeah i want i wanted to hear from the person because the again it's it's like being in afghanistan right it's like there there there are the the potted cases where it's obviously good right it's like in afghanistan the girl who's getting an education that is just here that's why we're here that's that's obviously good i've had those moments on twitter where it's okay i'm hearing from a smart person who's detected an error i made in my podcast or in a book or they've just got some great idea about something that i should spend time on and i would never have heard from this person in any other format and now i'm actually in dialogue with them and it's it's fantastic that's the promise of it to actually talk to people and so i i kept getting lured back into that no the the way the sane or you know sanity preserving way of of using it is is just as a marketing channel you just put your stuff out there and you don't look at what's coming back at you and that's you know for you know i'm on other social media platforms that i don't even touch i mean my team put post stuff on facebook and on instagram i never even see what's on there so you don't think it's possible to see something and not let it affect your mind no that that's definitely possible but the question is and i did that for vast stretches of time right and but then the the promise of the platform is dialogue and feedback right so like so why do my if i know for whatever reason i'm gonna see like ninety nine to one awful feedback you know bad faith feedback malicious feedback some of it's probably even bots and i'm not even aware of who's a person who's a bot right but i'm just gonna stare into this fun house mirror of acrimony and dishonesty that is going to i mean the the the reason why i got off is not because i couldn't recalibrate and and and find equanimity again with all the the the the nastiness that was coming back at me and not that i couldn't ignore it for vast stretches of time but i could see that i kept coming back to it hoping that it would be something that i could use a real tool for communication and i was noticing that it was insidiously changing the way i felt about people yeah both people i know and people i don't know right like people i you know mutual friends of ours who are behaving in certain ways on twitter which just seem insane to me and then i that became a signal i felt like i had to take into account somehow right you're seeing people at their worst both friends and strangers and i i felt that it was as much as i could sort of try to recalibrate for it i felt that i was losing touch with what was real information because people are performing people are faking people are not who themselves or they're they're you're seeing people at their worst and so i felt like alright what's at what's being advertised to me here on a not just a daily basis i you know a hourly basis or you know increments sometimes of you know multiple times an hour i mean i probably check twitter you know at minimum ten times a day and maybe i was checking it a hundred times a day on some days right where i would things were really active and i was really engaged with something what was being delivered into my brain there was a was subtly false information about how dishonest and you know just generally unethical totally normal people are capable of being right it was like it was it was a it is a fun house mirror it was it was i was seeing the most grotesque versions of people who i know right people who i know i could sit down and dinner with and they would never behave this way and yet they were they were coming at me on twitter and i mean it's it's it's it's it was essentially turning ordinary people into sociopaths right it's like people are just you know it's and there are analogies that many of us have made it's like it's like one analogy is road rage right like people behave in the confines of a car mhmm in ways that they never would if they didn't have this metal box around them you know and moving at speed and it's it's you know all that becomes quite hilarious and and you know obviously dysfunctional when they're actually have to stop at the light next to the person they just flipped off and they realize they didn't realize they didn't understand that the person coming out of that car next to them with cauliflower ear is someone who they never would have you know rolled their eyes at in public because they they would have taken one look at this person and realized this this is the last person you wanna fight with that's one of the heartbreaking things is to see see people who i know who i admire who i know are friends be everything from snarky to downright yeah mean derisive towards each other it doesn't make any sense like this this is the only place where i've seen people i really admire who have had a calm head about most things like really be shitty to other people it's probably the only place i've seen that and i don't i don't i tend i choose to maybe believe that that's not really them there's something about the system like if you go paintballing if you jordan peterson and go paintballing shoot your friends yeah yeah you're gonna shoot your friends but you kind of accept that that's kinda what you're doing in this little game that you're playing but it's sometimes hard to remind yourself of that well and i i think i was guilty of that definitely you know i i don't think there's nothing i i don't think i ever did anything that i really feel bad about but yeah it was always pushing me to the edge of snideness somehow and it's just not healthy it's not it's not so so the so the reason why i deleted my twitter account in the end was that it was obviously making me a worse person and and so and yeah is there some way to be on there where it's not making you a worse person i'm sure there is but it's given the nature of the platform and given what was coming back at me on it the way to do that is just to basically use as a one way channel of of communication just just just marketing you know it's like here here's what i what i'm paying attention to look at it if you want to and you just you just push it out and then you don't you don't look at what's coming back at you i put out a call for questions on twitter and then actually quite surprising there's a lot of good i mean they're they're like even if they're critical they're like being thoughtful which is nice i used it that way too and that was what kept me hooked but then there's also touch balls sixty nine wrote a question no ask what i can't imagine this part of it but one way to solve this is you know we've gotta get rid of anonymity for this it's like well let me ask the question ask sam why he sucks was the question yeah that's that's good well one one reason why i sucked was twitter that was and i i've since solved that problem so touch touch ball sixty nine sixty nine yeah touch ball sixty nine should be happy that i i i suck a little bit less now that i'm off twitter i mean the fact that have to hear from touch polls sixty nine on the regular the fact that you have to have to see that it probably can have a negative effect just even a moderation just to see that there is like for me the negative effect is slightly losing faith in the underlying kindness of humanity yeah but you that was for me yeah you can also just reason your way out of it saying that this is an enemy and this is kind of fun and this kind of just the the shit show of twitter it's okay but it does mentally affect you a little bit like i don't read too much into that kind of comment it's like that it's just that's just trolling and it's you know i i get what's i i i get understand the fun the person is having on the other side of that it's like do you though i do well i do i don't i mean i don't behave that way but i do and for all i know that person could be you know sixteen years old right so it's it's like it could be also an alt account for elon i don't know what what yes right yeah yeah yeah no i'm pretty sure elon would just tweet that on his own name at this point oh man but you love each other okay so the do you think so speaking of which now that elon has taken over twitter is there something that he could do to make this platform better this twitter and just social media in general but because of the aggressive nature of his innovation that he's pushing is there any way to make twitter a pleasant place for sam harris maybe like in the next five years i i don't know i'm i think i'm agnostic as to whether or not he or anyone could make a social media platform that really was healthy so you were just observing yourself week by week seeing the effect it has on your mind and on how much you're actually learning and growing as a person and it was negative yeah and i also seen the negativity in other people's lives i mean it's it's obvious i mean he's not gonna he's not gonna admit it but i think it's obviously negative for elon right and it's just not it's that was one of the things that you know you know when i was looking into the fun house mirror i was also seeing the the fun house mirror on his side of twitter and it was just even more exaggerated it's like when i when i was asking myself why is he spending his time this way i then reflected on why why you know why was i spending my time this way to a lesser degree right and at lesser scale and at lesser risk frankly right and so and it was just so it's not just twitter i mean it's it's this isn't part an internet phenomenon it's like the the the whole hunter biden mess that you you explored explored that was based on i mean it was on i was on somebody's podcast but that was based on a clip taken from that podcast which was highly misleading as to the the the general shape of my remarks on that podcast even you know i i had to then do my own podcast untangling all of that and admitting that even in even in the full context i was not speaking especially well and didn't say exactly what i thought in a way that was would have been recognizable to anyone you know even someone with not functioning by a a spirit of charity but but the clip was quite distinct from the podcast itself the reality is is that we're living in an environment now where people are so lazy and there's their their their attention is so fragmented that they they only have time for clips ninety nine percent of people will see a clip and will assume there's no relevant context i need to understand what happened in that clip right and obviously the people who make those clips know that right and they're doing that doing it quite maliciously and in this case the person who made that clip and subsequent clips of other podcasts was quite maliciously trying to engineer you know some reputational immolation for me and being signal boosted by elon and other prominent people who can't take the time to watch anything other than a clip even when it's their friend or someone who's ostensibly their friend in that clip right so it's a total failure and understandable failure of ethics that everyone is so short on time and they're so fucking lazy that the and and and that we now have these contexts in which we react so quickly to things right like twitter is inviting an instantaneous reaction to this clip that it's it's just too tempting to just say something and not know what you're even commenting on and most of most of the people who saw that clip don't understand what i what i actually think about any of these issues and the irony is people are gonna find clips from this conversation that are just as misleading mhmm and they're gonna export those and then people are gonna be dunking on those clips and you know we're all living and dying by clips now and it's it's dysfunctional see i i think it's possible to create a platform i i think we will keep living on clips but you know when i saw that clip of you talking about children and so on just knowing that you have a sense of humor you just went to a dark place in terms of humor right so like i didn't even bother and then i knew that the way clips work is that people will use it for virality's sake but the giving giving a person benefit of the doubt that's not even the right term it's not like i was it's really like interpreting it in the context of all of your past state even need like i even give trump the benefit of the doubt when i see a clip of trump so because there are famous clips of trump that are very misleading as to what he was saying in context and i've been honest about that like the whole you know there were good people on both sides scandal around the char his remarks after charlottesville like the clip that got exported and got promoted by everyone you know left of center from biden on down you know the new york times cnn there's there's nobody that i'm aware of who has honestly you know apologized for what they did with that clip that clip he did not say what he seemed to be saying in that clip about the the nazis at charlottesville right and i've have always been very clear about that so it's just you know i i even even people who i think should be marginalized and people who who who should be defenestrated because they really are terrible people who are doing dangerous things and for bad reasons i think we should be honest about what they actually meant in context right and and this this goes to anyone else we might talk about you know who are who's more where the where the case is much more confusing but mhmm yeah so everyone's it's just so and then it i'm sure we're gonna get to ai but you know the the prospect of being able to manufacture clips with ai and deepfakes and that where it's gonna be hard for most people most of the time to even figure out that the the whether they're in the presence of something real you know forget about being divorced from context there was no context i mean that is a it's that's an a misinformation apocalypse that is we are right on the cusp of and you know it's it's terrifying oh it could be just a new world like where alice going to wonderland where humor is the only thing we have and they will save us maybe in the end trump's approach to social media was the right one after all nothing is true and everything's absurd yeah but we can't live that way people function on the basis of what they assume is true right they think you know people have functioned well to do anything it's like i mean you have to you have to know what you think is gonna happen or or you have to at least give a probabilistic weighting over the future otherwise you're you're gonna be incapacitated by you're not gonna like people want certain things and they have to have a rational plan to get those desires gratified and they don't wanna die they don't want their kids to die you tell them that there's a comet hurtling toward earth and they should get outside and look up right they're gonna do it and if it turns out it's misinformation you know it's it's it's gonna matter because it comes down to like what medicines do you give your children right like we're we're gonna be manufacturing fake journal articles i mean this is i'm sure someone's using chat g p t for for this reader as we speak mhmm and if it's not credible if it's not persuasive now to most people i mean honestly i don't think we're gonna it's it's i'll be amazed if it's a year before we we can actually create journal articles that it would take you know a a phd to debunk that are completely fake and there are people who are celebrating this kind of you know coming cataclysm but i i just it's just they're the people who don't have anything to lose who we're celebrating it or just are so confused that they just don't even know what's at stake and then there are the people who have met the few people who we could count on a few hands who have managed to insulate themselves or at least imagine they've insulate insulated themselves from the downside here enough that they're not implicated in the great unraveling we are witnessing or could could witness the shaking up of what is true so actually that returns us to experts do you think experts can save us is there such thing as expertise and experts at something how do you know if you've achieved it i think it's it's important to acknowledge upfront that this there's something paradoxical about how we relate to to authority especially within science and i don't think that paradox is going away and it's just it doesn't have to be confusing it's just it's and it's not it's not truly a paradox it's just like there are different moments in time so it is true to say that within science or within any within rationality generally i i mean just when whenever you're making it having a fact based discussion mhmm about anything it is true to say that the truth or falsity of a statement does not even slightly depend on the credentials of the person making the statement right so it doesn't matter if you're a nobel laureate you can be wrong right the thing you could either the last sentence you spoke could be total bullshit right and it's also possible for someone who's deeply uninformed to be right about something or and or to be right for the wrong reasons right or or someone just gets lucky or someone or or and there there are middling cases where you have like a a backyard astronomer who's got no credentials but he just loves astronomy and he's got a telescope and it's he spends a lot of time looking at the night sky and he discovers a comet that no one else has seen you know not even the professional expert astronomers and my god i think that happens less and less now but but some version of that keeps happening and it and it may always keep happening in every area of expertise right so it's true that truth is orthogonal to the reputational concerns we have among apes who are talking about the truth but it is also true that most of the time real experts are much more reliable than frauds or people who are not experts right or you know so and expertise really is a thing right and when it's you know when you're flying an airplane in a in a storm you don't want just randos come into the cockpit saying listen i've got a new idea about how to you know how we should tweak these controls right you want someone who's a trained pilot and and and that training gave them something right it gave them a set of competences and intuitions and they they know what all those dials and switches do right and i don't right i shouldn't be flying that plane so when things really matter you know and put in this at thirty thousand feet in a storm sharpens this up we want real experts to be in charge right and we are at thirty thousand feet a lot of the time on a lot of issues right and whether they're public health issues whether it's issue whether it's a geopolitical emergency like ukraine climate change i mean just pick your pick your topic there are real problems and the clock is rather often ticking and their solutions are non obvious right and and so expertise is a thing and deferring to experts much of the time makes a lot of sense it's at minimum it it prevents spectacular errors of incompetence and and just you know foolhardiness but it even in in the case of some where where you're talking about someone i mean people like ourselves who are like we're well educated we we're not the the worst possible candidates for you know the the dunning kruger effect when we're going into a new area where we're not experts we're fairly alert to the possibility that we don't you know it's not as simple as things seem at first and we don't you know we don't know how our tools translate to this new area we can be fairly circumspect but we're also because we're well educated we we can and we're pretty quick studies we can learn a lot of things pretty fast and we can begin to play a language game that sounds fairly expert right and in that case the the invitation to do your own research right is in when when times are good i view as an invitation to waste your time pointlessly mhmm right when times are good now the truth is times are not all that good right and we have the the ongoing public display of failures of expertise we have experts who are obviously corrupted by bad incentives we've got experts who you know perversely won't admit they were wrong when they in fact you know are demonstrated to be wrong we've got institutions that have been captured by political ideology that's not truth tracking i mean this this this whole woke encroachment into really every place you know whether it's universities or science journals or government or i mean it's just like that is that has been genuinely deranging so there's a lot going on that where where experts and and the very concept of expertise has seemed to discredit itself but the reality is is that there is a massive difference when anything matters when there's anything to know about anything there's a massive difference most of the time between someone who has really done the work to understand that domain and someone who hasn't and if i get sick or someone close to me gets sick you know i i have a phd in neuroscience right so i can read a medical journal article and understand a lot of it right and i you know so i'm i'm just fairly conversant with you know medical terminology and i understand its methods and i i'm alert to the difference because i've you know because in neuroscience i've spent hours and hours in journal clubs you know diagnosing you know the and analyzing the difference between good and bad studies i'm i'm alert to the difference between good and bad studies in in medical journals right and i understand that bad studies can get published and you know etcetera and and and experiments can be poorly designed i'm alert to all of those things but when i get sick or when someone close to me gets sick i don't pretend to be a doctor right i don't i've got no clinical experience i don't go down the rabbit hole on google for days at a stretch trying to become a doctor much less a specialist in the domain of problem that has been visited upon me or my family right so if someone close to me gets cancer i don't pretend to be an oncologist i don't go ahead and start re i don't start reading you know in journals of oncology and try to really get up to speed as an oncologist because it's it's not it's one is a one is a bad and potent and very likely misleading use of my time right and it it and it's if i decide if i had if i had a lot of runway if i decide okay it's really important for me to know everything i can at this point i wanna i know someone's gonna get cancer i may not go back to school and become an oncologist but what i wanna do is i wanna know everything i can know about cancer right so i'm gonna take the next four years and spend most of my time on cancer okay i could do that right i still think that's a waste of my time mhmm i still think at the end of even at the end of those four years i'm not gonna be the best person to to form intuitions about what to do in the face of the next cancer that that i have to confront i'm still gonna want a better oncologist than i've become to tell me what he or she would do if they were in my shoes or in the shoes of you know my family member i'm gonna you know what i'm what i'm not advocate i'm not advocating a a blind trust in authority like if you get cancer and you're talking to one oncologist and they're recommending some course of treatment by all means get a second opinion get a third opinion right but it matters that those opinions are coming from real experts and not from you know robert kennedy junior you know who's telling you that you know you got it because you got a you know a vaccine right it's like so it's just it it it there's we're swimming in a sea of misinformation where you've got people who are moving the opinions of millions of others who sh who should not have an opinion on these topics like there's no there is no scenario in which you should be getting your opinion about vaccine safety or or climate change or the war in ukraine or anything else that we might wanna talk about from candace owens right it's just like it like the like she she's not a relevant expert on any of those topics and what's more she doesn't seem to care right and and and she's living in a culture that has that has amplified that not caring into a business model an effective business model right so it's just it's and that there's something very trumpian about all that like that's that's the the the problem is is the culture it's not these these specific individuals so so the paradox here is that expertise is a real thing and we defer to it a lot as a as a labor saving device and just as and just based on the the the the reality that it's very hard to be a polymath right and specialization is a thing right and so the people who specialize in a very narrow topic they know more about that topic than the next guy no matter how smart that that guy or gal is and and that those differences matter but it's also true that when you're talking about facts sometimes the the the best experts are wrong the scientific consensus is wrong you get a a a sea change in the thinking of a whole field because one person who's an outlier for whatever reason decides okay i'm you know i'm gonna prove this point and they prove it right so somebody like the doctor who believe that that stomach ulcers were not due to stress but were due to h pylori infections right so he just drank a vial of h pylori bacteria and and proved that and then quickly got an ulcer and convinced the field that that at minimum h pylori was involved in in that process okay so yes everyone was wrong that doesn't disprove the reality of expertise it doesn't disprove the utility of relying on experts most of the time especially in an emergency especially when the clock is ticking especially when you're you know you're you're in this particular cockpit and you only have one chance to land this plane right you want the real pilot at the controls but there's just a few things to say go so one you mentioned this example with cancer and doing your own research there there are several things that are different about our particular time in history one doing your own research has become more and more effective because you can read the internet made information a lot more accessible so you can read a lot of different meta analyses you can read blog posts that describe to you exactly the flaws in the different papers that make up the meta meta analyses they and and you can read a lot of those blog posts that are conflicting with each other and you can take that information in and in a short amount of time you can start to make good faith interpretations for example i don't know i i don't wanna overstate things but if you suffer from depression for example then there you could go to an expert and a doctor that prescribes you some medication yeah but you could also challenge some of those ideas in seeing like what are the different medication what are the different side effects what are the different solutions to depression all that kind of stuff and i think depression is just a really difficult problem that's very i don't wanna again state incorrect things but i think it's there's a lot of variability of what depression really means so it it being introspective about the type of depression you have and the different possible solutions you have the just doing your own research as a first step before approaching a doctor or as you have multiple opinions could be very beneficial in that case now that's depression that's something that's been studied for a very long time with a new pandemic that's affecting everybody the it's you know with the airplane would equate it to like nine eleven or something like the the the new emergency just happened and everybody every expert in the world is publishing on it and talking about it mhmm so doing your own research there could be exceptionally effective in asking questions and then there's a difference between experts virologists and it's actually a good question who is exactly the expert in a pandemic yeah but there's the actual experts doing the research and publishing stuff and then there's the communicators of that expertise and the question is if the communicators are flawed to to a degree where doing your own research is actually the more effective way to figure out policies and solutions because you're not competing with experts you're competing with the communicators of expertise that could be who cdc in the case of the pandemic or politicians or political type of science figures like anthony fauci there's a question there of the effectiveness of doing your research your own research in that context and the competing forces there incentives that you've mentioned is you can be become quite popular by being contrarian by saying everybody's lying to you all the authorities are lying to you all the institutions are lying to you so those are the waters you're swimming in yeah but i think doing your own research in that kind of context could be quite effective let me be clear i'm not saying you shouldn't do any research right i'm not saying that you shouldn't be informed about an issue i'm not saying you shouldn't read articles on on whatever the topic is and yeah yes if i got cancer or someone close to me got cancer i i i i probably would read more about cancer than i've read thus far about cancer and i've read some so i'm not i'm not making a virtue of ignorance and a blind obedience to authority and i and again i recognize that that authorities can can discredit themselves or they can be wrong they can be wrong even when they had when there's no discredit there's just there's a lot we don't understand about the the nature of the world but still this vast gulf between truly informed opinion and bullshit exists it always exists and and conspiracy thinking is rather often you know most of the time the species of bullshit but it's not always wrong right there are real conspiracies and there there really are just awful corruptions of you know born of bad incentives within our you know our scientific processes within institutions and again we've mentioned a a lot of these things in passing but you know what what woke political ideology did to scientific communication during the pandemic was awful and it was really corrosive of public trust especially on the on the right for understandable reasons and it was just it was crazy some of the things that were being said and still is and these cases are all different you take depression we just don't know enough about depression for anyone to be that confident about anything right and there are many different modalities in which to interact with it as a problem right so there's yes pharmaceuticals have whatever promise they have but there's there's certainly reason to be concerned that they don't work well for everybody and and and that's it's obvious they don't work well for everybody but they do work for some people but again depression is a multifactorial problem and there there are different levels at which to to influence it and there are you know there are things like meditation there are things like just life changes and and you know one of the perverse things about depression is that when you're depressed all of the things that would be good for you to do are precisely the things you don't wanna do you don't have any energy to socialize you don't wanna get things done you don't wanna exercise you don't and all of those things if you got those up and running they do make you feel better in you know in the aggregate but the reality is that there you know there are clinical level depressions that are so bad that it's just we just don't have good tools for them and it's not enough to tell there's no life change someone's gonna gonna embrace that it's going to be an obvious remedy for that the pan i mean pandemics are are obviously a a complicated problem but i i would consider it much simpler than depression in terms of you know what's on the menu to be this chosen among you know the various choices it's less multifactorial the logic by which you would make those choices yeah so it's like we have a virus we have a new virus it's some version of bad you know it's human transmissible we're still catching up we're catching up to every aspect of it know how it spreads we don't know how we we how effective masks are well at a certain point we knew it was respiratory but we knew but but but yep and whether it's we had spread by fomites and like all that we were confused about a lot of things and we're still confused it's been a moving target this whole time and it's been changing this whole time and our responses to it have been you know we we ramped up the vaccines as quickly as we as we could but you know too quick for some not as not quick enough for others we could have done human challenge trials and got them out more quickly with with with better data and i think that's something we should probably look at in the future because you know that to my eye that would make ethical sense to do to do challenge trials but and and so much of my concern about covid i mean many people are confused about my concern about covid my my concern about covid has for much of the time not been narrowly focused on covid itself and how dangerous i perceive covid to be as a as a illness it has been for the longest time even more concern about our ability to respond to a truly scary pathogen next time like what i i for you know outside those initial months you know give me the the first six months to be quite worried about covid and and the unraveling of society but and the supply of toilet paper you wanna secure a steady supply of toilet paper but beyond the that initial period when we had a sense of what we were dealing with and we had every hope that the vaccines are actually gonna work and we're getting and we knew we're getting those vaccines in short order right beyond that and and we had and and we knew just how dangerous the the illness was and how dangerous it wasn't for years now i've just been worrying about this as a failed dress rehearsal for something much worse right i think what we prove to ourselves at this moment in history is that we have built informational tools that we do not know how to use to and we have made ourselves we we basically enrolled all of human society into a psychological experiment that is deranging us and making it virtually impossible to solve coordination problems that we absolutely have to solve next time when things are worse do you understand who's at fault for the way this unraveled the way we didn't seem to have the distrust in institutions and the institution of science that grew like seemingly exponentially or got or or got revealed through this process who who's at fault here and what's to fix so much blame to go around but so much of it is not a matter of bad people conspiring to do bad things it's a matter of incompetence and misaligned incentives and just just ordinary you know just plain vanilla dysfunction but my problem was that people like you people like brett weinstein people like that i look to for reasonable difficult conversations on difficult topics have a little bit lost their mind became emotional and dogmatic in style of conversation perhaps not in the depth of actual ideas but they're i you know i tweet something of that nature and not about you but just it feels like the pandemic made people really more emotional than before and then kimbal musk responded i think something i think you probably would agree with maybe not i think it was the combo of trump and the pandemic trump triggered the far left to be way more active than they could have been without him and then the pandemic handed big government nanny state lefties a huge platform on a silver platter a one two punch and here we are i would agree with some of that i i'm not sure how much to read into the nanny state concept but but yeah like basically got people on the far left really activated yeah and then gave control to i don't know if you say nanny state but just control to government that when executed poorly has created a complete distrust in government my fear is that there was gonna be that complete distrust anyway given the nature of the information space given the level of conspiracy thinking given the gaming of of these tools by an anti vax cult i mean there really is an anti vax cult that that just ramped up its its energy during this moment but it's a small one it's it's not to say that everything every concern about vaccines is a species of it was born of misinformation or born of this cult but there is a cult that is just you know and and you know and the core of trumpism is a cult i mean you know qanon is a cult and so there's a lot of lying and there's a lot of confusion you know there there are it's almost impossible to exaggerate how confused some people are and how and how fully their their lives are organized around that confusion i mean there are people who think that the world's being run by pedophile cannibals and that you know tom hanks and oprah winfrey and michelle obama are among those cannibals i mean like they're adjacent to the pure crazy there's the semi crazy and adjacent to the semi crazy there's the grifting opportunist asshole and and the the the the the layers of of of bad faith are you know hard to fully diagnose but the problem is all of this is getting signal boosted by a a an outrage machine that is preferentially spreading misinformation it has a business model that is is guaranteeing that is is preferentially sharing misinformation can i actually just on a small tangent yeah how do you defend yourself against the claim that you're a pedophile cannibal it's difficult to here's the case i would make yeah because i don't think you can use reason i think you have to use empathy you have to understand how but what but what like part of it i mean i i i find it very difficult to believe that anyone believes these things i mean i think that there's and there's i'm sure there's some number of people who are just pretending to believe these things because it's just again this is sort of like the forechanification of everything it's just it's just a it's just it's just it's just pepe the frog right like none of this is what it seems they're not signaling an alliance with white supremacy or neo nazism but they're not not doing it like they just don't fucking care it's just cynicism overflowing its banks right it's just fun to to to wind up the normies right like look at all the normies who don't understand that a green frog is just a green frog even when it isn't just a green frog right it's like they're just it's just gumming up everyone's cognitive bandwidth with bullshit right i get that that's fun if you're a teenager and you just wanna vandalize our our noosphere but at a certain point you we have to recognize that real questions of human welfare are in play right there's like there really there is this there are wars getting fought or not fought and there's a pandemic raging and there's medicine to take or not take but i mean to come back to this issue of covid i don't think my i don't think i got so out of balance around covid i i think people are quite confused about what i was concerned about i mean like i there was a yes there was a period where i was crazy because anyone who was taking it seriously was crazy because they had no idea what was going on and so it's like yes i was wiping down packages with with alcohol wipes right because people thought it was transmissible by touch right that's so and then when we realized that was no longer the case i stopped doing that but so there there again it was it was a moving target and a lot of things we did in hindsight around masking and school closures looks fairly dysfunctional right but it's unnecessary i think the criticism that people would would say about your talking about covid and maybe you can correct me but you were skeptic or you were against skepticism of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine so people who get nervous about the vaccine but don't fall into the usual anti vax camp which i think there was a significant yeah yeah that was enough number oh yeah they're asking they're getting nervous i mean i especially after the war in afghanistan and iraq i too was nervous about anything where a lot of money could be made and you you start you just see how the people who are greedy who come they come to the surface all of a sudden and then a lot of them that run institutions are actually really good human beings i know a lot of them but it's hard to know how those two combine together when there's hundreds of billions trillions of dollars to be made and so that skepticism i i i guess you the the sense was that you weren't open enough to the skepticism i understand that people have that sense i'll tell you how i thought about it and think about it one again it was a moving target so there was a point in the timeline where it was totally rational to expect that the vaccines were were both working but but but both they were they were reasonably safe and that and that covid was reasonably dangerous and that the trade off for basically everyone was it was rational to get vaccinated given how many given the level of testing and how many people had been vaccinated before you given what we were seeing with covid right that that was a forced choice you're either gonna you're eventually gonna get covid and the question is do you wanna be vaccinated when you do right there was a period where that forced choice where it it was just obviously reasonable to get vaccinated in especially because there was every reason to expect that while it wasn't a perfectly sterilizing vaccine it was going to knock down transmission a lot and that matters and so it wasn't just a personal choice you were actually being a good citizen when you decided to run whatever risk you you were gonna run to get vaccinated because there are people in our society who can't actually can't get vaccinated i mean i know people who can't take any vaccines they're so they're so allergic to i mean they they in their own person seem to justify all of the fears of the anti vaxx cult i mean it's like they're the kind of person who robert kennedy junior can point to and say see vaccines are will will fucking kill you right because because of the the experience that and they and we're still they i know people who have kids who fit that description right so we should all feel a civic responsibility to be vaccinated against egregiously awful and transmit transmissible diseases for which we have relatively safe vaccines to keep those sorts of people safe and there was a period of time when it was thought that the vaccine could stop transmission yes and so again all of this has has begun to shift i don't think it has shifted as much as bret weinstein thinks it's shifted but yes there are safety concerns around the mrna vaccines especially for young men right as far as far as i know that's the that's the purview of the of of actual heightened concern but also there's there's now there's a lot of natural immunity out there a lot basically everyone who was who was gonna get vaccinated has gotten vaccinated the virus has evolved to the point in in in this context where it seems less dangerous you know again i don't i i i i'm going more on on the siemens than on on research that i've done at the at this point but i'm certainly less worried about getting covid i've had it once i've been vaccinated i've like it's like so you ask me now how do i feel about getting the next booster i don't know that i'm going to get the next booster right so so i i was somebody who was waiting in line at four in the morning you know hoping to get get a some overflow vaccine when it was first available and i that was at that point given what we knew or given what i thought i knew based on the best sources i could consult and based on you know based on anecdotes that were too vivid to ignore you know both data and and personal experience it was totally rational for me to to wanna get that vaccine as as soon as i could and now i think it's totally rational for me to to do a a a different kind of cost benefit analysis and wonder listen do i really need to get a booster right you know like how many of the how many of these boosters am i gonna get for the rest of my life really and how safe is the mrna vaccine for a man of my age right and do i need to be worried about myocarditis for you know all of that is completely rational to talk about now my concern is that at every point along the way i was the wrong person and and and brett weinstein was the wrong person and there's many other people i could add to this list to have strong opinions about any of this stuff i just disagree with that i i think yes in theory i agree one hundred percent but i feel like experts failed at communicating not at doing they did i i and i just feel like you and bret weinstein actually have the tools with the internet given the engine you have in your brain of thinking for months at a time deeply about the problems that face our world that you actually have the tools to do pretty good thinking here it's the problem i have with experts but there would be deference to experts and pseudo experts behind all of that well the papers you would stand on the shoulders of giants but you can surf those shoulders better than the giants themselves yeah but i knew we were gonna disagree about the like i i i saw his podcast where he brought on these experts who had many of them had the right credentials but for variety of reasons they didn't pass the smell test for me maybe the the the one larger problem and this goes back to the the problem of of how we rely on authority in science is that you can always find a phd or an md to to champion any crackpot idea right you could you could i mean it is amazing but you could find phds and mds who would sit up there in front of congress and say that they thought smoking was not addictive you know or that it was not harmful to to there was no direct link between smoking and lung cancer you can always find those people and you can and so but you know some of the people brett found were people who had obvious tells to my point of view to my eye i mean and i saw them on some of the same people who were on rogan's podcast right and and it's hard because if a person does have the right credentials and they're not and they're not saying something floridly mistaken and we're talking about something where it's they're genuine unknowns right like how how much do we know about the safety of these vaccines right it's it's at that point not a whole hell of a lot i mean we have no long term data on mrna vaccines but to confidently say that millions of people are gonna die because of these vaccines and to confidently say that ivermectin is a panacea right ivermectin is the thing that prevents covid right mhmm there was no good reason to say either of those things at that moment and that's and that and so given that that's where brett was i felt like there was there was just no there was nothing to debate we're we're both the wrong people to get be getting into the weeds on this we're both gonna defer to our chosen experts his experts look like crackpots to me and or at least the ones who are most vociferous on those most on those edgiest points that seem most and your experts seem like what is the term mass hysteria i forgot the term well it's no but it's like it's like with you know climate science i mean there's this this old it's received as a canard for for in half of our society now but the claim that ninety seven percent of climate scientists agree that human caused climate change is a thing right so do you go with the ninety seven percent most of the time or do you go with the three percent most of the time it's obvious you go with the ninety seven percent most of the time for anything that matters it's not to say that the three percent are always wrong again the the there are things get overturned and yes as you say and i've spent much more time worrying about this on my podcast than i've spent worrying about covid our institutions have lost trust for good reason right and and it's it it's an open question whether we can actually get things done with this level of transparency and and pseudo transparency given our information ecosystems like can we fight a war really fight a war that we may have to fight like the next nazis can we fight that war when everyone with an iphone is showing just how awful it is that with that little girls get blown up when we drop our bombs right it's like could we could we as a society do what we might have to do to to get actually get necessary things done when we're living in this this panopticon of just you know everyone's a journalist right everyone's a scientist everyone's an expert everyone's got direct contact with the facts or or some or a semblance of the facts i don't know i think yes and i think voices like yours are exceptionally important and i think there's certain signals you send in your ability to steal me on the other side in your empathy essentially so that's the fight that's the mechanism by which you resist the dog the dogmatism of these this binary thinking and then if you become a trusted person that's able to consider the other side then people would listen to you as as the aggregator as the communicator of expertise because the virologists haven't been able to be good communicators i still to this day don't really know what is the what am i supposed to think about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines today as it stands today right what are we supposed to think what are we supposed to think about testing what are we supposed to think about the effectiveness of masks or lockdowns where's the great communicators on this topic that consider all the other conspiracy theories all the other all the communication that's out there and actually aggregating it together and being able to say this is actually what's most likely the truth and also some of that has to do with humility epistemic humility knowing that you can't really know for sure just like with depression you can't really know for sure yeah where is the i i'm not seeing those communications being effectively done even still today well i mean the the jury is still out on some of it and again it's a moving target and and some of it i mean it's complicated some of it's a self fulfilling dynamic where sure like so like lockdowns in theory lockdowns a lockdown would work if we could only do it but we can't really do it and there's a lot of people who won't do it because they're convinced that it's this is the totalitarian boot you know on finally on the neck of the of of of the good people who are always having their interests introduced by the elites right so like this is if you have enough people who think the lockdown for any reason in the face of any conceivable illness right is just code for the new world order coming to fuck you over and take your guns right okay you have a society that is now immune to reason right because there there are absolutely certain pathogens that we should lock down for next time right and and and it was completely rational in the beginning of this thing to lock down given to attempt to lock down we never really locked down to attempt some semblance of a lockdown just to quote bend the curve to spare our health care system given what we were seeing happen in in italy right like that moment was was not hard to navigate at least in in my view it was obvious at the time in retrospect my views on that haven't changed except for the fact that i recognize maybe it's it's just impossible given the nature of people's response to that kind of demand right we live in a society that's just not gonna lock down unless the pandemic is much more deadly right so that's a point i made which you know was maliciously clipped out from some other podcast where someone's trying to make it look like i wanna see children die look there's a pity more children didn't didn't die from covid right this is it's actually the same person who who and that's the other thing that got so poisoned here it's like that person this this psychopath or effective psychopath who's creating these clips of me on podcast the second clip of me seeming to say that i wish more children died during covid which but it was it was so i i was so it was so clear in context what i was saying that even the clip betrayed the context so it didn't actually work this psycho and again i don't know whether he actually is a psychopath but he's behaving like one because of the incentives of twitter this is somebody who brett signal boosted as a as a very reliable source of information right he he kept retweeting this guy at me against me right and this guy at one glance i knew how unreliable this guy was right but i think i i'm not at all set one thing i think i did wrong one thing that i do regret one thing i have not sorted out for myself is how to navigate the the professional and personal pressure that gets applied at this moment where you have a friend or an acquaintance or someone you know who's behaving badly in public or or or behaving badly behaving in a way that you think is bad in public and they have a public platform where they're influencing a lot of people and you have your own public platform where you're constantly getting asked to comment on what this this friend or or acquaintance or colleague is doing i haven't known what i think is ethically right about the choices that seem forced on us in at moments like this so like i've i've criticized you in public about your your interview with kanye mhmm now in the case in in that case i reached out to you in private first and told you exactly what i thought and then when i was gonna get asked in public or when i was touching that topic on my podcast i more or less said the same thing that i said to you in private right now that was how i navigated that moment i did the same thing with with elon at least on at the beginning you know this we have we have maintained good vibes that which is which is not what i say about elon but i don't think i i i disagree with you because good vibes in the moment there's a deep core of good vibes that persists through time between you and elon and i would argue probably between some of the other folks you mentioned i i think with brett i failed to reach out in private to the degree that i should have and we we never really had a a we we had tried to set up a conversation in private that that never happened but there was some communication but it would have been much better for me to have made more of an effort in private than i did before it spilled out into public and i would say that's true with other people as well what kind of interaction in private do you think you should have with brett because my case would be beforehand and now still the case i would like in this part of the criticism you sent my way maybe it's useful to go to that direction actually let let's go to that direction because i think i disagree with your criticism as you stated publicly but this is of your of your kind of yeah the thing you criticized me for is actually the right thing to do with brett okay you you said lex could have spoken with kanye in such a way as to have produced a useful document he didn't do that because he has a fairly naive philosophy about the power of love well see if you can maintain that philosophy in the presence of the criticism yeah he see no it's beautiful he seemed to think that if he just got through the minefield to the end of the conversation or the two of them still were feeling good about one another and they can hug it out that would be by definition a success so let me make the case for this power of love philosophy right and first of all i i love you sam you're still an inspiration and somebody i deeply admire okay i got you the to me in the case of kanye it's not only that you get to the conversation and have hugs it's that the display that you're willing to do that has power so even if it doesn't end in hugging the actual the turning the other cheek the act of turning the other cheek itself communicates both to kanye later and to the rest of the world that we should have empathy and compassion towards each other there is power to that i the maybe that is naive but i believe in the power of that so it's not that i'm trying to convince kanye that some of his ideas are wrong but i'm trying to illustrate that just the act of listening and truly trying to understand the human being that is opens people's minds to actually questioning their own beliefs more it takes them out of the dogmatism deescalates the kind of dogmatism that i've been seeing so in that sense i would say the power of love is is the is the philosophy you might apply to brett because the right conversation you have in private is not about hey listen you're you know the the experts you're talking to they seem credentialed but they're not actually as credentialed as as they're illustrating they're not grounding their findings in actual meta analysis and papers and so on like making a strong case like what are you doing this is gonna get a lot of people in trouble but instead just saying like being a friend in the dumbest of ways being like respectful sending love their way and just having a conversation outside of all of this outside like basically so showing that like removing the emotional attachment to this debate even though you are very emotionally attached because in the case of covid specifically there is a very large number of lives at stake but removing all of that and remembering that you have a friendship yeah well so the i think these are highly nonanalogous cases right so your your conversation with kanye misfired from my point of view for a very different reason it was and it was it has to do with kanye i mean so kanye i don't i don't know i have never met kanye so obviously i don't know him but i think he's either obviously in the midst of a mental health crisis or he's a colossal asshole or both i mean those aren't mutually exclusive so one of three possibility he's either mentally ill he's an asshole or he's he's mentally ill and an asshole i think all three of those possibilities are possible for the both of us as well in one moment i would argue none of those are are are right likely for either of us but possible not not to say we don't have our moments but so so the reason not to talk to kanye so you i i think you should have had the conversation you had with him in private that's great and there's no i have got no criticism of what you said had it been in private in pub i just thought you're not doing him a favor if if he's mentally ill right if he's in the middle of a manic episode or or you know i'm not a clinician but i've you know heard it said of him that he is bipolar you're not doing him a favor sticking a mic in front of him and letting him go off on the jews or anything else right we know what he thought about the jews we know that there's not much illumination that's gonna come from him on that topic and if it is a symptom of his mental illness that he thinks these things well then you're not doing him a favor making that even more public if he's just an asshole and he's just an anti semite you know an ordinary you know garden variety anti semite well then there's also not much to say unless you're really gonna dig in and kick the shit out of him in public and i'm i'm saying you can do that with love i mean that's the other thing here is that i don't agree that compassion and love always have this patient embracing acquiescent face right i i they they don't always feel good to the recipient right there is a sword of wisdom that you can wield compassionately in moments like that where someone's full of shit and you just make it absolutely clear to them and to your audience that they're full of shit and it's no there's no hatred being communicated in fact you could just it's like listen i'm gonna do everyone a favor right now and you know just take your foot out of your mouth and and and the truth is you know i wouldn't i just wouldn't have aired the conversation like i just don't think it was a document that had to get out there right i i i get that many peep this is not a signal you're likely to get from your audience right i get that many people in your audience thought oh my god that's awesome you're talking to kanye and you're doing it in lex style where it's just love and you're not treating him like a pariah and you know you're you're holding this tension between he's this creative genius who is work we love and yet he's having this moment that's so painful and what a tight rope walk and i get that maybe ninety percent of your audience saw it that way they're still wrong and i and i and i i still think that was on balance not a good thing to put out into the world you don't think it opens up the mind and heart of people that listen to that just have it seeing a person it does it's it's let if it's opening up in the wrong direction where just gale force nonsense is coming in right i i think we should have an open mind and an open heart but there's some clear things here that that we have to keep in view one is the mental illness component is its own thing yeah i don't pretend to understand what's going on with him so but insofar as that's the reason he's saying what he's saying do not put this guy on camera and let know that sorry on that point real quick i had a bunch of conversation with him offline and i didn't get a sense of mental illness that's why i chose to sit down okay and i didn't get it i mean mental illness is such a but when it shows up in a gimp hood on alex jones' podcast i mean this is that either that's more you know genius performance in his world or it's he he's unraveling further i wouldn't put that under mental illness i we have to i think there's another conversation to be had about how we treat artists right because they're they're weirdos they're very i mean we you know taking taking words from kanye as if he he's like christopher hitchens or something like that like very eloquent researched you know written many books on history on politics on geopolitics on psychology kanye didn't do any of that he's an artist just spouting off and so there's a different style of conversation and different way to treat the words that are coming out of the let's leave the mental illness aside so if if if we're gonna say that there's no reason to think he's mentally ill and this is just him being creative and brilliant and opinionated well then that falls into the asshole bucket for me it's like then then he's someone and honestly the most offensive thing about him in that interview from my point of view is not the antisemitism which you know we can talk about so i think there there are problems just letting him spread those memes as well but the most offensive thing is just how delusionally egocentric he is or was coming off in that interview and and in others like he he has an estimation of himself as this omnibus genius to to to rival not only to rival shakespeare to exceed shakespeare right i mean it's like he's he is the greatest mind that has ever walked among us and he's more or less explicit on that point and yet he manages to talk for hours without saying anything actually interesting or insightful or or factually illuminating right so it's complete delusion of a very trumpian sort it's like it's like you know when trump says he's a genius who understands everything it's like but nobody takes him seriously and one wonders whether trump takes himself seriously kanye seems to believe he he seems to believe his own press he actually thinks he's he's you know just a colossus and he may be a great musician you know i'm not you know i i've certainly not my wheelhouse to compare him to any other musicians but one thing that's patently obvious in from your conversation is he's not who he thinks he is intellectually or ethically or in any other relevant way and so when you couple that to the antisemitism he was spreading which i was genuinely noxious and ill considered and has potential knock on effects in the black community i mean there's a there's an there's an ambient level of antisemitism in the black community that is worth worrying about and talking about anyway there's a bunch of guys you know playing the knockout game in brooklyn just punching orthodox jews in the face and i think letting kanye air his antisemitism that publicly only raises the the likelihood of that rather than diminishes it i don't know so let me say just a couple of things so one my belief at the time was it doesn't it decreases it showing empathy while pushing back decreases likelihood of that it does might it might on the surface look like it's increasing it but that's simply because the antisemitism or the hatred in general is brought to the surface and that people talk talk about it but i should also say that you're one of the only people that wrote to me privately criticizing me and like out of the people i really respect and admire and that was really valuable that i had to painful because i had to think through it for a while yeah and still it still haunts me because the other kind of criticism i got a lot of people basically said things towards me based on who i am that they hate me just just you mean anti semitic things or that you're anti semitic things i just hate the word anti semitic it's it's like racist well but here's the reality so i'm someone so i'm jewish you know although obviously not religious i have never taken you know i've i've been a student of the holocaust obviously i i know a lot about that and and there's reason to to be a student of the holocaust but in my lifetime and in my experience i have never taken antisemitism very seriously i have not worried about it i have not made a thing of it i've done exactly one podcast on it i had barry weiss on my podcast when her book came out but it really is a thing and it's it's something we have to keep an eye on societally because it it it's a it's a unique kind of hatred right it's a it's a it's unique in that it seems it's it's knit together with it's not just ordinary racism it's it's knit together with lots of conspiracy theories that never seem to die out it's it can by turns equally animate the left and the right politically i mean what's so perverse about antisemitism look in the american context with the far right you know with white supremacists jews aren't considered white so they they hate us in the same spirit in which they hate black people or or brown people or anyone who's not white but on the left jews are considered extra white i mean we're we're we're we're the extra the black community that is often the case right we're we're a minority that has thrived and so and and it and it seems to stand as a counterpoint to all of the problems of of that other minorities suffer in particular you know african americans in the american context and yeah asians are now getting a little bit of this you know like the the the model minority issue but jews have had this going on for centuries and and millennia and it never seems to go away and it's again this is something that i've never focused on but this has been at a slow boil for as long as we've been alive and there's no guarantee it can't suddenly become much much uglier than we have any reason to to expect it to become even in in our society and so there's this there's kind of a special concern at moments like that where you have an immensely influential person in a community who already has a checkered history with respect to their own beliefs about the jews and the conspiracies and all the rest and he's just messaging you know not especially fully opposed by you and anyone else who's who's given him the microphone at that moment to the world and that so that that you know made my spidey sense tingle yeah it's complicated it's the stakes are very high and as somebody that's been obviously family and also reading a lot about world war two yeah and just this whole period is a very difficult conversation but i i i believe in the power especially given who i am of not always but sometimes often turning the other cheek oh yeah and again things change when when they're for public consumption you know when you're so it's like i mean the the the cut for me that you know has just the use case i keep stumbling upon is the the kinds of things that i will say on a podcast like this or if i'm giving a public lecture versus the kinds of things i will say at dinner with strangers or with friends like like if you're in an elevator like if i'm in an elevator with strangers i do not feel and i hear someone say something stupid i don't feel a a an intellectual responsibility to turn around in a in a in a in a con in the confines of that space with them talking about ideas that's when you know there's a different responsibility that comes online the question is how you say it how you say it or even whether you say anything in in those i mean there there are moments there there are definitely moments to privilege civility or just to pick your battles i i mean some sometimes it's just not worth it to get into it with somebody out out in in real life i just believe in the power of empathy both in the in the elevator and when a bunch of people are listening that yeah when they see you willing to consider the another human being's perspective i it just gives more power to your to your words after well yeah but until it doesn't like if you because you can you can right you can extend charity too far right you could like it can be absolutely obvious what someone's motives really are right and they're they're you know dissembling about that right and so then you're taking at face value their representations begins to look like you're just being duped and you're not you're not actually doing the work of of of putting pressure on a bad actor you know so it's it's and again the whole the mental illness component here makes makes it very difficult to think about what you should or shouldn't have said to kanye so i think the topic of platform is is pretty interesting like what's your view on platforming controversial people let's let let's start with the the old would you interview hitler on your podcast and how would you talk to him oh and follow-up question would you interview him in nineteen thirty five forty one and then like forty five well i think we have an uncanny valley problem with respect to this issue of whether or not to speak to bad people right so if if a person is sufficiently bad right if they're all the way out of the the valley then you can talk to them and it's just it's totally unproblematic to talk to them because you don't have to spend any time signaling to your audience that you don't agree with them and if you're interviewing hitler you don't have to say listen i just gotta say before we start i don't agree with the whole you know genocide thing and you know i i just think you're killing you know killing mental patients and vans and all that that was all bad it was a bad look adolf so you you just it can go without saying that you don't agree with this person and you're not platforming them to signal boost their their views you're just trying to if they're sufficiently evil you can go into it very much as an anthropologist would just you just wanna understand the nature of evil right you just wanna understand this phenomenon like how is this person who they are right and that strikes me as a intellectually interesting and and morally necessary thing to do right so yes you i think you always interview hitler wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait well when he when you know once he's hitler but when do you know it once he's legitimately but when do you know it is oh yeah genocide really happening yeah yeah yeah forty two forty three no if if you're on the cusp of it where it's just he's someone who's gaining power and you don't wanna you don't wanna help facilitate that then there's a question of whether you can you can undermine him in while pushing back against him in that interview right so there are people i wouldn't talk to just because i don't wanna give them oxygen and i don't think that in the in the context of my interviewing them i'm gonna be able to to take the wind out of their sails at all right so it's it's like for whatever either because an asymmetric advantage because i just know that they can do something that they they they within the span of an hour that i can't that i can't correct for sure you know it's just like they can they can light many small fires and it just takes too much time to put them out that's more like on the topic of vaccines for example having a debate on the efficacy of vaccines yeah okay it's not that i don't think sunlight is usually the best disinfectant i think it is you know even these asymmetries aside i mean there are there it is true that a a person can always make a mess faster than you can clean it up right but still there are debates worth having even given that limitation and they're the right people to have those specific debates and there's certain topics where you know i'll debate someone just because i'm the right person for the job and it doesn't matter how messy they're gonna be i it's just it's just worth it because i i can make my points land at least to to the right part of the audience so some of it is just your own skill and competence and also interest in preparing correctly well yeah yeah and the nature of the subject matter and and but the yeah but there are other people who just by default i would say well there's no reason to give this guy a platform and there there are also people who are so confabulatory that they're making such a mess with every sentence that you insofar as you're even trying to interact with what they're saying you're going you're by definition going to fail and you're going to seem to fail to an an a sufficiently large uninformed audience where it's gonna be a net negative for for the for the cause of truth no matter how good you are so like for instance i think talking to alex jones on any topic for any reason is probably a bad idea because i just think he's he's just neurologically wired to just i mean utter a string of sentences he'll get twenty sentences out each of which has to be each of which is you know contains more lies than the last and there's just there's not time enough in the world to run down and certainly not time enough in the span of a conversation to run down each of those leads to to bedrock so as to falsify it and they'll just make shit up they just and or and or make shit up and then then then weave it in with with you know half truths and and and micro truths that may give some semblance of credibility to somebody out there i mean apparently millions of people out there and there's just no way to to untangle that in real time with him i have noticed that you have an allergic reaction to confabularization yeah confabulation yeah confabulation yeah that if somebody says something a little micro untruth it really stops your brain here i'm not talking about micro untruths i'm just talking about making up things out of whole cloth so it's like is it if someone says something like well what about and then the then the thing they put at the end of that sentence is just a set of pseudo facts right that you can't possibly authenticate or not in the span of that conversation they will you know whether it's about ufos or anything else right they will seem to make you look like an ignoramus when in fact everything they're saying is specious right whether they know it or not i mean there's some people who are just crazy there's some people who are who are just bullshitting and they're not even tracking whether it's true or just feels good and then some people are consciously lying about things but don't you think there's just a kind of jazz masterpiece of untruth that you should be able to just wave off by saying like well none of that is backed up by any evidence it's just almost like take it to the humor place well you but the thing is is okay just the the place i'm familiar with doing this and not doing this is is on specific conspiracies like nine eleven truth right like the the nine eleven so i because of my because of what nine eleven did to my intellectual life i mean it's really just you know it it sent me down a path for the better part of a decade like i became a critic of religion well i don't know if i was ever gonna be a critic of religion right like but that like it happened to be in my wheelhouse because i spent so much time studying religion on my own and i was also very interested in in the the underlying spiritual concerns of every religion and so i was i was you know i devoted yeah full more more than a full decade of my life to just you know what is what is real here what is possible what is what is the nature of subjective reality and how does it relate to reality at large and is there anything to you know who just who was someone like jesus or buddha and are these people frauds or are they are they are these just these just myths or or or is there really a continuum of of insight to be had here that is interesting so i spent a lot of time on that question through my twin the full decade of my twenties and that was launched in part by nine eleven truther no but then when nine eleven happened i had spent all this time you know reading religious books understand empathically understanding the motivations of religious people right knowing just how fully certain people believe what they say they believe right so i took religious convictions very seriously and then people started flying planes into our buildings and i so i knew that there was something to be said about allegedly the the core doctrines of islam yeah exactly so so i went down so that was that became my wheelhouse for a time you know terrorism and and jihadism and real related topics and so the nine eleven truth conspiracy thing kept you know getting aimed at me and the question was well do i do i wanna debate these people right yeah alex jones perhaps yeah i mean yeah so alex jones i think was an early purveyor of it although i don't think i knew who he was at that point point and so and privately i had some very long debates with people who you know the one person in my family went way down that rabbit hole and i just you know every six months or so i'd literally write the two hour email you know that that would try to try to deprogram him you know however ineffectually and so i went back and forth for years on that topic with with in private with people but i could see the structure of the conspiracy i could see the nature of of of of of of how of how impossible it was to to play whack a mole sufficiently well so as to so as to convince anyone of anything who was who was not seeing the the problematic structure of that way of thinking i mean it's it's not actually a thesis it's a it's a proliferation of anomalies that don't you can't actually connect all the dots that are being pointed to they they don't connect in a coherent way there's they're incompatible theses that are not and and their incompatibility is not being acknowledged but they're they're running this algorithm of things are things are never what they seem there's always malicious conspirators doing things perfectly we see all we see evidence of human incompetence everywhere else mhmm no one can tie their shoes you know expertly anywhere else but over here people are perfectly competent they're perfectly concealing like thousands of people are collaborating you know inexplicably i mean incentivized by what who knows they're they're collaborating to murder thousands of their neighbors and no one is breathing a peep about it no one's getting caught on a on camera no one's and and no one's breathed a word of it to a journalist and so i've i've dealt with that style of thinking and i've i know what it's like to be in the weeds of a conversation like that and and and the person will say okay well but what do you make of the fact that all those f sixteens were flown eight hundred miles out to sea on the morning of nine eleven to do an exercise that hadn't even been scheduled for that day but it was and now all of these are i dimly recall some thesis of that kind but i'm just making these things up now right so like that that detail hadn't even been scheduled for that day it's inexplicably run that day like so what how long would it take to track that down right the idea that this is anomalous like there there was a f f sixteen exercise run on it on and it wasn't even supposed to be been run that day right yeah someone like alex jones their speech pattern is to pack as much of that stuff in as possible at the highest velocity that the person can speak and unless you're knocking down each one of those things to that audience you appear to just be uninformed you appear to just not be you don't wait he he didn't know about the f sixteens yeah sure he he doesn't know about project mockingbird you haven't heard about project mockingbird i just made up project mockingbird i don't know what it is but that's the kind of thing that comes at tumbling out in ex in a conversation like that that's the kind of thing frankly i was worried about in the covid conversation because not that someone like brett would do it consciously but someone like brett is swimming in a sea of misinformation on social living on twitter getting people sending the blog post and the study from from you know the philippines that showed that in this cohort ivermectin did x right and and not like to actually run anything to ground right you have to actually do the work journalistically and scientifically and run it to ground right so for many of the for some of these questions you actually have to be a statistician to say okay they were they used the wrong statistics in this experiment right now yes we could take all the time to do that or we could at every stage along the way in a in in a context where we we have experts we can trust go with ninety with what ninety seven percent of the experts are saying about x about the safety of mrna about the transmissibility of covid about whether to wear masks or not wear masks and i completely agree that that broke down unacceptably in the over the last few years and that but i think that's largely a social media and blogs and and the efforts of podcasters and substack writers were not just a response to that it was a i think it was a it was a symptom of that and a and a cause of that right and i think we're we're living in a an environment where people we basically we we have trained ourselves not to be able to agree about facts on any topic no matter how urgent right what's what's flying in our sky you know what is you know what is what's happening in ukraine is is putin just denazifying ukraine i mean like there are people who we respect who are spending time down that particular rabbit hole like this is this is you know maybe there are a lot of nazis in ukraine and that's the real problem right maybe putin's maybe putin's not the bad actor here right how much time do i have to spend empathizing with putin to the point of thinking well maybe putin's got a point and it's like what about the polonium and the nerve agents and the killing of journalists and the you know navalny and like does that count well no listen i'm not paying so much attention to that because i'm following all these interesting people on twitter and they they give me some pro putin material here and there is a there are some nazis in ukraine it's not like there are no nazis in ukraine how am i gonna wait these things i think people are being driven crazy by twitter yeah but you're you're kinda speaking to conspiracy theories that pollute everything and then you but every every example you gave is kind of a bad faith style of conversation but but it's not necessarily knowingly bad faith by i mean the people the people who are who are worried about ukraine ukrainian nazis to my i mean they're some of the same people they're the same people who are worried about ivermectin got suppressed like ivermectin is really the a panacea but it got suppressed for because no one could make billions on it it's it's it's the same it's literally the it's in many cases the same people and the same efforts to to unearth those facts saying it's very difficult to have conversations with those kinds of people what about conversation with trump himself would you do a podcast with trump no and i and i don't think so i i don't think i'd be learning anything about him it's like with with hitler and i i'm not comparing trump to hitler but clips guy here's your chance yeah you got this one with certain world historical figures i i would just feel like okay this is an opportunity to learn something that i'm not gonna learn i i think trump is among the most superficial people we have ever laid eyes on right like he is he is in public view right and i'm sure i'm sure there's some distance between who he is in private and who he is in public but it's not gonna be the kind of distance that's gonna blow my mind and i think so i think the liability of so i for instance i think joe rogan was very wise not to have trump on his podcast i think all he would have been doing is is he would have put himself in a situation where he couldn't adequately contain the damage trump was doing and he was just gonna make trump seem cool to a whole new you know potentially new cohort of his massive audience right i mean they would have they would have had a lot of laughs trump's funny i mean the entertainment value of things is so influential i mean there was that one debate where trump you know got a massive laugh on the you know his line you know only rosie o'donnell right the truth is we're we're living in a political system where if you can get a big laugh during a political debate you win it doesn't matter who you are like like that's the level of of you know it doesn't matter how uninformed you are it doesn't matter that half the debate was about what the hell we should do about about you know a threat of nuclear war or anything else it's we're monkeys right and we like to laugh well because you brought up joe he's somebody like you i look up to i've learned a lot from him because i think who he is privately as a human being also his he's kind of the voice of curiosity to me he inspired me that so unending open minded curiosity much like you are the voice of reason they recently had a podcast joe had recently had a podcast with jordan peterson and brought you up saying they still have a hope for you mhmm yeah any chance clip yeah any chance do you talk to joe again and reinvigorate your friendship yeah well i reached out to him privately when i saw that did he use the power of love joe knows i i love him and consider him a friend right so there's no there's no issue there he also knows i'll i'll be happy to do his podcast when we get that together you know so there's no i i have got no policy of not talking to joe or not doing his podcast i mean i think we're we got a little sideways along these same lines where you know we've talked about brett and elon and other people it was never to that degree with joe because joe is in a very different lane right he's and consciously so i mean joe is a stand up comic who interviews who just is interested in in everything interviews the widest conceivable variety of people and just lets his interests collide with their expertise or you know lack of expertise i mean he's he's again it's a super wide variety of people he'll talk about anything and he can always pull the rip cord saying you know i don't know what the fuck i'm saying i'm a comic i'm stoned we're we we just drank too much right like like it's it's very entertaining it's all in you know to my eye it's it's all in good faith i think joe is an extraordinarily ethical good person also doesn't use twitter doesn't really use twitter yeah yeah no the the crucial difference though is that because he is an entertainer first i mean i'm not i'm not saying he's not smart and doesn't understand things he he he i mean what what's potentially confusing is he's very smart and he he's also very informed he's he's he his full time job is taught you know when he's not doing stand up or or doing color commentary for the ufc his full time job is talking to lots of very smart people at great length so he's gay he's created you know the the joe rogan university for himself and he's he's gotten a lot of information crammed into his head so it's not that he's uninformed but he can always when he feels that he's uninformed or when it turns out he was wrong about something he can always pull the ripcord and say i i'm just a comic we were stoned it was fun you know don't don't take medical advice from me i don't play a doctor on the internet right i can't quite do that right you can't quite do that we're we're in different lanes i'm not saying you you and i are in exactly the same lane but for much of joe's audience i'm just this establishment shill just banging on about you know the universities and medical journals and and it's not true but that would be the perception and as a counterpoint to a lot of what's being said on joe's podcast or or you know certainly brett's podcast on these topics i can see how they they would form that opinion but in reality if you listen to me long enough you hear that i've said as much against the woke nonsense as anyone even any lunatic on the right who's could only keep that bright shine that bright shining object in view right so there's nothing that candace owens has said about wokeness that i haven't said about wokeness as far insofar as she's speaking rationally about wokeness but we have to be able to keep multiple things in view right if you if you could only look at the problem of wokeness and you couldn't acknowledge the problem of trump and trumpism and qanon and and the explosion of irrationality that was happening on the right and bigotry that was happening on the right you just get you were just disregarding half of the landscape and many people took half of the problem in recent years the last five years is a story of many people taking half of the problem and monetizing that half of the problem and getting captured by an an audience that only wanted that half of the problem talked about in that way and this is the this is the larger issue of of audience capture which you know is very i'm sure it's it's an ancient problem but it's a very helpful phrase that i think comes to us courtesy of our mutual friend eric weinstein and audience capture is a thing and i believe i've witnessed many you know casualties of it and if there's anything i've been on guard against in my life you know professionally it's been that and and when i noticed that i had a lot of people in my audience who didn't like my criticizing trump i really leaned into it and when i noticed that a lot of the other cohort in my audience didn't didn't like me criticizing the far left and wokeness they thought i was you know exaggerating that problem mhmm i leaned into it because i thought those parts of my audience were were absolutely wrong and i didn't care about whether i was gonna lose those parts of my audience there are there are people who have created you know knowingly or not there are people who have created different incentives for themselves because of how they they've monetized their podcast and because of the kind of signal they've responded to in their audience and i and i worry about you know you know brett would consider this a totally invidious ad hominem thing to say but i really do worry that that's happened to brett i think i think i i cannot explain how you do a hundred with all the things in the in the universe to be interested in and of all the things he's competent to speak intelligently about i don't know how you do a hundred podcasts in a row on on covid right it's just it makes no sense you think in part audience capture can explain that i absolutely think it can yeah what about do you like for example do you feel pressure to not admit that you made a mistake on covid or made a mistake on trump i'm not saying you feel that way but do you feel this pressure so you've attacked audience capture within your within the way you do stuff so you don't feel as much pressure from the audience but within your own ego i mean again the the people who think i'm wrong about any of these topics are gonna think okay you're just not admitting that you're wrong but then now we're having a dispute about specific facts there are there are things that i believed about covid or worried might very might be true about covid two years ago that i no longer believe or i'm not so worried about now and and vice versa i mean like things have flipped certain things have flipped upside down the question is was i wrong so here's a here's a cartoon version of it but this is something i said probably eighteen months ago and it's still true you know when i saw what brett was doing on covid you know let's call it two years ago i i i said even if he is right even if he turned if even it turns out that ivermectin is a panacea and the mrna vaccines kill millions of people right he's still wrong right now his reasoning is still flawed right now his facts still suck right now right and his and his confidence is is unjustified now that was true then that will always be true then right and and and so and not much has changed for me to to revisit any of my time points along the way again i will totally concede that if i had teenage boys and their and their schools were demanding that they'd be vaccinated with the mrna vaccine i would i would be powerfully annoyed right like i would i wouldn't know what i was gonna do and i would be i would be doing more research about about myocarditis and i'd be badgering our doctors and i would be worried that we have a medical system and a pharmaceutical system and a health care system and a public health system that's not incentivized to to look at any of this in a fine grain way and they just want one blanket admonition to the entire population just get just take the shot you idiots i view that largely as a result of panic response to the misinformation explosion that happened and the and the public the populist resistance animated by misinformation that just made it impossible to get anyone to to cooperate right so it's just part of it is again a pendulum swing in the wrong direction somewhat analogous to the woke response to trump and the trumpist response to woke right so there's a lot of people have just gotten pushed around for bad reasons or but understandable reasons but yes it's there are there are caveats to my things have changed about my view of of covid but the question is if you roll back the clock eighteen months was i wrong to want to platform eric topol you know a a very well respected cardiologist on this topic or you know nicholas christakis to to talk about the network effects of you know the you know whether we close schools right he's written a book on covid he's you know network effects are his wheelhouse as a both as an md and as a a sociologist there was a lot that we believed we knew about the efficacy of of closing schools during pandemics right during the you know during the the spanish flu pandemic and others right but there's a lot we didn't know about covid we didn't know we didn't know how negligible the effects would be on kids compared to older people we didn't know like the well my my problem i really enjoyed your conversation with eric topo but also didn't so he's one of the great communicators in many ways on twitter like distillation of the current data but he i hope i'm not overstating it but there is a bit of an arrogance from him that i think could be explained by him being exhausted by being constantly attacked by conspiracy theory like anti vaxxers yeah to me the same thing happens with people that start drifting to be being right wing is to get attacked so much by the left they become almost irrational and arrogant in their beliefs and i i felt your conversation with eric topol did not sufficiently empathize with people that have skepticism but also did not sufficiently communicate uncertainty we have so like many of the decisions you made many of the things you were talking about we're kinda saying there's a lot of uncertainty but this is the best thing we could do now well it was a forced choice you're gonna get covid do you wanna be vaccinated when you get it right that was always in my view an easy choice and it's up until you you start breaking apart the cohorts and you start saying okay wait a minute there is this myocarditis issue in in young men let's talk about that when that's before that story emerged it was just it was just clear that this is if it's not if it's not knocking down transmission as much as we had hoped it is still mitigating severe illness and death and i i i still believe that it is the the current view of the of most people competent to analyze the data that we lost something like three hundred thousand people unnecessarily in the us because of because of vaccine hesitancy but i think there's a way to communicate with humility about the uncertainty of things that would increase the vaccination rate i i do believe that it is rational and sometimes effective to to signal impatience with certain bad ideas right and certain conspiracy theories and certain forms of misinformation you think so it because it's just i just think it makes you look a douchebag most times well no i mean certain people are persuadable certain people are not persuadable but it's no because there's not enough it's it's the opportunity cost not everything can be given a patient hearing so you can't have a physics conference and then let people in to just trumpet their pet theories about you know the grand unified vision of physics when they're obviously crazy or they're obviously half crazy or they're just not or you know the the people like you begin to you begin to get a sense for this when it is your wheelhouse but there are people who could declare their their irrelevance to the conversation fairly quickly without knowing that they have done it right and and the truth is i think i'm one of those people on the topic of covid right like i it's like it's not it's never that i felt listen i know exactly what's going on here i know these mrna vaccines are safe i know exact i know i know exactly how to run a lockdown i know this is this is a situation where you want the actual pilots to fly the plane right we needed experts who we could trust and insofar as our experts got captured by by all manner of things i mean some of them got captured by trump some of them were made to look ridiculous just standing next to trump while he was bloviating about you know whatever that you know that it's just gonna go away there's just fifteen people you know there's fifteen people in a cruise ship and it's just gonna go away there's gonna be no problem or it's like when he said he you know many of these doctors think i understand this better than them they're just amazed at how i understand this and you've got doctors real doctors the heads of the cdc and and nih standing around just ashen faced while he's talking you know all of this was deeply corrupting of the public communication of science on bull and then again i've banged on about the depredations of wokeness the woke thing was a disaster right still is a disaster but it doesn't mean that i mean but the thing is there's a big difference between me and brett in this case i didn't do a hundred podcasts on covid i did like two podcasts on covid the measure of my concern about covid can be measured in how many podcasts i did on it right it's like once we had a sense of how to live with covid i was just living with covid right like okay get vaxxed or don't get vaxxed wear a mask or don't wear a mask travel or don't travel like you've got a few things to decide but my kids were stuck at home on ipads you know for too long i didn't agree with that you know it was obviously not functional like i criticize that on the margins but there was not much to do about it but the the the thing i didn't do is make this my life and just browbeat people with one message or another we need a public health regime where we can trust what competent people are saying to us about you know what medicines are safe to take and in the absence of that craziness is gonna even in the presence of that craziness is gonna proliferate given the tools we've built but in the absence of that it it's gonna proliferate for understandable reasons and that's gonna it's it's not gonna be good next time when when something orders of magnitude more dangerous hits us and that and that's i spent a you know insofar as i think about this issue i think much more about next time than this time before this covid thing you and brad had some good conversations i would say we're friends what's your what do you admire most about brad outside of all the criticism we've had about this covid topic well i i think brett is very smart and he's a very ethical person who wants good things for the world i mean i have no reason to doubt that so the fact that we're on you know we're crosswise on this issue is not does not mean that i think he's a bad person i mean the the thing that worried me about what he was doing and this was true of joe and this was true of elon this is true of many other people is that once you're messaging at scale to a vast audience you incur a certain kind of responsibility not to to get people killed and i i do i did worry that yeah people were people were making decisions on the basis of the information that was getting shared there and that that's why i was i think fairly circumspect i just said okay give me the the center of the fairway expert opinion at this time point and at this time point and at this time point and then i'm out right i don't have any more to say about this i'm not an expert on covid i'm not an expert on the safety of mrna vaccines if something if something changes so as to become news worthy then maybe i'll do a pod so i mean i just did a podcast on the lab leak lab leak right i was never skeptical of the lab leak hypothesis brett was very early on saying this is this is a lab leak right at a point where my only position was who cares if it's a lab leak right like this there's the thing we have to get straight is what do we do given the nature of this pandemic but also we should say that you've actually stated that it is a possibility oh yeah you just said it doesn't doesn't quite matter i mean it the time to figure that out now i've actually i have had my my podcast guest on this topic changed my view of this because you know one of the guests elena chan made the point that no actually the the best time to figure out the origin of this is immediately right because in the you lose touch with the evidence and i hadn't really been thinking about that like i didn't if you come back after a year you know there are certain facts you might not be able to get in hand but i've always felt that it didn't matter for two reasons one is we had the genome of the virus and and we could design we very quickly design immediately designing vaccines against that genome and that's what we had to do and then we had to figure out how to vaccinate and to and to mitigate and to develop treatments and all of that so the origin story didn't matter generically speaking either origin story was politically inflammatory and made the chinese look bad right and the chinese response to this looked bad whatever the origin story right they're not cooperating they're letting they're they're stopping their domestic flights but letting their international flights go i mean it's just they were bad actors and they should be treated as such regardless of the origin right and you know i would argue that the wet market origin is even more politically invidious than the lab leak origin i mean why do you think because for lab leak to my eye the lab leak can happen to anyone right we're all run all these advanced countries are running these dangerous labs that's a practice that we should be worried about you know in general we know lab leaks are a problem there have been multiple lab leaks of even worse things that that haven't gotten out of hand in this way but you know worse pathogens we're we're wise to be worried about this and on some level it could happen to anyone right the wet market makes them look like barbarians within another century like you gotta clean up those wet markets like what are you what are you doing putting a bat on top of a pangolin on top of a duck it's like get your shit together so like if anything the wet market makes them look worse in my view now i'm sure there's i'm sure that what they actually did to conceal a lab leak if it was a lab leak i mean all of that's gonna look odious do you think we'll ever get to the bottom of that i mean one of the big negative i would say failures of antheology and so on is to be transparent and clear and just a good communicator about gain and functional research the dangers of that the success like the you know why it's a useful way of research but it's also dangerous right you know just being transparent about that as opposed to just coming off really shady of course the conspiracy theorists and the the politicians are not helping but this just created a giant mess yeah no i would agree that so so that exchange with fauci and rand paul they went viral yeah i would agree that fauci looked like he was taking refuge in kind of very lawyered language and not giving a straightforward account of what we do and why we do it and so yeah i think it it looked shady it played shady and it probably was shady i mean i don't i don't know how personally entangled he is with any of this but yeah the the gain of function research is something that i think we're wise to be worried about and insofar as i judge myself adequate to have an opinion on this i think it should be banned right like i i i'm probably a podcast i'll do you know if you or somebody else doesn't do it in the meantime you know i i would like a virologist on to defend it against a virologist who who who would criticize it forget about just the gain of function research i don't even understand virus hunting at this point mhmm it's like i don't know i don't even know why you need to go into a cave to find this next virus that could be circulating among bats that may jump zoonotically to us why do that when we can make when we when we can sequence in a day and and make vaccines in a in a weekend i mean like like what what kind of head start do you think you're getting that's a surprising new thing how quickly you can develop a vaccine exactly that's yeah that's that's really interesting but the shadiness around lab leak the i think the point i didn't make about brett's style of engaging this issue is people are using the fact that he was early on lab leak to suggest that he was right about ivermectin and about mrna vaccines and all the rest like no that that that's none of that connects and it was possible to be falsely confident like you shouldn't have been confident about lab no one should have been confident about lab leak early even if it turns out to be lab leak right it was always plausible it was never definite it still isn't definite zoonotic is is is also quite plausible it certainly was super plausible then both are politically uncomfortable both were both at the time were inflammatory to be banging on about when we were trying to secure some kind of cooperation from the chinese right so there's a time for these things and and and it's possible to be right by accident right that's the that is it your your reasoning the style of reasoning matters whether you're right or not you know it's like because your style of reasoning is dictating what you're gonna do on the next topic sure but this is this multivariate situation here it's it's really difficult to know what's right on covid given all the uncertainty all the chaos especially when you step outside the pure biology virology of it and you start to get into policy it's it's really yeah it's just trade offs yeah like transmissibility of the virus sure just knowing if sixty five percent of the population gets vaccinated what effect would that have just even knowing those things just modeling all those things given all the other incentives i mean pfizer but you had you had the ceo of pfizer on your podcast did you leave that conversation feeling like this is a person who is consciously reaping windfall profits on a dangerous vaccine and putting everyone at intolerable risk or do you think this person did you think this person was making a good faith attempt to save lives and had no no bad no no taint of bad incentives or something between the thing i sensed and i felt in part it was a failure on my part but i i sensed that i was talking to a politician mhmm so it's not thinking of there was malevolence there or benevolence there was he just had a job he he put on a suit and i was talking to a suit not a human being now he said that his son was a big fan of the podcast which is why he wanted to do it so i thought i will be talking to a human being and i asked challenging questions but i thought the internet thinks otherwise every single question in that interview was a challenging one mhmm but it wasn't grilling which is what people seem to want to do with pharmaceutical companies there's a deep distrust of pharmaceutical companies but what what's the alternative i mean i i i totally get right that's just windfall profits at a time of of you know public health emergency looks bad it's a bad it is a bad look right but yeah what do how do we reward and return capital to to to risk takers who are who will spend a billion dollars to design a new drug for a disease that may maybe only harms you know a single digit percentage of the population it's like well what do we wanna encourage and and who do we want to get rich i i mean so like the person who cures cancer do we want that person to get rich or not we we want the we want the person who gave us the iphone to get rich but we don't want the person who who cures cancer to get rich i mean what what are we trying to do a very gray area so what we want is the person who declares that they have a cure for cancer to have authenticity and transparency there's like i think we're good now as a population smelling bullshit and there is something about the the pfizer ceo for example just ceos of pharmaceutical companies in general just because they're so lawyered up so much marketing and pr people that they're you just smell bullshit you're not talking to real human that it they just it just feels like none of it is transparent to us as a public so like this whole talking point that pfizer's only interested in helping people just doesn't ring true even though it very well could be true it's the same thing with bill gates who seems to be at scale helping a huge amount of people in the world yeah and yet there's something about the way he delivers that message where people like this seems suspicious what's happening underneath this right there's certain kinds of communication styles that seem to be more serve as better catalyst for conspiracy theories and i'm not sure what what that is because i don't think there's an alternative for capitalism in delivering drugs that help people but also at the same time there seems to need to be a more transparency and plus like regulation that actually makes sense versus mhmm it seems like pharmaceutical companies are susceptible to corruption yeah i i i worry about all that but i i also do think that most of the people going into those fields and most of the people going into government yeah they wanna do good doing it for good and they're non psychopaths trying to get good things done and try trying to solve hard problems and they they're not trying to get rich i mean many of the people are it's like they're bad incentives are are something again i've i've i've i've uttered that phrase thirty times on this podcast but it's it's just almost everywhere it explains normal people creating terrible harm right it's not that there are that many bad people and yes it makes it makes the truly bad people that much more remarkable and and worth paying attention to but the bad incentives and and the bad and the and the the the power of bad ideas do do much more harm because i mean that's what that what that's what gets good people running in the wrong direction or or doing things that are that are clearly creating unnecessary suffering you've had and i hope still have a friendship with elon musk especially over the topic of ai you have a lot of interesting ideas that you both share concerns you both share well let me first ask what do you admire most about elon well i you know i had a lot of fun with elon i i like elon a lot i mean elon i i knew as a friend i i like a lot and you know you know it's it's not gonna surprise anyone i mean he's he's done and he's continuing to do amazing things and i think he's you know i think many of his aspirations are realized the world would be a much better place i think it's it's just it's amazing to see what he's built and what he's attempted to build and what he may have built and so with tesla with spacex with yeah no i'm i'm a fan of almost all of that i mean there are there are wrinkles to to a lot of that you know or some of that all humans are full of wrinkles there's something very trumpian about how he's acting on twitter i mean twitter i think twitter's he doesn't he thinks twitter's great he bought the place because he thinks it's so great i think twitter's driving him crazy right i think he's i think he's needlessly complicating his life and harming his reputation and creating a lot of noise and and harming a lot of other people i mean so like he the thing that i objected to with him on twitter is not that he bought it and made changes to it i mean that was not again i i i remain agnostic as to whether or not he can improve the platform it was how he was personally behaving on twitter not just toward me but toward the world i think when you you know forward an article about nancy pelosi's husband being attacked not as he was by some lunatic but that it's just some gay gay tryst gone awry right that's not what it seems and you link to a a website that previously claimed that hillary clinton was dead and that a body double was campaigning in her place that thing was exploding in trumpistan as a conspiracy theory right and it was having its effect and it matters that he was signal boosting it in front of a hundred and thirty million people and so it is with saying that your you know your your former employee yoel roth is a pedophile right i mean it's like that has real consequences it appeared to be complete bullshit and now you this guy is getting inundated with death threats right and elon it's all that's totally predictable right and he's so he's behaving quite recklessly and there's a long list of things like the like that that he's done on twitter it's not ethical it's not good for him it's not good for the world it's not serious it's just it's it's it's a very adolescent relationship to real problems in our society and so my my problem with how he's behaved is that he's he's purported to touch real issues by turns like okay do i give the satellites to ukraine or not do i do i minimize their use of them or not is this should i publicly worry about world war three or not right he's doing this shit on twitter right and at the same moment he's doing these other very impulsive ill considered things and he's not showing any willingness to really clean up the mess he makes he brings kanye on knowing he's an anti semite who's got mental health problems and then kicks him off for a swastika which i probably wouldn't have kicked him off for a swastika it's like that's that's even like can you really kick people off for swastikas is that something that you you you get banned for i mean that are you a free speech absolutist if you can't let a swath sticker show up i'm not even sure that's enforce an enforceable terms of service right there's there are way there are moments to use swot stickers that are not conveying hate and not raising the risk of violence clip that yeah any but so much of what he's doing given that he's again scale matters he's doing this in front of a hundred and thirty million people that's very different than a million people and that's very different than a hundred thousand people and so and so when i went off the tracks with elon he was doing this about covid and again this was a situation where i tried to privately mitigate a friend's behavior and it didn't work out very well did you try to correct him sort of highlighting things he might be wrong on yeah or did you use the lex power love method i should i should write like a pamphlet for sam harris to call but it it was it was totally coming from a place of love because i was concerned about his reputation i was concerned about what he i mean there was a twofold concern i could see what was happening with the tweet i mean he'd he'd had this original tweet that was i think it was panic panic over covid is dumb or something like that right this is wait this is in march this is early march twenty twenty oh super early days super early so when nobody knew anything but we knew we saw what was happening in italy right it was totally kicking off god that was a wild time that's when the toilet paper it was totally wild but that became the most influential tweet on twitter for that week i mean it had more engagement than any other tweet more than any crazy thing trump was tweeting i mean it was it went off again it was just a nuclear bomb of of information and i could see that people were responding to it like wait a minute okay here's this genius technologist who must have inside information about everything right surely he knows something that is not on the surface about this pandemic and they're reading they were reading into it a lot of information that i knew wasn't there right and i and i at the at the time i didn't even i didn't think he had any reason to be suggesting that i think he was just firing off a tweet right so i reached out to him in private and i mean because it was a private text conversation i i won't talk about the details but i'm just saying that's a case you know among the men the many cases of friends who have public platforms and who did something that i thought was dangerous and ill considered this was a case where i i reached out in private and tried to to help genuinely help because it was just i thought it was harmful in in every sense because it was being misinterpreted and it's like oh okay you can say that panic over anything is dumb fine but this was not the how this was landing this was like nonissue conspiracy there's gonna be no covid in the us it's gonna peter out it's just gonna become a cold i mean that that's how this was getting received whereas at that moment it was absolutely obvious how big a deal this was gonna be now or that it was gonna at minimum going to be a big deal i don't know if it was obvious but it was it was obvious there was a a significant probability that it could be a big i remember in mark it was unclear like how big because there's still stories of it like it's probably going to like the big concern the hospitals might overfill but it's gonna die again in like two months or something yeah we didn't know but it was there was no way we weren't going to have tens of thousands of deaths at a minimum at that point and and it was and it was every it was totally rational to be worried about hundreds of thousands and when nicholas christakis came on my podcast very early you know he predicted quite confidently that we would have about a million people dead in the us right and that didn't seem you know it was it was you know i think appropriately hedged but i mean it was still it was just like okay it's just gonna you just look at the you we we're just kinda riding this exponential and we're and it's gonna be you know it'd be very surprising not to have that order of magnitude and not something much much less and so anyway i mean to again to to close the the story on elon i could see how this was being received and i tried to get him to walk that back and then we we had a fairly long and detailed exchange on this issue and that so that intervention didn't work and it was not done you know i was not an asshole i was not i was just concerned you know for him for the world for and you know and then there are other relationships where i didn't take the again that's an example where taking the time didn't work right privately there are other relations where i thought okay this is gonna be more trouble than it's worth and i said i just just ignored it you know and there's a lot of that and it's i and i frank again i'm not comfortable with how this is all netted out because i i i don't know if you know and i'm i'm not you know frankly i'm not comfortable with how much time in this conversation brett or any i think there's a lot of good because those friendships listen as a fan these are the conversations that i i loved love as a fan and it feels like covid has robbed the world of these conversations because you were exchanging back and forth on twitter but that's not what i mean by conversations like long form discussions like a debate about covid like a normal debate but there's no there is no elon and i shouldn't be debating covid you should be here's the thing with humility like basically saying we don't really know like the rogen method right we don't i don't we're just a bunch of idiots like one is an engineer you're a neuroscientist but like it it just kinda okay here's the evidence and be like normal people that's what everybody was doing the whole world was like trying to figure out what the hell what yeah but the issue was that at that so at the moment i had this collision with elon certain things were not debatable right it was just it was absolutely clear where this was going it wasn't clear how far it was gonna go or how quickly we would mitigate it but it was absolutely clear that it was gonna be an issue right the the the the train had come off the tracks in italy we knew we weren't gonna seal our borders there were already people you know who there are there are already cases known to many of us personally in the us at that point and he was operating by a very different logic that i couldn't engage with sure but that logic represents a part of the population and there's a lot of interesting topics that have a lot of uncertainty around them like the effectiveness of masks like yeah but no but where things broke down was not at the point of oh there's a lot to talk about a lot to debate this is all very interesting and who knows what's what it broke down very early at this is you know we there's nothing to talk about here i get like it's like either there's a water bottle on the table or there isn't right like it well technically there's only one fourth of of a water bottle right yeah so what what defines a water bottle is it the water inside the water bottle or is it the water bottle what i'm giving you is an example of it's worth a conversation this is difficult because this is we had an exchange in private and i want to sure sure i wanna honor not not exposing the the details of it but you know the details convinced me that there was not a follow-up conversation on that topic on this topic yeah that said i hope and i hope to be part of helping that happen that the friendship is rekindled because one of the topics i care a lot about artificial intelligence you're you've had great public and private conversations about this topic and yes and elon was very formative in my taking that issue seriously i mean he he and i went to that initial conference in puerto rico together and it was only because he was going and i found out about it through him and i just rode his coattails to it you know that i that i got dropped in that side of the pool to hear about these concerns at that point it it'd be interesting to hear how has your conserved concern evolved with the coming out of chad gpt and these new large language models that are fine tuned with reinforcement learning and seemingly to be able to do some incredible human like things there's two questions one how has your concern in terms of agi and superintelligence evolved mhmm and how impressed are you with chi gpt as a as a student of the human mind and mind in general well my concern about agi is unchanged so i am i did a i've i've spoken about it a bunch on my podcast but you know i did a ted talk in twenty sixteen which was the the kinda summary of what that conference and and you know various conversations i had after that did to my my brain on on this topic basically that once superintelligence is achieved there's a takeoff it becomes exponentially smarter and in a matter of time they're just we're ants and they're gods well yeah and unless we find some way of permanently tethering a a self a a a super intelligent super intelligent self improving ai to our value system and i you know i i don't believe anyone has figured out how to do that or whether that's even possible in principle i mean i know people like stuart russell who i just had on my podcast are oh really have you been have you released it haven't released it yet yeah oh great he he's been on previous podcast but we just recorded this week because you haven't done an ai podcast in a while so it's great yeah so i just he's a good person to talk about alignment with yeah so stewart i mean stewart is has been you know probably more than anyone my guru on this topic i mean like you're just reading his book and and doing i think i've done two podcasts with him at this point i think it's called the the control problem or something like that his is his book is human compatible human compatible yeah he talks about the control problem and yeah so i just think the the idea that we can define a value function in advance that permanently tethers a a self improving superintelligent ai to our values as we continue to discover them refine them extrapolate them in an open ended way i think that's a tall order and there i think there are many more ways there must be many more ways of designing superintelligence that is not aligned in that way and is not ever approximating our values in that way so i mean stewart's idea to put it in a very simple way is that he thinks you don't wanna specify the value function upfront you don't you don't wanna imagine you could ever write the code in such a way as to admit of no loophole you want to make the ai uncertain as to what human values are and perpetually uncertain and always trying to ameliorate that uncertainty by by hewing more and more closely to what our professed values are so like just it's always interested in saying oh no no that's not what we want that's not what we intend stop doing that right no matter how smart it gets all it wants to do is more perfectly approximate human values i think there are a lot of problems with that you know at a high level i'm not a computer scientist so i'm sure there are many problems at a low level that i don't understand or like how to force a human into the loop always no matter what there's that and like what humans get a vote and just just what is you know what what do humans value and what is the difference between what we say we value and our revealed preferences which i mean if you just if you were a super intelligent ai that could look at humanity now i think you could be forgiven for concluding that what we value is driving ourselves crazy with twitter and living perpetually on the brink of nuclear war and you know just watching you know hot girls in yoga pants on tiktok again and again and again it's like what you're saying that is not this is this is this is all revealed preference and it's what is an ai to make of that or like what and what should it optimize like so a part of the this is also stewart's observation that one of the insidious things about like the youtube algorithm is it it's not that it just caters to our preferences it actually begins to change us in ways so as to make us more predictable if i could find ways to make us a better reporter of our of our preferences and to trim our preferences down so that it can can further train to that signal so the main concern is that most of the people in the field seem not to be taking intelligence seriously like you yeah as as they design more and more intelligent machines and as they profess to want to design true agi they're not again they're they're not spending the time that stewart is spending trying to figure out how to do this safely above all they're just assuming that these these problems are gonna solve themselves as we as we make that final stride into the end zone or they're saying very you know pollyanna ish things like you know an ai would never form a motive to harm human like why would it ever form a motive to to to be malicious toward humanity right unless we put that motive in there right and that's that's not the concern the concern is that in the presence of of vast disparities in competence and in certainly in a condition where these the machines are improving themselves they're improving their own code they could be developing goal instrumental goals that are antithetical to our well-being without any without any intent to harm us right it's it's it's analogous to what we do to every other species on earth i mean you and i don't consciously form the intention to harm insects on a daily basis but there are many things we could intend to do that would in fact harm insects because you know you decide to repave your driveway or whatever whatever you're doing you're like you're not you're just not taking the the interest of insects into account because they're so far beneath you in terms of your cognitive horizons and the so that the real challenge here is that if you believe that intelligence you know scales up on a continuum to toward heights that we can only dimly imagine and i think there's every reason to believe that there's no reason to believe that we're near the summit of intelligence and you can define you know define maybe maybe there's maybe there's some forms of intelligence for which this is not true but for for many relevant forms you know like the top hundred things we care about cognitively i think there's every reason to believe that many of those things most of those things are a lot like chess or go where once the machines get better than we are they're gonna stay better than we are although they're i don't know if you caught the recent thing with go where where and this actually came out of stuart's lab one yeah yeah one one time a human beat a machine yeah they they found a hack for that but anyway in the ultimately it's there's gonna be no looking back and then the question is what do you what do we do in relate in relationship to these systems that are more competent than we are in every relevant respect because it will be a relationship it's not like the peep the people who think we're just gonna figure this all out you know without thinking about it in advance it's just gonna these the solutions are just gonna find themselves seem not to be taking the prospect of really creating autonomous superintelligence seriously like like what does that mean it it's every bit as independent and ungovernable ultimately as us having created i mean just imagine if we created a race of people that were ten times smarter than all of us like how would we live with those people they're ten times smarter than us right like they begin to talk about things we don't understand they begin to want things we don't understand they begin to view us as obstacles to them that they're solving those problems or gratifying those desires we become the chickens or the monkeys in in their presence and i i think that it's but for some amazing solution of the sort that stewart is is imagining that we could somehow anchor their reward function permanently no matter how intelligent scales i think it's it's really worth worrying about this i do i do i do buy the the you know the sci fi notion that this is an existential risk if we don't do it well i worry that we don't notice it i'm i'm deeply impressed with chargegpt and i'm worried that it will become super intelligent these language models have become super intelligent because they're basically trained in the collective intelligence of the human species and then it'll start controlling our behavior if they're integrated into our algorithms the recommender systems and then we just won't notice that there is a superintelligence system that's controlling our behavior well i i think that's true even before far before superintelligence even before general intelligence i mean i i think just the narrow intelligence of these algorithms and of what something like you know chat g p t can can do i mean it's just far short of it developing its own goals and that that is that are at cross purposes with ours just the just the unintended consequences of of using it in the ways we're going to be incentivized to use it and and you know the the money to be made from scaling this thing and what it does to to our information space and our sense of of just being able to get the ground truth of of on any facts it's yeah it's it's super scary and it was it's do you think it's a giant leap in terms of the development towards agi chi gpt or we still is this just an impressive little toolbox so like when when do you think the singularity is coming or do or or is it to you it doesn't matter i i i have no intuitions on that front apart from the fact that if we continue to make progress it will come right so it's just you just have to assume we continue to make progress there's only two assumptions you you you have to assume substrate independence so there's there's no reason why this can't be done in silico it's just it's it's just we can build arbitrarily intelligent machines there's nothing magical about having a having this done in in the wetware of our own brains i think that is true and i think that's you know scientifically parsimonious to think that that's true and then you just have to assume we're gonna keep making progress it doesn't have to be any special rate of progress it doesn't have to be moore's law can just be we just keep going at a certain point we're gonna be in relationship to minds leaving consciousness consciousness aside i i i don't i don't have any reason to believe that they'll necessarily be conscious by virtue of being super intelligent and that's its own interesting ethical question but leaving consciousness aside they're gonna be more they're gonna be more competent than we are and then that's like you know the the aliens have landed you know that's literally that's an encounter with again leaving aside the possibility that that something like stewart's path is is is actually available to us but it it is hard to picture if what we mean by intelligence all things considered and is truly general if that scales and you know begins to build upon itself how you maintain that perfect slavish devotion until the end of time the tether in those systems the tether to humans yeah i think my gut says that that tether is not there's a lot of ways to do it so it's not this increasingly impossible problem right so i so i have no you know you know as you know i'm not a computer scientist so i have no intuitions about just algorithmically how you would approach that and and what's somewhat possible my main intuition is is maybe deeply flawed but the main intuition is based on the fact that most of the learning is currently happening on human knowledge so even chat g p t is just trained on human data right i i don't see where the takeoff happens where you completely go above human wisdom the current impressive aspect of chat gbt is that's using collective intelligence of all of us well from what what i glean from again from people who know much more about this than i do i i think we have reason to be skeptical that these tech techniques of you know deep learning are actually going to be sufficient to push us into agi right so it's just not they're not they're not generalizing in the way they need to they're not certainly not learning like human children and so they're they're they're there's brittle and strange ways they're they're it's not to say that they the human path is the only path you know and you know and maybe there's we we might learn better lessons by ignoring the way brains work but we know that they don't generalize and use abstraction the way we do and so although the instinct strange holes in their competence but the size of the holes is shrinking every time and that's yeah so the intuition starts to slowly fall apart you know the intuition is like surely it can't be this simple to achieve superintelligence yeah but it's becoming simpler and simpler so i don't know i i don't the progress is quite incredible i've been extremely impressed with jagpt and the new models and there's a lot of financial incentive to make progress in this regard so so it's we're going to be living through some very interesting times in raising a question that i'm going to be talking to you a lot of people brought up this topic probably because eric weinstein talked to joe rogan recently and said that he and you were contacted by folks about ufos mhmm can you clarify the nature of this contact can you can you yeah yeah that you will contact about i've got very little to say on this i mean he has much more to say i think he i think he went down this rabbit hole further than than i did which which wouldn't surprise anyone he's got much more of a taste for this sort of thing than i do but i think we're contacted by the same person it wasn't clear to me who this person was or how this person got my cell phone number they didn't seem it didn't seem like we were getting punked i mean it's the person seemed credible to me and they were talking to you about the release of different videos on ufo yeah and this this is when there was a flurry of activity around this so there was like a there was a big new yorker article on on ufos and there was there was rumors of congressional hearings i think coming in and and then with the the the videos that were being debunked or not and so this person contacted both of us i think around the same time and i think he might have contacted rogan or other eric is just the only person i've spoken to about it i think who i know was contacted and the what happened is the person kept you know writing a check that he didn't cash like he he kept saying okay next week i'm gonna you know i understand this is sounding spooky and you know you have no reason to really trust me but next week i'm gonna i'm gonna put you on a zoom call with people who you will recognize and they're gonna be you know former heads of the cia and you know peep people who just you're gonna within five seconds of being on the zoom call you'll you'll know this is not a hoax so great just let me know just send me the zoom link right and i went that happened maybe three times you know and but it there was just one phone conversation and then it was just texts you know there's just a bunch of texts and i think eric spent more time with this person and i'm not i haven't spoken to him about it i know he's spoke about it publicly but so i i you know it's not that my bullshit detector ever really went off in a big way it's just the thing never happened and i so i i lost interest so you you've made a comment which is interesting that you ran the which i really appreciate you ran a thought experiment of saying okay maybe we do have alien spacecraft or it's just a thought experiment the aliens did visit yeah and then this is a very kinda nihilistic sad thought that it wouldn't matter it wouldn't affect your life can can you can you explain that well no i i always i think many people notice this i mean this was a a sign of how crazy the news cycle was at that point right it's like we had covid and we had trump and i forget when this the ufo thing was really kicking off but it just seemed like no one had the bandwidth to even be interested in this it's like i i i was amazed to notice in myself that i wasn't more interested in figuring out what was going on it's like and and i i considered okay wait a minute this is if this is true this is the biggest story in anyone's lifetime i mean contact with alien intelligence is by definition the biggest story in anyone's lifetime in in human history why isn't this just totally captivating and it not only was it not totally captivating it was just barely rising to the level of my being able to pay attention to it and i i view that i mean one as a to some degree a an understandable defense mechanism against the the the the bogus claims that yeah that have been made about this kind of thing in the past you know the the general sense is probably bullshit or it probably has some explanation that is you know purely terrestrial and not surprising and there was there's there is somebody who what's his name is it mick west i forget is it a youtuber yeah yeah he debunked stuff yeah he don't he i mean i you know i i have since seen some of those videos i mean now now this is going back still at least a year but some of those videos seem like fairly credible debunkings of some of the the optical evidence and i'm surprised we don't haven't seen more of that like there was a a fairly credulous sixty minutes piece that came out around that time looking at some of that video and it was the very video that he was debunking on youtube and you know his his video only had like fifty thousand views on it or whatever but again it seemed like a fairly credible debunking i haven't seen debunkings of his debunkings but so i think there is but he's basically saying that there is there is possible explanations for it right and usually in these kinds of contexts if there's a possible explanation even if it seems unlikely is going to be more likely than an alien civilization visiting us yeah it's the extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence principle which i i think is generally true well with aliens i think generally i think there should be some humility about what they would look like when they show up but i tend to think they're already here the amazing thing about this ai conversation though is that we're talking about a circumstance where we would be designing the aliens yeah and they would and there's every reason to believe that eventually this is gonna happen like i said i'm not at all skeptical about the the coming reality of the aliens that we're gonna build them now here's the thing does this apply to when superintelligence shows up will this be trending on twitter for a day and they would go on to complain about something sam harris once again said on his podcast next day you you tend to tend trend on twitter even though you're not on twitter which is great yeah i don't i haven't noticed i mean i i did i did notice when i was on but did you have this concern about agi basically same kind of thing that we would just look the other way is there something about this time where even like world war three which has been throwing around very casually concerningly so even that the new cycle wipes that away yeah well i i think we have this this general problem that we can't make certain information even you know unequivocally certain information emotionally salient like like we we we respond quite readily to certain things i mean as we talked about we we respond to the the little girl who fell down a well i mean that just that gets a hundred percent of our emotional resources but the abstract probability that of nuclear war right even a high probability even just even an intolerable probability even if we put it at thirty percent right you know like it's just like that's that's russian roulette with a you know gun with three chambers and you know it's aimed at the heads not only your head but your kid's head and everyone's kid's head and it's it's just twenty four hours a day and i mean i think people who who have this is pre ukraine i think the people who have made it their business to you know professionally to think about the risk of nuclear war and to mitigate it you know people like graham allison or william perry or i mean i think they were putting like the the ongoing risk i mean just the risk that we're gonna have a proper nuclear war at at some point in the you know in the next generation people were putting it at you know something like fifty percent right they were living with this sword of damocles over our heads now you might wonder whether anyone can have reliable intuitions about the probability that kind of thing but the the status quo is truly alarming i mean we've got you know we've got icbms on i mean leave aside smaller exchanges and you know tactical nukes and how that could how we could have a world war you know based on you know incremental changes we've got the biggest bombs aimed at the biggest cities in both directions and it's old technology right and it's you know and it's vulnerable to some lunatic deciding to launch or or misreading you know bad data and we know we've been saved from nuclear war i think at least twice by you know soviet submarine commanders deciding i'm not gonna pass this up the chain chain of command right like this is this is almost certainly an error is and it turns out it was an error and it's like like and we we need people to i mean in that particular case like he saw i think it was five what seemed like five missiles launched from the us to russia and he he reasoned if the if america was gonna engage in a first strike they'd launch more than five missiles right so this this has to be fictional and then he waited long enough to decide that it was fictional but the probability of of a nuclear war happening by mistake or some other species of inadvertence you know misunderstanding technical malfunction that's intolerable forget about the the intentional use of it by by people who are you know driven crazy by some ideology and more and more technologies are enable a kind of scale of destruction and misinformation plays into this picture in a way that is especially scary i mean once you can get a deep fake of you know the any current president of the united states claiming to have launched a first strike you know and just you know send that everywhere but that could change the nature of truth and then we that might change the the engine we have for skepticism sharpen it the more you have deep taste might have ai and and digital watermarks that help us maybe we'll not trust any information that hasn't come through specific channels right i mean so if like in in my world it's like i i no longer feel the the need to you know respond to anything other than what i put out in in my channels of information it's like there's there's so much there are so many people who have clipped stuff of me that shows the opposite of what i was actually saying in context i mean the people who have like re edited my podcast audio to to make it seem like i said the opposite of what i was saying it's like unless i put it out you know you can't be sure that i actually said it you know i mean it's it's just but i don't know what it's like to live like that for all forms of information and i mean strangely i think it may require a a greater siloing of information in the end you know it's like it it it it's we're living through this sort of wild west period where everyone's got a newsletter and everyone's got a blog and everyone's got an opinion but once you can fake everything there might be a greater value for expertise yeah for experts but a more rigorous system for identifying who the experts are yeah or just or just knowing that you know it it's gonna be an arms race to authenticate information so it's like if if you can never trust a photograph yeah unless it has been vetted by getty images because only getty images has the resources to to authenticate the provenance of that photograph and and attest that it hasn't been meddled with by ai and again i don't even know if that's technically possible i mean maybe the whatever the tools available for this will be you know commodified and and the the cost will be driven to zero so quickly that everyone will be able to do it you know it could be like encryption but and it would be proven and tested most effectively first of course as always in porn yeah which is where most of human innovation technology happens first well i have to ask because ron howard the director asked this on twitter since we're talking about the threat of nuclear war and otherwise he asked i'd be interested in both your expectations for human society if when we move beyond mars will those societies be industrial based how will it be governed how will criminal infractions be dealt with when you read or watch sci fi what comes closest to sounding logical do you think about our society beyond earth if we colonize mars if we colonize space yeah well i i think i have a pretty humbling picture of that i mean so because we're still gonna be the apes that we are so we when you when you imagine colonizing mars you have to imagine a first fist fight on mars yeah you have to imagine a first murder on mars oh it's also infidelity yeah somebody extramarital affairs on mars right so it's it's gonna get really homely and boring really fast i think you know it's like only the space suits or what the other exigencies of of just living in that atmosphere or lack thereof will limit how badly we can behave on mars but do you think most of the interaction will be still in meat space versus digital do you think there'll be do you think we're like living through a transformation of of a kind where we're going to be doing more and more interaction in digital space like everything we've been complaining about twitter is it possible that twitter is just the early days of a broken system that's actually giving birth to a better working system that's ultimately digital i think we're gonna experience a pendulum swing back into the real world i mean i think many of us are experiencing that now anyway i mean just just wanting to have face to face encounters and spend less time on our phones and less time online i mean i think you know maybe everyone isn't going in that direction but i do notice it myself and i notice i mean once i got off twitter i then i noticed the people who were never on twitter right and then and and the people who were never basically i mean i know i have a lot of friends who were never on twitter yeah they and they actually never understood what i was doing on twitter it's like like they just like it it wasn't that they were seeing it and then reacting to it they just didn't know it's like it's like being on it's like i'm not on reddit either but i don't spend any time thinking about not being on reddit right it's like i just i'm just not on reddit do you think the pursuit of human happiness is better achieved more effectively achieved outside of twitter world well i i think all we have is our attention in the end and we we just have to notice what these various tools are doing to it and it's just it became very clear to me that it was an unrewarding use of my attention now it's not to say there isn't some digital platform that's conceivable that would be useful but and rewarding but yeah i mean we we just have you know our life is doled out to us in moments and we we have and we're continually solving this riddle of what is gonna suffice to make this moment engaging and meaningful and aligned with who i wanna be now and how i want the future to to look right we're all in this that we have this tension between being in the present and becoming in the future and you know it's a seeming paradox again it's not really a paradox but it can seem like i do think the ground truth for personal well-being is to find a mode of being where you can pay attention to the present moment and this is you know meditation by another name you can pay attention to the present moment with sufficient you know gravity that you recognize that that just consciousness itself in the present moment no matter what's happening is already a circumstance of freedom and and contentment and and tranquility like you can be happy now before anything happens mhmm before this next desire gets gratified before this next problem gets solved there's a there's this kind of ground truth that that you're free that consciousness is free and open and unencumbered by really any problem until you get lost in thought about all the problems that may yet be real for you so the ability to catch and observe consciousness that in itself is a source of happiness yeah without being lost in thought and and so what what this hap this happens haphazardly for people who don't meditate because they find something in their life that's so captivating it's so pleasurable it's so thrilling it it can even be scary but it can be even being scared is captivating like so so it gets it it it gets their attention right whatever it is if you like you know sebastian junger you know was wrote a great book about people's experience in war here you know it's like like it can be strangely it can be the best experience anyone's ever had because everything it's like only the moment matters right like the the bullet is whizzing by your head you're not thinking about your your four zero one k or that thing that you didn't say last week to the person you shouldn't have been talking about you're not thinking about twitter it's like you're just fully immersed in the present moment meditation is the only way i mean that that that word can mean many things to many people but what i mean by meditation is simply the discovery that there is a a a way to engage the present moment directly regardless of what's happening you don't need to be in a war you don't need to be having sex you don't need to be on drugs you don't need to be surfing you don't need nothing it doesn't have to be a peak experience it can be completely ordinary but you can recognize that in some basic sense there's only this and and everything else is something you're thinking you're thinking about the past you're thinking about the future and thoughts themselves have no substance right it's it's it's it's fundamentally mysterious that any thought ever really commandeers your sense of who you are and and makes you anxious or afraid or or angry or whatever it is and the more you discover that the half life of all these negative emotions that blow all of us around get much much shorter right and you can literally just you know the the anger that would have kept you angry for hours or days lasts you know four seconds because you just the moment it arises you recognize it and you can get off there you can decide at minimum you can decide whether it's useful to to stay angry at that moment and you know obviously it usually isn't and the illusion of free will is one of those thoughts yeah it's all just happening right like even the mindful and meditative response to this is just happening happening it's just like even the moments where you recognize or not recognize is just happening it's not that the the the this does open up a degree of freedom for a person but it's not a freedom that gives any motivation to the notion of free will it's just a new way of being in the world is there a difference between intellectually knowing free will as an illusion and yeah really experiencing it yeah yeah what's the what's the longest you've been able to experience the escape the illusion if you will well it it's always i i it's always obvious to me when i pay attention i mean when when i whenever i'm mindful the the term of jargon you know in the buddhist and and increasingly you know outside the buddhist context is is mindfulness right but there are sort of different levels of mindfulness and there's there's different degrees of insight into this but yeah so i mean what i'm calling evidence of lack of free will and lack of you know lack of the self i mean i got two sides of the same coin there's a sense of being a subject in the middle of experience to whom all experience refers mhmm the sense of i the sense of me and that's almost everybody's starting point when they they start to meditate and that's that's almost always the place people live most of their lives from i do think that gets interrupted in ways that get unrecognized i think people are constantly losing the sense of i they're losing the sense of subject object distance but they're not recognizing it and and meditation is the mode in which you can recognize you can you can both consciously precipitate it you can look for the self and fail to find it and then recognize its absence and that's the just the flip side of the coin of free will i mean the the the feeling of having free will is what it feels like to feel like a self who's thinking his thoughts and doing his actions and intending his intentions and the the man in the middle of the boat who's rowing that's the start that's the false starting point when you find that there's no one in the middle of the boat right or in fact there's no boat there's just the river there's just the flow of experience and there's no center to it and there's no place from which you would control it again even when you're doing thing this does not negate the difference between voluntary and involuntary behavior it's like i can voluntarily reach for this but when i'm paying attention i'm aware that everything is just happening like just the intention to move is just arising right and i'm in no position to know why it didn't arise a moment before or a moment later or a moment or or you know fifty percent stronger or weaker or you know so as to be ineffective or to be doubly effective where i lurched for it versus i move slow i mean not i'm i'm not i can never run the counterfactuals i can never i mean all all of this opens the door to a an even more disconcerting picture along the same lines which is subsumes this conversation about free will and it's the question of whether anything is ever possible like what if this is a question i i haven't thought a lot of about it but it's been a few years i've been kicking this question around so i mean what if only the actual is possible what if what if there was what if was so we live with this feeling of possibility we live with a sense that let me take a so you know i have two daughters i could have had a third child right so what does it mean to say that i could have had a third child or he said do you you don't have kids i don't think no so not that i know of yes so so the possibility might be there so what do we mean when we say you could have had a child or you might you you might have a child in the future like what what what is the space in real what's the relationship between possibility and actuality and reality is there a reality in which non actual things are nonetheless real and so there we have other categories of like non concrete things we have things that don't have spatial temporal dimension but they're nonetheless they they they nonetheless exist so like you know the integers right so numbers there's a there's a reality there's an abstract reality to numbers and this is it's philosophically interesting to think about these things so they're not like in some sense they're they're they're real and they're they're not merely invented by us they're discovered because they have structure that we can't impose upon them right it's not like they're not fictional characters like you know i mean hamlet and and superman also exist in some sense but they they exist at the level of of our own fiction and and abstraction but it's like there are true there are true and false statements you can make about hamlet there are true and false statements you can make about superman because our fiction the fictional worlds we've created have a certain kind of structure but again this is all abstract it's like it's all abstractable from any of its concrete instantiations it's not just in the comic books and just in the movies it's in our you know ongoing ideas about these characters but natural numbers or or the integers don't function quite that way i mean they're similar but they also have a structure that's purely a matter of discovery it's not you can't just make up whether numbers are prime you know if you give me two integers you know of of a certain size to let's you mentioned two enormous integers if i were to say okay well between those two integers they're exactly eleven prime numbers right that's a very specific claim about which i can be right or wrong and whether or not anyone knows i'm right or wrong so that's just there's a domain of facts there but these are abstract it's an abstract reality that relates in some way that's philosophically interesting metaphysically interesting to what we call real reality you know the spatial temporal order the physics of things but possibility at least in my view occupies a different space and this is something again my thoughts on this are pretty inchoate and i i i think i need to talk to a philosopher of physics and or physicist about how this may interact with with things like the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics that's an interesting right right exactly so i wonder if discoveries in physics like further proof or more concrete proof that many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics has some validity right if that completely starts to change things but even at that that's just more actuality so if if i took that seriously sure that's that's a case of and and truth is that happens even even if the the many worlds interpretation isn't true but we just imagine we have a physically infinite universe the implication of infinity is such that things will begin to repeat themselves yeah you know the farther you go in space right so the you know if if you just head out in one direction eventually you're gonna meet two people just like us having a conversation just like this and you're gonna meet them an infinite number of times in every you know infinite variety of permutations slightly different from this conversation right so i mean infinity is just so big that our intuitions of probability completely break down but what i'm suggesting is maybe probability isn't a thing right maybe there's only actuality if there's maybe there's only what happens and at every point along the way our notion of what could have happened or what might have happened is just that it's just a thought about what could have happened or might have happened so it's a fundamentally different thing if you can imagine a thing that doesn't make it real so they because that's that's where that possibility exists it's in your imagination right yeah and and possibility itself is a kind of spooky idea because it it too has a sort of structure right so like if i if i'm gonna say you know you could have had a daughter right last year so we're saying that's that's possible but not actual right that is a claim of the the things that are true and not true about that daughter right like it it has a kind of structure it's like i feel like there's a lot of fog around that the possibility it feels like almost like a useful narrative but what does it mean so like what does it mean if if we say you know i just did that but i'm it was conceivable that i wouldn't have done that right like it's possible that i i i just threw this cap but right i might not have done that so you're taking it very temporarily close to the original like what would appear as a decision whenever we're saying something is possible but not actual right like this thing just happened but it's concealed it's it's possible that it wouldn't have happened or they would have happened differently in what does that possibility consist like where is that what is for that to be real for the possibility to be real what are we what claim are we making about the universe well isn't that an extension of the idea that free will is an illusion that all we have is actuality that the possibility is an illusion yeah i'm just extending it beyond is this human action like it's it's this goes to the physics of things this is just everything like we're we're we're always telling ourselves a story yeah that includes possibility possibility is really compelling for some reason well yeah well because it's it's i mean so this yeah i mean this could sound just academic but it every backward looking regret or disappointment and every forward looking worry is completely dependent on this notion of possibility like every regret is based on the sense that something else i could have done something else something else could have happened every disposition to worry about the future is based on the feeling that there's this range of possibilities it could go either way and you know i i know whether whether or not there's such a thing as possibility you know i'm convinced that worry is almost never psychologically appropriate because the reality is that in any given moment either you can do something to solve the problem you're worried about or not so if you can do something just do it you know and if you can't your worrying is just causing you to suffer twice over right you're gonna you know you're gonna you're gonna get the medical procedure next week anyway how much time between now and next week do you wanna spend worrying about it right it's it's gonna it's the worry the worry doesn't accomplish anything how much do physicists think about possibility well they think about it in terms of probability more often but probability just describes and again this is a place where i'm i might be out of my depth and need to talk to somebody to to debunk this but the to do therapy with a physicist yeah but probability it seems just describes a pattern of actuality that we've observed right i mean we have there are certain things we observe and those are the actual things that have happened and we have this additional story about probability i mean is it we have the frequency with which things happen have happened in the past you know i i can flip a fair coin and know i know in the abstract that i have a belief that in the limit those flips you know those tosses should converge on fifty percent heads and fifty percent tails i know i have a story as to why it's not gonna be exactly fifty percent within any arbitrary time frame but in reality all we ever have are the observed tosses right and then we have an additional story that oh it came up heads but it could have come up tails why do we think that about that last toss what and and what are we claiming is true about the physics of things if we say it could have been otherwise i think we're claiming that probability is true that it just it it allows us to have a nice model about the world it gives us hope about the world yeah it seems that possibility has to be somewhere to be effective it's a little it's a little bit like what's what's happening with the laws of there's something metaphysically interesting about the laws of nature too because the laws of nature so the laws of nature impose their their work on the world right we see their evidence but they're not reducible to any specific set of instances right so there's some structure there but the structure isn't just a matter of the actual things we have the actual billiard balls that are banging into each other all of that actuality can be explained by what things are actually doing but then we have this notion that in addition to that we have the laws of nature that are making they're explaining this act but but how are the laws of nature an additional thing in addition to just the actual things that are actually effect costly and if if they're if they are an additional thing in how are they effective if not they're not among the actual things that are just actually banging around yeah and so to some degree for that possibility has to be hiding somewhere for the laws of nature to be possible like for for anything to be possible it has to be it has to be closet somewhere i'm sure where all the possibility goes it has to be attached to something so i mean you don't think many worlds is that yeah well or because many worlds still exists well because we're in this strand of that multiverse yeah right so it's still still you have just a local instance of what is actual yeah and then if it proliferates elsewhere where you can't be affected by it you can't really connect with the other yeah yeah and so many worlds are just a statement of basically everything that can happen happens somewhere right and that's yeah you know and that's i mean maybe that's not an entirely kosher formulation of it but it it seems pretty close so so but there's whatever happens right in fact there's you know relativistically there's a there's an you know the the einstein's original notion of a block universe seems to suggest this and i it's been a while since i've been in a conversation with a physicist where i've gotten a chance to ask about the standing of this concept in physics currently i don't i don't hear it discussed much but the idea of a block universe is that you know space time exists as a totality and our sense that we are traveling through space time where there's a a real difference between the past and the future that that's an illusion of just our you know you know weird the weird weird slice we're taking of of this larger object but on some level it's like you know you're reading a novel the the last page of the novel exists just as much as the first page when you're in the middle of it and they're just you know if that's if we're living in anything like that then there's no such thing as possibility i i would it would seem as just what is actual so as a matter of our experience moment to moment i think it's totally compatible with that being true that there is only what is actual and that sounds to the naive ear that sounds like it would be depressing and disempowering and confining but it's anything but it's actually it's a circumstance of pure discovery like you have no idea what's gonna happen next right you don't know who you're gonna be tomorrow you're only by it's you know it seems true to many people and yet it's you know it seems true to many people and yet the basic insight is that you're not you're not in the the the real freedom is is the recognition that you're not in control of anything everything is just happening including your thoughts and intentions and moods so life is a is a is a process of continuous discovery yeah you're part of the universe yeah you are you are just this i mean it's it's the miracle that the the universe is illuminated to itself as itself where you sit and you're and you're continually discovering what your life is and then you're you have this layer at which you're telling yourself a story that you already know what your life is and you know exactly you know who you should be and what's you know what's about to happen or you're struggling to form a confident opinion about all of that and yet there is this this fundamental mystery to everything even the most familiar experience we're all npcs in in a most marvelous video game maybe although my my game my sense of gaming is does not run as deep as to know what i'm committing to there a non it's a nonplaying character you're more yeah non player oh wow yeah yes you're more you're more of a mario kart guy yeah yeah i went back i was an an original video gamer but it's been a long time since i i mean i was i was there for pong i remember when i saw the the first pong in a restaurant in i think it was like benihana's or something they had a pong in a table and that was isn't it amazing that an amazing moment when you you sam harris might live from pong to the invention and deployment of a superintelligent system yeah well that that happened fast if it happens anytime in my lifetime from from pong to agi yeah what kind of things do you do purely for fun that others might consider a waste of time purely for fun because meditation doesn't count because most people would say that's not a waste of time is there something like pong that's a deeply embarrassing thing you would never admit i don't think well i mean once or twice a year i will play a round of golf which many people would find embarrassing they might even find my play embarrassing but it's fun do you find it embarrassing no i mean i i love golf just takes way too much time so i can only squander a certain amount of time on it i i i do love it it's it's a lot of fun well you have no control over your actual performance you're you're ever discovering i i do i do have i have i have control over my mediocre performance but it's i don't have enough controls to make it really good but happily i don't i i'm in the perfect spot because i don't invest enough time in it to care how i play so i just have fun when i play well i i i hope there'll be a day where you play around golf with the former president donald trump and i would love to be i would bet on him if we play golf i'm sure he's a better golfer amidst the chaos of human civilization in modern times as we've talked about what gives you hope about this world in the coming year in the coming decade in the coming hundred years maybe a thousand years what's the source of hope for you well it comes back to a few of the things we've talked about i mean i i think i'm i'm hopeful that i know that most people are good and are mostly converging on the same core values right it's like we're we're not surrounded by psychopaths and i the the thing that finally convinced me to to get off twitter was how different life was seeming through the lens of twitter it's like i i just got the sense that there's there are way more psychopaths or effective psychopaths than i realized and then i thought okay that's this isn't real this is this is either a strange context in which actually decent people are behaving like psychopaths or it's you know it's a bot army or something that i don't have to take seriously so yeah i just think most people if we can get the if we can get the incentives right i think there's no reason why we can't really thrive collectively like there's enough wealth to go around there's enough you know there's no there's no effective limit you know i mean again within the limits of what's physically possible but we're we're nowhere near the limit on abundance you know on this forget about going to mars on this the one rock right it's like we we could make this place incredibly beautiful and stable if we just did enough work to solve some you know you know rather long standing political problems you know the problem of incentives so that to you the the basic characteristics of human nature such that we'll be okay if the incentives are okay we'll we'll do we'll we'll do pretty good i'm worried about the asymmetries that you know it's easier to break things than to fix them it's easier to to light a fire than to put it out and i do worry that you know as technology gets more and more powerful it becomes easier for the minority who wants to screw things up to effectively screw things up for everybody right so it's it's easier it's like a thousand years ago it was simply impossible for one person to derange the lives of millions much less billions now that's getting to be possible so on the assumption that we're always gonna have a sufficient number of crazy individuals or or malevolent individuals it's it's that is we have to figure out that asymmetry somehow and so there's some cautious exploration of emergent technology that we need to get our our heads screwed on straight about so like so gain of function research like just how much do we wanna democratize you know all the relevant technologies there you know do we want really you really wanna give everyone the ability to order nucleotides in the mail and and give them the blueprints for viruses online because of you know you're a free speech absolutist and you think all pdfs need to be you know exportable everywhere so i'm much more so this is where yeah so there are limits to i'm not many people are confused about my take on free speech because i've come down on on on the unpopular side of some of these questions but it's been my overriding concern is that in in many cases i'm worried about free speech of the individual businesses or individual platforms or individual you know media people to decide that they don't want to be associated with certain things right so like if if you own twitter i think you should be able to kick off the nazi you don't wanna be associated with because it's your platform you own it right that's your free speech right that's the side of my free speech concern for twitter right it's not that every nazi has the right to to be to algorithmic speech on twitter i think if you own twitter you should you or the you know whether it's just elon or you know in the world where it wasn't elon just the the people who own twitter the the and the board and the shareholders and the employees these people need to can should be free to decide what they want to promote or not i view them as publishers more than as platforms in the end and that has other implications but i do worry about this problem of misinformation and algorithmically and otherwise you know supercharged misinformation and i think i do think we have a we're at a bottleneck now i mean i i guess it's it's could be the hubris of every present generation to think that their moment is especially important but i do think with the emergence of these technologies we're some kind of bottleneck where we really have to figure out how to get this right and if we do get this right if we figure out how to not drive ourselves crazy by giving people access to all the all possible information and misinformation at all times i think yeah we could there's no limit to how happily we could collaborate with billions of creative fulfilled people you know it's just and trillions of robots some of them sex robots but then some other topics robots that have are running the right algorithm whatever that algorithm is whatever you need in your life to make you happy so i i was the first time we talked is one of the huge honors of my life i've been a fan of yours for a long time the few times you were respectful but critical to me means the world and thank you so much for helping helping me and caring enough and caring enough about the world and for everything you do but i should say that the the few of us that try to put love in the world on twitter miss you on twitter but this enjoy yourselves don't don't break anything else have a good party without me thanks so much very very happy to do this thanks thanks for the invitation thank you great to see you again thanks for listening to this conversation with sam harris to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from martin luther king junior love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend thank you for listening i'd hope to see you next time
